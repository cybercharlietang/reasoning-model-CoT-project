    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10, which is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a number, it's 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is 484 = 48*10 + 4. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place (second digit from the right):** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Let's count how many such groups there are. From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each hundred has a group where the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers each. So, how many hundreds are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488. So, each hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10 = 40 numbers. But wait, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50. Wait, no, let me think again. The first hundred (1-100) has 40-49, which is 10 numbers. The second hundred (101-200) has 140-149, another 10. Third hundred (201-300) has 240-249, 10. Fourth hundred (301-400) has 340-349, 10. Then, the fifth hundred would be 401-500, but our book stops at 488, so in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place (third digit from the right):** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers are there where the hundreds digit is 4? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, no, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, that's 89 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included, so 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's are 187. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll count the number of 8's in each place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these groups has 10 numbers. Let's see how many such groups there are. From 1-488, we have four groups: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4 groups, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10 = 40. Now, does 480-488 have any tens digit 8? Yes, 480-488: the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but earlier, I thought it was 10 numbers, but in this case, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers because 488 is the end. So, that's an additional 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but earlier I thought 488 is included, so the tens digit in 480-488 is 8, which is 9 numbers. So, total 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, total 8's are 97. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90. Wait, that's 90. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recount the 4's and 8's again. For 4's: units place: 48, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. Total 4's: 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. For 8's: units place: 48, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. Total 8's: 48+49=97. So, 187-97=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, especially in the tens place, I might have missed something. Let me check the tens place for 4's again. From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five groups, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct. For 8's in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five groups, but the last one is only 9 numbers because 488 is the end. So, 4 groups of 10 and 1 group of 9, totaling 49. That's correct. So, yes, 48+49=97 for 8's. Therefore, the difference is 187-97=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 48 such numbers.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each group has 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 such numbers.\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 48 such numbers.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four groups have 10 each, and the last has 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n- **Total 8's:** 48 + 49 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of 4's in the units place would be the total number of complete decades (groups of 10) multiplied by 1, plus any extra in the incomplete group. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times 1 is 48. But wait, in the last incomplete decade, from 480 to 488, the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is included, which is the 48th 4. So, that's 48 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Let me figure out how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, the next would be 140-149, another 10, then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid, but 540-549 would be beyond 488, so that's not included. So, how many blocks? From 40-49: 10 numbers, then 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. Pages from 400 to 488 have 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so the last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 numbers. Wait, wait, because 488 is included, so from 8 to 488, that's (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. That would be numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, how many blocks? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, total 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can only be 1,2,3,4. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through each digit place again for both 4's and 8's to confirm. For 4's: Units place: 48, correct because 488/10=48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4, and since 488 is less than 490, the 48th 4 is at 484. Tens place: 5 blocks (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449), each with 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Total 4's: 48+50+89=187. For 8's: Units place: 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers (since 488 is included). Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's: 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I think about the hundreds place for 8's, since the book only goes up to 488, there's no page number starting with 8 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. Hmm, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4 full blocks and one partial block with 9 numbers. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, that's correct. Similarly, for units place, 49 numbers with 8. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, the difference is 187-98=89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 48 occurrences (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences (since 488 is included).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 numbers, and the last block contributes 9 numbers.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **89**.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Well, starting from 4, each subsequent number is 10 more. So, the last number would be 484. Let me see how many numbers that is. The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. Here, first term is 4, last term is 484, common difference is 10. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. Wait, but wait a second. 484 is the last term, which is within 488, so that's correct. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, and so on. How many sets of 100 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. So, for the tens place, 4 appears in the tens place in each of these hundreds. Let's see: in 1-100, 40-49: 10 numbers. In 101-200, 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249 and 340-349 each have 10. Now, in 400-488, the tens place is 4 in 440-449. So that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's: 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. Each number here has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me double-check: 400 is the first, then 401, 402,... up to 488. So, yes, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, the last number with 8 in the units place is 488. Let me calculate how many such numbers there are. Using the same formula: ((last term - first term)/10) + 1. First term is 8, last term is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 = 480/10 = 48. Then +1 gives 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let me see how many sets there are. From 1-100: 80-89: 10 numbers. 101-200: 180-189: 10. 201-300: 280-289: 10. 301-400: 380-389: 10. Then 401-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, each of the first four sets (80-89, etc.) contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, same for 180-189, etc. So, that's 4 sets, each with 10, so 40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so total 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place 8's: 0. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Well, starting from 4, each subsequent number is 10 more. So, the first number is 4, and the last number in this sequence under 488 would be 484. To find how many terms there are, I can use the formula: ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 484 is the 49th term. But let me check: 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place, the 4 can appear in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, let's count how many such ranges there are. Starting from 40-49, that's one set. Then 140-149, that's another, and so on. The last one would be 440-449. How many sets are there? From 0 to 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 5 sets (0,1,2,3,4). Each set contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, the last set is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, for the hundreds place, the 4 can appear in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the last number would be 488. Let's check how many terms there are. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, each of these ranges except the last one has 10 numbers, but the last one has 9 numbers (480-488). Let's count how many sets: from 0 to 4 in the hundreds place, that's 5 sets. Each set except the last one has 10 numbers, and the last one has 9. So, for the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributes 10 numbers, so 4 * 10 = 40. The last set (480-488) contributes 9 numbers. So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488. This range has 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No numbers since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but let me check: from 4 to 484, that's 484 - 4 = 480, which is 48 groups of 10, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is correct. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? Well, from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, that's 5 ranges, but the last range is only up to 488, not 499. Let's calculate each range: - 40-49: 10 numbers (40-49) \u2192 10 4's in the tens place. - 140-149: another 10 \u2192 total 20. - 240-249: another 10 \u2192 total 30. - 340-349: another 10 \u2192 total 40. - 440-449: another 10 \u2192 total 50. Wait, but the last range is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding them all up: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's printed are 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups. So, 48 8's in the units place. Wait, but 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8's in the tens place occur in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's check each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers \u2192 10 8's. - 180-189: another 10 \u2192 total 20. - 280-289: another 10 \u2192 total 30. - 380-389: another 10 \u2192 total 40. - 480-488: this is only 9 numbers (480-488), because 488 is the last page. So, that's 9 8's in the tens place. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units place (48) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, total 8's printed are 97. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, when counting the tens place for 4's, I had 5 ranges each with 10 numbers, so 50 4's in the tens place. But let me confirm: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 ranges, so 5\u00d710=50, correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, I had 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4 full ranges of 10 and one partial range of 9, totaling 49. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: from 4 to 484, which is 488/10 = 48.8, so 48 times. Similarly for 8's, 48 times. Wait, but in the units place, 488 is included, which is an 8, so 488 is the 48th occurrence. So, that's correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place, 4's are from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. 8's in hundreds place: none, since the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, adding up: 4's = 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n8's = 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, but I thought the answer might be 90, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89, correct. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but 400-488 includes 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, 9 8's there.\n\nSo, total 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nTotal 8's: 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\nDifference: 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (ones place):** Every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of 10, so 48 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The ranges are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 5\u00d710=50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** Pages 400-488 have 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to 4's, there are 48 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** Ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No pages have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 187\n   - Number of 8's: 97\n   - Difference: 187 - 97 = 90\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete groups of 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, it's 48 full groups, each contributing one 4. But wait, in the 480-488 range, the units digit 4 appears at 484, so that's the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in the 1-99 range, we have 40-49, which is 10 numbers. In the 100-199 range, 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times. Wait, but 400 is included, right? So, yes, 89 times. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups. But wait, in the 480-488 range, the units digit 8 appears at 488, so that's the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 1-99, 80-89 is 10 numbers. Then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. So that's 4 ranges, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 would be in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, the 480-489 range would be 10 numbers, but since we stop at 488, it's 9. So, does that affect the count? Let me think. When counting the tens place, for 8 in the tens place, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, the first four are full 10s, and the last one is 9 numbers. So, total for tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 4 ranges, but actually, it's 5 ranges, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, total is 4*10 + 9 = 49. Hmm, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, yes, 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 800, but wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times. So, adding up the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48+49=97. So, 97 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. Seems correct. For 8's: units 48, tens 49, hundreds 0. 48+49=97. So, 187-97=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 8's. Let me recount that. In the tens place, 8 can be in 80-89, which is 10 numbers, 180-189, another 10, 280-289, another 10, 380-389, another 10, and 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. So, 49 times in the tens place. Units place: every 10 numbers, so 488/10=48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. So, 48+49=97. So, yes, 97 times. Therefore, 187-97=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to how many complete groups of 10 there are. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, let me check: the last number with a 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 48th occurrence (since 484 = 48*10 + 4). So, that's 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: from 1-99, there's one block (40-49). From 100-199, another block (140-149). From 200-299, another block (240-249). From 300-399, another block (340-349). From 400-488, the block would be 440-449. So that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does the last block go up to 449? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. That would be all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? Let's calculate: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times. Now, adding up the number of 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is included because it's the last page. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's see: from 1 to 488, the number of such numbers is 488 / 10 = 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is exactly 48*10 + 8, so the last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, because 8 is the first occurrence at 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? Let's calculate: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 numbers. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 80-89 is one block. From 100-199: 180-189 is another. From 200-299: 280-289 is another. From 300-399: 380-389 is another. From 400-488: The next block would be 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, for the hundreds place, each full block contributes 10, and the last block contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 from 480-488. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, there are 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, that seems off because when I calculated the hundreds place for 4's, I got 89, which is exactly the difference. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total 187. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total 98. Difference: 187-98=89. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check again. Wait, in the units place for 4's, I had 48 numbers. Let me confirm: from 4,14,24,...,484. 484 is the 48th number because (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49? Wait, no, that would be 49 numbers. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recalculate the units place for 4's. The first number is 4, then every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is floor((488 - 4)/10) +1. So, (488 -4)=484, 484/10=48.4, floor is 48, so 48 +1=49. So, units place for 4's is 49, not 48. Wait, that changes things. Similarly, for 8's in the units place, I had 49. So, if 4's in units place is 49, then 4's total would be 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Then, 8's total is 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98. So, difference is 188-98=90. Wait, now I'm confused. Let me make sure. Let me think: For units place, the number of times a digit d appears is given by floor((n - d)/10) +1, where n is the maximum number. So, for 4's in units place: floor((488 -4)/10)=floor(484/10)=48.4, floor is 48, so 48 +1=49. So, 49 times. Similarly, for 8's in units place: floor((488 -8)/10)=floor(480/10)=48, so 48 +1=49. So, both have 49 in units place. Now, for 4's in tens place: The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block of 100 contributes 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. 100-199:140-149. 200-299:240-249. 300-399:340-349. 400-488:440-449. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, except the last one which is 440-449, which is 10 numbers because 449 is less than 488. Wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers: 440,441,...,449. So, 5 blocks *10=50. So, 50 times. For 4's in hundreds place: numbers from 400-488. How many numbers? 488 -400 +1=89. So, 89 times. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. Now for 8's in tens place: The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 numbers. The last block, 480-488, contributes 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place:4*10 +9=49. Units place for 8's:49, as calculated earlier. Hundreds place for 8's:0. So, total 8's:49+49=98. Therefore, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, so I initially thought 89, but after correcting the units place for 4's, it's 90. Let me confirm once more. 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=188. 8's: units=49, tens=49. Total=98. Difference=188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct now.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers. From 4 to 484, there are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 8 to 488, there are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full blocks and a partial block (480-488), totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book only goes up to 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Let's see: the first is 4, then every 10th number after that. So, the count would be the integer division of 488 by 10, which is 48, plus 1 if the remainder is 0 or more, but since 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, the last number ending with 4 is 484, which is 48*10 + 4 = 484. So, that's 49 times? Wait, no, because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is beyond 48*10 + 4 (which is 484), we have 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then in the 49th group, from 480 to 488, there's 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, total 49 4's in the units place. Wait, but let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? It's (488 + 1) divided by 10, but actually, it's the floor of (488 / 10) which is 48, but since 488 is 48*10 + 8, the last number ending with 4 is 484, which is the 48th occurrence plus one more, making it 49? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The number of numbers ending with 4 is equal to the number of times 4 appears in the units place. For each ten, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., each has exactly one number ending with 4. So, from 1 to 480, there are 480/10 = 48 such numbers. Then, from 481 to 488, there's 484, which is another one. So total 49 4's in the units place. Okay, that seems right.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the possible tens places where 4 can be are in the 40s, 140s, 240s, 340s, and 440s. Let's count them:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nBut wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, each of these contributes 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, correct. Then 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. So that's 5\u00d710=50. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there where the hundreds digit is 4? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The hundreds place is only for three-digit numbers, so from 100 to 999. But in our case, up to 488. So, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, for the hundreds place being 4, it's from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed are 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Wait, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, correct. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Units place: 49, tens:50, so total 188. Hmm.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place:** How many numbers from 1 to 488 end with 8? Similar to the 4's, it's every 10 numbers. So, from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the last number ending with 8 is 488 itself. So, how many? It's 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8, and then 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is included, so from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, how many numbers? Let's see: the first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 can appear in the tens place. The ranges would be 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be another range, but since the book only goes up to 488, we have to adjust the last range.\n\nSo, let's count:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: Here, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, the 8 is in the tens digit for these numbers, but only 9 numbers instead of 10.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4\u00d710=40 plus 9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, can 8 appear in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's are 188, total 8's are 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99+89=188\n\n8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** Every 10 numbers contribute one 4. From 1 to 488, there are 49 such numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** Each range of 100 numbers (40-49, 140-149, etc.) contributes 10 4's. There are 5 such ranges, totaling 50 4's.\n3. **Hundreds place:** Numbers from 400 to 488 contribute 89 4's.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, there are 49 numbers ending with 8.\n2. **Tens place:** Ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488 contribute 49 8's.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " The first one is 4 and the last one is 484. To find how many terms there are, I can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: (Last term - First term) / Common difference + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. Wait, but let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the number of 4's in the units place would be 48 times from 4 to 484, but actually, 484 is the 49th term because starting at 4, each step adds 10. So, yes, 49 is correct. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 4's. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: Units (49) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8's appear every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many terms there are. The first term is 8, and the last term is 488. Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. Wait, but 488 is included, so that's correct. 2. **Tens place:** 8's in the tens place occur in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let me count how many full blocks there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is one block (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 is another (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 is another (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 is another (10 numbers). Now, from 400-488: 480-488 is a partial block. How many numbers are there from 480 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, the tens place 8's are in 4 full blocks (each contributing 10) and one partial block contributing 9. So, total 8's in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the book.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484\n   - Number of terms: \\( \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 49 \\)\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449\n   - Each block contributes 10 4's.\n   - Total: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\)\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Numbers: 400-488\n   - Total numbers: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\)\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\)\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488\n   - Number of terms: \\( \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 49 \\)\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488\n   - Full blocks: 4, contributing \\( 4 \\times 10 = 40 \\)\n   - Partial block (480-488): 9 numbers\n   - Total: \\( 40 + 9 = 49 \\)\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No 8's as the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 = 98 \\)\n\n**Difference:**\n\\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one number ending with 4. So, how many blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4, and then a partial block from 481 to 488. In that partial block, 484 is the last number ending with 4. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, actually, let me check that again. If I do 488 divided by 10, it's 48 full tens and 8 extra numbers. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 full times plus one more in the 480-488 range, which is 484. So, 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.), there's a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88. So, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these contributes 10 numbers with a tens digit of 4, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's another 10 numbers. So, total tens digit 4's are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 50 in total for the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds again. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, and then in the last partial block, 488 is included. So, 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count these. Each hundred has one such range, so in 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers with tens digit 8. So, 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the 400-488 range, does the tens digit 8 appear? Yes, in 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 more. Therefore, total tens digit 8's are 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book goes only up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Thus, hundreds digit 8's = 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in 1-488.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of 4's in the units place is the total number of tens places divided by 10. Wait, let me think again. The number of times a digit appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in the total range. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? It's 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does that mean 48 times? But actually, each group of 10 has exactly one 4 in the units place, so it's 48 times. However, wait, 488 is the last page, so the last group is 481-490, but since we stop at 488, the last group isn't complete. So, does that affect the count? Let me check. The last group is 481-490, but we only go up to 488, so the units digit goes up to 8. So, in this last group, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the number of 4's in the units place in the last group is 1, because 484 is within 481-488. So, total units place 4's: 48 (from 1-480) + 1 (from 481-488) = 49. Wait, but let me think again. From 1-480, how many 4's in units place? 4,14,24,...,484. Each ten has one, so 480/10 = 48. Then, from 481-488, we have 484, which is another 4. So, total is 48 +1=49. Okay, so 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's count the 4's in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, and so on up to 440-449. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5*10=50. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 440-449, which is entirely within 488. So, no problem there. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's. So, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's count how many such numbers. From 1-488, the number of complete groups of 10 is 48, as before. Each group contributes one 8 in the units place, so 48. But wait, let me check the last group again. From 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included. So, in the last group, 488 is present, so that's another 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's: 48 (from 1-480) +1 (from 481-488) =49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8's in the tens place occur in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, how many 8's in the tens place? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Well, starting from 4, each subsequent 4 in the units place occurs every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 488, how many such numbers are there? Let me calculate. The first 4 is at 4, and the last one before 488 would be 484. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The formula for the number of terms is ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. Here, last term is 484, first term is 4, common difference is 10. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's look at the tens place. The 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set would be 440-449. Let's count how many numbers are in each of these ranges. Each range has 10 numbers, right? So, 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. That's 5 ranges, so 5*10 = 50. Wait, but wait a second. The last range is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me check: 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, yes. So, 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 = 99, and 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 488 count? Yes, because the units digit is 8. So, how many such numbers? Starting at 8, each subsequent 8 in the units place is every 10 pages. So, the first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many terms? Using the same formula: ((last term - first term)/10) +1. Last term is 488, first term is 8. So, (488 - 8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place. The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers. But the last one, 480-488, has only 9 numbers because 489 is beyond 488. So, let's calculate: 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800 onwards. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, does 488 include an extra 4? Let me check: 488 is the last page, which is 488, so the units digit is 8, not 4. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 for pages 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding them up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's are 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8's appear every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so does that add an extra 8? Let me check: 488 is the last page, so units digit is 8. So, the number of 8's in the units place is 48 (from 1-480) plus 1 (488), totaling 49. Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th occurrence. Let me think again: from 1-488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. So, the count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8's in the tens place occur in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 80-89 is one range (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-489, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, so does that affect the count? Let me clarify. The tens digit is 8, so the numbers are 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds place 4, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, for the tens place, the ranges are:\n\n- 80-89: 10\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9\n\nSo, total 10 + 10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49 =98.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in the units place. Earlier, for 4's, the units place was 48, but for 8's, I got 49. Let me confirm that.\n\nFrom 1-488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, the sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. To find how many terms there are, we can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)*d. Here, a_1=8, d=10, a_n=488. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2192 480 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 terms, which means 49 8's in the units place. That's correct.\n\nFor the tens place, as I thought earlier, we have 49 8's. So total 8's are 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98.\n\nWait, but earlier for 4's, I had 187. So, 4's are 187, 8's are 98. So, the difference is 187 -98=89. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's in the tens place. I had 5 ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That seems right.\n\nIn the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's there. So, 48 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's, units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds place:0, total 98. So, 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. I had 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 187-98=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 48 such numbers (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, truncating to 48).\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. There are 89 such pages (488 - 400 + 1).\n   - **Total '4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers (since 488 is included).\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 such full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 numbers, and an additional 9 numbers in 480-488. Totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 187\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 187 - 98 = 89\n\n**Answer:** There are 89 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full cycles of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each full cycle, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. Now, in the extra numbers (481-488), does 484 have a 4 in the units place? Yes, 484 is included, so that's one more. So total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. Wait, actually, let me think again. From 1 to 480, it's 480 numbers, which is 48 sets of 10, so 48 fours. Then, from 481 to 488, that's 8 numbers: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. Among these, only 484 has a 4 in the units place. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 fours in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count how many such groups there are. From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, 40-49: 10 numbers. 140-149: 10 numbers. 240-249: 10 numbers. 340-349: 10 numbers. 440-449: 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, that's 5 groups, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so all 5 groups are within 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, but the digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's calculate how many. From 1 to 488, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the last number is 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such groups there are. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10 numbers. 280-289: 10 numbers. 380-389: 10 numbers. Now, 480-489 would be another group, but since the book only goes up to 488, we only have 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but in the tens place, the 8 is in the tens digit, so 480-488 is part of the 480-489 group, but only up to 488. So, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, we have 4 full groups (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, the partial group 480-488 contributes 9 eights in the tens place. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 480-488 has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), each with 8 in the tens place. So, yes, 9 more eights. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place would be the number of tens in 488. That is, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 488 itself is included, so maybe I should check if 488 ends with a 4 in the units place. 488 ends with an 8, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484. So, from 4, 14, ..., 484, that's 48 numbers. So, 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in the first 100 pages (1-100), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49). Similarly, in 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10. In 200-299, it's 240-249, another 10. In 300-399, it's 340-349, another 10. Then in 400-488, it's 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in each of these, the hundreds digit is 4. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, but I think I need to check if I'm counting correctly. From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll check each place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, from 8, 18, ..., 488, that's 49 numbers because 488 is the 49th number. Wait, let me check: 8 is the first, 18 is the second, ..., 488 is the 49th. Because (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in the following ranges: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, ..., 484.

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to how many complete groups of 10 there are. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 488 include 488? Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but the last number in the units place would be 484, which is 48 times 10 plus 4. So, yes, 48 times. So, 48 fours in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. Starting from 40-49: that's one block. Then 140-149: second block. 240-249: third. 340-349: fourth. 440-449: fifth. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 times 10 is 50. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 440-449, which is within 488. So, 5 blocks, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so integer part is 48. So, 48 eights in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so the last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence? Wait, no, because 8, 18, ..., 488: let's count how many. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8. So, 48 eights. But wait, the 48th decade would end at 480, so 480 is the 48th multiple. Then, 481-488 is the next set, which includes 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's the 49th occurrence. So, actually, it's 49 eights in the units place. Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. Let me think: 8 is 1*8, 18 is 2*8, ..., 488 is 49*8? Wait, no, that's not correct. The number of multiples of 10 is 48 full decades, and then the 49th number is 488, which is 48*10 + 8. So, 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, plus one more 8 in 488. So, total 49 eights in the units place. Wait, but earlier I thought 488 is part of the 49th decade, but actually, 488 is the last number in the 48th decade plus 8. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to the number of times 8 is the last digit from 1 to 488. So, starting at 8, every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms are there? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The common difference is 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit being 8. These numbers are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many blocks there are. Each block is 10 numbers, except possibly the last one. 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights in the tens place. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: how many? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, each of these blocks contributes 10 eights except the last one, which contributes 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10, which is 40, plus 9 from the last block, totaling 49. Wait, no: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 to 899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Wait, but let me double-check. Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 49 eights. So, total 98. Now, the number of fours was 187, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the eights. Let me recount the units place: from 8, 18, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers, so 49 eights. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49 in tens place. So, total eights: 49+49=98. Fours: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, plus 89=187. So, 187-98=89. So, the answer should be 89 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   Number of 4's = \u230a488 / 10\u230b = 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers:  \n   - 40-49: 10 numbers  \n   - 140-149: 10 numbers  \n   - 240-249: 10 numbers  \n   - 340-349: 10 numbers  \n   - 440-449: 10 numbers  \n   Total = 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.  \n   Number of 4's = 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's = 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   Number of 8's = \u230a488 / 10\u230b + 1 (since 488 is included) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers:  \n   - 80-89: 10 numbers  \n   - 180-189: 10 numbers  \n   - 280-289: 10 numbers  \n   - 380-389: 10 numbers  \n   - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)  \n   Total = 4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book only goes up to 488.  \n   Number of 8's = 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.**\n\n**Difference:**\n\nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " The first 4 is at 4, and the last one before 488 is 484. To find how many there are, I can calculate how many steps of 10 fit into 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the last group would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the 484 is the last one. So, from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, that seems off because 488/10 is 48.8, so maybe it's 48 times? Hmm, let me think again. The number of 4's in the units place is the number of times 4 appears in the ones place from 1 to 488. The formula is usually floor((n + 1) / 10) for each digit. So, for 488, it would be floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10) = 48. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, for the tens place, 4 can appear in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in 1-488, there are 4 complete hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 400-488. In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 in one range of 10 numbers. So, that's 4 times 10 = 40. But wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total is 5 sets of 10, which is 50 times. Wait, no, because 400-488 is part of the 400s, so the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens digit 4's: from 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. So, total 4's in hundreds place: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th number. So, from 8 to 488, that's (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of this. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers except the last one, which has 9 (480-488). So, let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the number of 4's in the units place is equal to how many times 4 appears in the ones place. Since every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place, I can calculate how many such blocks there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. Each block contributes one 4, so 48 times. But wait, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which adds one more 4. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in each hundred block. So, 40-49 is the first block, 140-149 the second, 240-249 the third, 340-349 the fourth, and 440-449 the fifth. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me calculate how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such blocks are there. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in each hundred block. So, 80-89 is the first, 180-189 the second, 280-289 the third, 380-389 the fourth. Now, 480-489 would be the fifth, but since the book only goes up to 488, the tens digit is 8 only up to 488. So, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but in the tens place, each block is 100 numbers. So, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. But wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, do I count that as an additional 9? Wait, no, because 480-488 is part of the 400-499 range, but the book only goes up to 488. So, in the tens place, the 8 appears in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 full blocks and one partial block. So, total 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place. Wait, but wait, let me check that. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in the following ranges: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the Digit 4:**\n1. **Units Place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens Place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds Place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting the Digit 8:**\n1. **Units Place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens Place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds Place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? It's the same as the number of decades (groups of 10) times 1 (since each decade has exactly one number ending with 4). There are 48 full decades in 488 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8), but since we can't have a fraction of a decade, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last number ending with 4 is 484, which is 48th decade (480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488). So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 (including the first 4). Wait, no, actually, for each full decade, there's one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, there are 48 such numbers, and then 484 is the next one, which is within 481-488. So that's 49 times. Hmm, but wait, 488 is the last page, so the last number ending with 4 is 484, which is 480 +4, so that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, actually, 488 is the last page, so the units digit 4 occurs in 4,14,...,484. Let me calculate how many terms are there in this sequence. The first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 -4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times the digit 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one range, so 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another range, 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249, 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349, 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449 is the next range, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10 numbers. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5*10=50 times. Wait, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's fine. So, total 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens for all numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, let's do the same for 8's. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last number ending with 8 is 488. Let's calculate how many such numbers there are. The first term is 8, last term is 488, common difference 10. Number of terms: ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Now, let's count how many full ranges we have and if the last range is partial. From 1-99: 80-89, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289, 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389, 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 numbers. So, the first four ranges contribute 4*10=40, and the last range contributes 9. So total tens place 8's: 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit '4':**\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " The first such number is 4, and the last is 484. To find how many there are, I can divide 484 by 10, which gives 48.4, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4, so that's correct. So, 48 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so that's 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 times. But wait, the last range is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Let's see, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds digit, so that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it's 488, so the last number is 488. Let me calculate how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let me check each range. - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, that seems correct. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Therefore, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: Units: 4,14,...,484: 48 numbers. Tens: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449: 5 ranges \u00d710 =50. Hundreds: 400-488: 89 numbers. Total 48+50+89=187. For 8's: Units: 8,18,...,488: 49 numbers. Tens: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Hundreds: 0. Total 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89.

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, it's 48 times. But wait, let me check: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The last one is 484, which is the 48th occurrence because 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4. Wait, actually, 484 is 48*10 + 4, so yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 ranges. Each has 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 times. Wait, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up the number of 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's printed. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but wait, 488 is included, which is 488, so that's the 48th group plus one more. Wait, no: 8, 18, ..., 488. The first one is 8, then every 10. So, how many terms? The last term is 488, which is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. Let's solve for n: 8 + 10(n-1) = 488 \u2192 10(n-1) = 480 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, because 488 is the last page. Let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but let me think: 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, total 10*4 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's printed. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's.

To find how many there are, I can calculate (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but does 484 count as the 49th? Let me check: 4 is the 1st, 14 is the 2nd, ..., 484 would be the 49th. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. Then 100-199: 140-149. 200-299: 240-249. 300-399: 340-349. 400-488: 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another range. So that's 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count how many such ranges. From 0-99: 80-89 is one. 100-199: 180-189. 200-299: 280-289. 300-399: 380-389. 400-488: Now, does 480-489 fall within 400-488? 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, the last number is 488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Wait, 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers, not 10. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears in 4 ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, that's 5 ranges, but the last one has only 9 numbers instead of 10. So, total for tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait a second. When counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, but actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers because it's from 480 to 488 inclusive. So, 488-480+1=9. So, that part is correct. So, total 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. So, yes, 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit):** Every 10 numbers, starting from 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. \n     - Number of 4's = (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit):** Ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n     - There are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 numbers.\n     - Number of 4's = 5 * 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit):** Numbers from 400 to 488.\n     - Number of 4's = 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** Every 10 numbers, starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488.\n     - Number of 8's = (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** Ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n     - There are 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 10 each, and the partial range 480-488 contributing 9 numbers.\n     - Number of 8's = (4 * 10) + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No page numbers from 800-899 exist, so 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 times more than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete groups of 10, which is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, so 48 times. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so actually, there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. However, the last group is from 481 to 488, which includes 484 as the 4 in the units place. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 1 to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488). So, the tens digit is 4 in the blocks 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times. But wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. Therefore, the total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. The last group is 481-488, which includes 488, so that's 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers. So, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, 480-488: the tens digit here is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, let's see: from 1-99, 80-89 is one block (10 numbers). From 100-199, 180-189 is another block (10). From 200-299, 280-289 is another (10). From 300-399, 380-389 is another (10). From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total blocks: 4 full blocks (each 10) and one partial block (9). So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 49 + 0 = 97. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 97 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

    "text": " The first 4 is at 4 and the last one within 488 would be 484. To find how many, I can calculate (484 - 4)/10 + 1. That is (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count how many sets of ten there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, and so on up to 440-449. How many such sets are there? Let's see, starting from 40-49 (which is 4*10), then 140-149 (14*10), 240-249 (24*10), 340-349 (34*10), and 440-449 (44*10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? So 440, 441, ..., 449. That's correct. So, 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. So, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 4's. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in numbers ending with 8, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, does 488 end with 8? Yes, 488 is included. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but 480-489: since the book only goes up to 488, we'll have 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, let's count each set: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 8's. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: Units: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total 188. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check that again. The hundreds place for 4's is from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For the tens place of 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 numbers. Correct. Units place for 4's: from 4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's, units: 8,18,...,488: 49 numbers. Tens: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Wait, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Well, the first one is 4 and the last one is 484. To find how many there are, I can calculate (484 - 4)/10 + 1. That would be (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times the digit 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set would be 440-449 because 480-489 would go beyond 488. Let me calculate how many sets of 100 there are. From 1-488, there are four hundreds: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, actually, 400-488 is part of the fourth hundred. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, for each hundred, that's 10 numbers. Now, how many hundreds are there? From 0-488, it's five hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so does that affect the count? Let me think. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers, and similarly in 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, that's five sets, each contributing 10 numbers, but wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, actually, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, except maybe the last one if it's cut off, but in this case, it's not because 449 is less than 488. So, how many hundreds? Let me count the hundreds where the tens digit can be 4. From 1-99: 40-49 is one set. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So that's five sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50. Wait, but wait, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's correct. So, 50 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds digit, so that's 89 occurrences. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in units place is 488. Let me calculate how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times the digit 8 appears in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, let's see:\n\n- From 1-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers.\n- From 100-199: 180-189 is 10 numbers.\n- From 200-299: 280-289 is 10 numbers.\n- From 300-399: 380-389 is 10 numbers.\n- From 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page).\n\nSo, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times the digit 8 appears in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nAdding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, for the tens place of 4's, I thought there were 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. But let me recount:\n\n- 40-49: 10\n- 140-149: 10\n- 240-249: 10\n- 340-349: 10\n- 440-449: 10\n\nThat's 5 sets, each 10 numbers, so 50. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's in the tens place, I had:\n\n- 80-89: 10\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9\n\nSo, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 49, which is correct because from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers.\n\nUnits place for 8's: 49, same logic.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 89, because from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers.\n\nHundreds place for 8's: 0, correct.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting in the hundreds place, maybe I overcounted. Let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place in 8's, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, 49 total in tens place for 8's.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? Let's see, the first number is 4, then every 10 after that. So, 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. To find how many there are, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48.8, but since we're dealing with whole numbers, there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. Wait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that means there are 48 full tens, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). But since 484 is the last number with a 4 in the units place before 488, that's 48 times. Hmm, but wait, 488 is included, but 488 has an 8 in the units place, not a 4. So, actually, the number of 4's in the units place is 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, the last range is 440-449, which is within 400-488, so that's fine. So, 50 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 more 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing an 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so does that add an extra 8? Let me check: 8, 18, ..., 488. So, starting at 8, each 10 numbers. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Wait, that's different from before. Because 488 is included, so the last term is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, the count is 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, right? Because 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, let's count each range: From 1-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is another 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is another 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is another 10. From 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, that's 4 ranges with 10 numbers each, and one range with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with an 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Number of such numbers:  \n     \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\)  \n     However, since 484 is included, we have 48 instances.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   - Number of ranges: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449)  \n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, so:  \n     \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\)\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.  \n   - Number of such numbers:  \n     \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\)\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\( 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 \\)\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Number of such numbers:  \n     \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\)  \n     (Including 488)\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   - Number of ranges with 10 numbers: 4 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389)  \n   - Number of numbers in the last range (480-488): 9  \n   - Total:  \n     \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\)\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\)\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 187 - 98 = 89\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " The first 4 is at 4, and the last one before 488 would be 484. To find how many there are, I can calculate (484 - 4)/10 + 1. Let me compute that: (484 - 4) is 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This would be numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these sets has 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 occurrences. Let me count how many such sets there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one set. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 occurrences. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can also be 4. That would be numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? Let's see, from 400 to 488 inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place would be 488. Let me calculate how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1. That's (480)/10 = 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me check if 480-489 is within the book. Since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of the book. So, 480-488 is another set. Let's count how many sets there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is one set. From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: 480-488. That's 5 sets. Each set contributes 10 numbers, except the last one, which is only 9 numbers (from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, let me check: 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, the first four sets each have 10 numbers, and the last set has 9. So, the total number of 8's in the tens place is 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me confirm. The first set (80-89) is 10 numbers, same for 180-189, etc., but the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, the total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - Numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Calculation: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Sets: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 numbers, totaling 5 sets.\n   - Calculation: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Numbers: 400-488.\n   - Calculation: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - Numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Calculation: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Sets: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four sets each have 10 numbers; the last set has 9.\n   - Calculation: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but actually, each group of 10 contributes exactly one 4 in the units place, except maybe the last group if it doesn't complete. Let me check: the last page is 488, so the last group is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the units digit 4 would appear in 484, which is within this group. So, yes, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place can also have a 4. These numbers would be 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the possible hundreds are 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488). So, for each hundred, there's a range where the tens digit is 4. That's 5 ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, the last range is 440-449, which is entirely within 400-488, so all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can also be 4. That would be from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Wait, but each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. But wait, when considering the hundreds place, each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, there are 187 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the units digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8. Wait, but 488 is included, which ends with 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? It's the same as the number of times 8 appears in the units place, which is the floor division of 488 by 10, which is 48, plus 1 if the last number is 488. Wait, 488 is 480 + 8, so 488 is included. So, the number of 8's in the units place is 49. Wait, but earlier for 4's, I thought it was 48, but now for 8's, it's 49. Wait, let me think again. The first 8 is at 8, then every 10 numbers: 18, 28, ..., 488. So, how many terms? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8. These numbers are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many ranges there are. Each hundred has a range where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 5 ranges. For each of the first four ranges (80-89, etc.), there are 10 numbers, contributing 10 each. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4 ranges \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. That would be from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nWait, let me go through the 4's again. Units place: 48 times. Tens place: 50 times. Hundreds place: 89 times. Total 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems right.\n\nFor the 8's: Units place: 49 times. Tens place: 49 times. Hundreds place: 0. Total 8's: 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was calculating the units place for 4's, I thought it was 48, but for 8's, it was 49. Let me confirm that again. For 4's in units place: from 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. How many terms? The last term is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that's 49 terms, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there.\n\nWait, let me recast this. The number of times a digit appears in the units place can be calculated as floor((max_page + 1 - digit)/10). So, for 4's: floor((488 + 1 - 4)/10) = floor(485/10) = 48.5, which is 48. So, 48 times. Similarly, for 8's: floor((488 + 1 - 8)/10) = floor(481/10) = 48.1, which is 48. But wait, that contradicts my earlier count where I thought 8's in units place were 49. Wait, maybe I should use a different formula.\n\nAlternatively, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is equal to (N // 10) + 1 if the units digit of N is >= d, else (N // 10). Wait, let me test this.\n\nFor 4's in units place: N = 488. N // 10 = 48. The units digit of N is 8, which is >= 4, so number of 4's in units place is 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me check with specific examples.\n\nTake N = 488. The units digits go from 0 to 9 in each ten. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete tens plus one if the last digit is >=4. So, 488 // 10 = 48, and since 8 >=4, we add 1, making it 49. So, 49 times. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. So, I must have made a mistake earlier. So, for 4's in units place, it's 49, not 48.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: N=488. 488 //10 =48, and since 8 >=8, we add 1, making it 49. So, both 4 and 8 in units place appear 49 times. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier calculation where 4's units place was 48 and 8's was 49. So, I think I made a mistake earlier, and the correct count for 4's in units place is 49.\n\nLet me recalculate the total number of 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49\n\nTens place: 50 (as before)\n\nHundreds place: 89\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's in units place was 48, but now it's 49. So, that changes the total.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49\n\nTens place: 49\n\nHundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nSo, now, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that's different from my initial calculation. So, I must have made a mistake in the units place for 4's earlier.\n\nLet me double-check using another method. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is equal to (N // 10) + 1 if the units digit of N is >= d, else (N // 10). So, for 4's:\n\nN=488, units digit=8, which is >=4, so number of 4's in units place is 488//10 +1 =48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: same calculation, 48 +1=49.\n\nSo, earlier, I thought 4's in units place was 48, but it's actually 49. So, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but now I'm getting 90 as the difference, whereas earlier I thought it was 89. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial count. Let me see where I went wrong.\n\nIn the initial count, I thought 4's in units place was 48, but now it's 49. So, that's an increase of 1, making the total 4's 188 instead of 187. So, the difference increases by 1, making it 90 instead of 89.\n\nWait, but let me check again. When N=488, the last number ending with 4 is 484, which is 484. So, how many numbers ending with 4 are there?\n\nStarting from 4, every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484.\n\nThe number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 numbers. So, 49 times 4 appears in units place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: 8,18,28,...,488. The last term is 488, which is included. So, number of terms is ((488-8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times.\n\nSo, that's correct. So, the initial mistake was in the count for 4's in units place; it's actually 49, not 48. So, the total 4's are 49+50+89=188.\n\n8's are 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. For 4's in tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each hundred has one such range, so from 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers), 100-199:140-149 (10), 200-299:240-249 (10), 300-399:340-349 (10), and 400-488:440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, total ranges:5, each contributing 10, so 5\u00d710=50. So, that's correct.\n\nFor 8's in tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, first four ranges have 10 each, last range has 9. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 times.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer was 89, but now it's 90. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial count.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recount the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought it was 89. Let me check with a different approach.\n\nAlternative approach: Instead of counting each digit place separately, maybe I can write a small program or use a formula to calculate the number of times each digit appears.\n\nBut since I can't write a program here, let me try another method.\n\nFor each digit position, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place: floor(488/10) + (1 if 488%10 >=4 else 0) =48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in units place: floor(488/10) + (1 if 488%10 >=8 else 0)=48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of 4's in tens place: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9. The number of times 4 appears in the tens place is calculated as follows:\n\nFor each hundred (0-99,100-199,...,400-488), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers in each hundred, except the last hundred if it's incomplete.\n\nFrom 0-99: 40-49:10 numbers.\n\nFrom 100-199:140-149:10.\n\nFrom 200-299:240-249:10.\n\nFrom 300-399:340-349:10.\n\nFrom 400-488:440-449:10.\n\nSo, 5 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 50.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in tens place:\n\nFrom 0-99:80-89:10.\n\nFrom 100-199:180-189:10.\n\nFrom 200-299:280-289:10.\n\nFrom 300-399:380-389:10.\n\nFrom 400-488:480-488:9.\n\nSo, 4\u00d710=40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: from 400-488:89 numbers.\n\nNumber of 8's: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, so the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89, but now it's 90. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial count of 4's in units place. It's actually 49, not 48. So, the correct difference is 90.\n\nI think that's the accurate count now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n   - **Tens Place:** '4' appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** '4' appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '8' appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n   - **Tens Place:** '8' appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** '8' does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of '8's from the total number of '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the same as how many times 4 is in the ones digit. To calculate this, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives me 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that means 48 full groups, each contributing one 4. But actually, 488 is the last page, so the units digit 4 occurs in 4, 14, ..., 484. Let me see: starting at 4, each subsequent 4 is 10 pages later. So, the number of 4's in the units place is floor(488 / 10) = 48 times. Wait, but 488 is included, so let me check: 488 / 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set would be 440-449. Let me count how many such sets there are. Each set has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so yes, all those are included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place is where the number is 400-488. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. Therefore, the total number of 4's is the sum of units, tens, and hundreds places: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187. Wait, let me check that again. Units: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. 48+50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. Okay, so 187 4's. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is included. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? From 1 to 488, the number of 8's in units place is floor(488 / 10) = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing an 8. But wait, 488 is included, so the last 8 in units place is 488. So, the number of 8's in units place is 48 +1? Wait, no, because 488 is the 48th group. Wait, let me think again. The first 8 is at 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. So, how many terms are there? The sequence is 8, 18, 28,..., 488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. We need the nth term to be \u2264488. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264488 \u2192 (n-1)*10 \u2264480 \u2192 n-1 \u226448 \u2192 n \u226449. So, there are 49 terms. Wait, so that means 49 8's in the units place. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. So, the number of such numbers is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8. This occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, let's count how many such sets there are. Each set has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, how many sets? 4 full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 numbers, and the last set 480-488 contributing 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can only be 1,2,3, or 4. So, 8 in the hundreds place doesn't occur because 800 is beyond 488. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought 4's were 187 and 8's are 98, so the difference would be 187-98=89. But let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recount the 8's. Units place: 8,18,...,488. As calculated, 49 times. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 in tens place. So, total 8's:49+49=98. Now, the 4's were 187, so the difference is 187-98=89. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. Let me check again. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Then, units place:48, tens place:50. 48+50=98, plus 89=187. That's correct. So, 187 4's and 98 8's. Therefore, 187-98=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of such numbers: \u230a488 / 10\u230b = 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such sets.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of such numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of such numbers: \u230a(488 - 8) / 10\u230b + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? It's the same as the number of times 4 appears in the units place. Since every 10 numbers have exactly one 4 in the units place, I can calculate how many sets of 10 are there in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 488 include a 4 in the units place? Let me check: 488 ends with 8, so the last number ending with 4 is 484. So, from 4 to 484, that's 48 numbers (since 484 is the 48th such number). So, 48 times 4 appears in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does that affect anything? No, because 484 is the last number ending with 4. So, units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. How many such sets are there? Each set of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many full hundreds are there? There's 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, in each of the first four centuries (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), there are 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Now, in the last set, 400-488, how many numbers have 4 in the tens place? From 400-488, the tens digit is 0 in 400-409, 1 in 410-419, ..., up to 8 in 480-488. So, the tens digit 4 would be in 440-449. That's 10 numbers: 440-449. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 449 exist? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, in the last set, we have another 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. So total tens place 4's: 4*10 + 10 = 50. Wait, but let me check: from 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, yes, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, actually, in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499. But since our book ends at 488, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, let me add up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, does 488 end with 8? Yes, 488 is the last page, so it's included. So, how many such numbers? Let's calculate: the first number is 8, the last is 488. The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms can be calculated as follows: The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488. Solving for n: 10(n-1) = 480 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, there are 49 numbers ending with 8. Wait, let me check: 8 is the first, 18 is the second, ..., 488 is the 49th. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 can appear in the tens place, like 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many full sets of 100 are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. In each of the first four centuries, there's a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Now, in the last set, 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8, so 480-488: how many numbers? 488-480+1=9 numbers. So, in the last set, we have 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Therefore, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. Wait, let me confirm: from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, let's add up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's)=89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " Well, starting from 4 and adding 10 each time, the last one before 488 would be 484. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The formula is ((last - first) / difference) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place, the 4 can appear in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count how many sets of ten there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) would have one such set. Wait, but 400-449 would be another set, and then 450-488 doesn't have a 4 in the tens place. So, how many sets? From 40-49: 1 set, then 140-149: another set, 240-249: another, 340-349: another, and 440-449: another. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, the last set is 440-449, but the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, there are 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many such numbers? Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups and a partial group. Each complete group contributes one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, in the 480-488 range, the units digit goes from 0 to 8. So, 484 is within this range, which is the 49th occurrence. So, total units place 4's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can also appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 fall within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's five ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's correct. So, total tens place 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place, which would be all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8 can appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups and a partial group. Each group contributes one 8 in the units place, so 48. Then, in the partial group (480-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included. So, that's 49 occurrences. So, units place 8's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, and the tens digit is 8. So, let's count these ranges. From 0-99: 80-89 is one range (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, in the hundreds place, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, how many 8's in the tens place? Let's calculate. For the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each has 10 numbers, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but there are only 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 9 more. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 8's. Let me check again. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189, another 10. 200-299: 280-289, 10. 300-399: 380-389, 10. 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That seems correct. For 4's in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, 488-400+1=89, yes. So, that's correct. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting, I might have missed something. Let me try another approach for verification. Alternatively, I can count the number of 4's and 8's digit by digit for each position. Let's start with the units digit: For 4's: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? It's floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 has a units digit of 8, the last 4 is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 4's in units place. Similarly, for 8's: units digit 8 occurs every 10 numbers, so floor(488/10)=48, but 488 is included, so 49 occurrences. So, units digits: 49 each. Now, tens digit: For 4's, the tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each hundred has one such decade. From 0-99: 10 numbers (40-49). From 100-199: 10 (140-149). From 200-299: 10 (240-249). From 300-399: 10 (340-349). From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 decades, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. For 8's, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, as before. So, 4 full decades (80-89, etc.) each with 10, so 4*10=40, plus 9 in 480-488, so 49. So, 49 8's in tens place. Now, hundreds digit: For 4's, from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. For 8's, there are no numbers between 800-899, so 0. So, adding up: 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the number of times the digits 4 and 8 appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** Every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, there are 49 such numbers (4, 14, ..., 484).\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400 to 488, there are 89 numbers with 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears 49 times in the units place (8, 18, ..., 488).\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full decades contributing 40, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No numbers have 8 in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, how many times does the units digit cycle through 0-9? It's 488 divided by 10, which is 48 full cycles, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). Each cycle contributes one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times, and in the extra 8 numbers, 484 is one of them, so that's one more. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, is that right? Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48, and then in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 484 is the only one ending with 4. So yes, 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. So, numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. How many such blocks are there? Well, each hundred has one block of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 0-99, 40-49 is one block (10 numbers). Then 100-199, 140-149 is another (10 numbers). Similarly, 200-299, 240-249; 300-399, 340-349; and 400-488, 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is only 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, 440-449 is fully included. So, how many blocks? From 0-399, there are four blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each contributing 10 numbers. Then in 400-488, the block is 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So total blocks: 5, each with 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but 400-488: does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, that's correct. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This happens from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, so 48, and then in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 488 is one of them. So, 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. So, numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let's check: 80-89 is 10 numbers. Then 180-189, another 10. 280-289, another 10. 380-389, another 10. And then 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, because 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9. So, total for tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. There's no page number with hundreds digit 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, when I was counting the tens place for 8's, I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, but actually, 480 is the start, and 488 is the end. So, from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, 9 numbers, which is correct. So, 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, etc.) plus 9, so 49. That seems right. So, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full cycles of 10, contributing 48 fours. The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 484, adding 1 more. Total: 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks (0-399 and 400-488), each contributing 10 fours.

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the number of 4's in the units place is equal to how many complete sets of 10 there are. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the last set would be 480-488, which includes 484. So, 48 complete sets, each with a 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.), there's a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many hundreds do we have? 488 is less than 500, so we have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. Wait, but in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times. So that's 4 times 10, which is 40. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, how many numbers have 4 in the tens place? That would be 440-449 and 450-459? Wait, no, 4 in the tens place would be 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But 488 is beyond 449, so 440-449 is included. So that's another 10. So total tens place 4's would be 4*10 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 401-488 is the fifth hundred, but actually, 401-500 would be the fifth hundred, but since we only go up to 488, we still have the 440-449 in that range, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is included, so the last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers ending with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many such ranges there are. Each hundred has one such range with 10 numbers. So, from 1-488, we have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 8's in the tens place. That's 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 numbers. Therefore, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of such numbers: \u230a488 / 10\u230b = 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences, and in the 401-488 range, another 10.\n   - Total: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of such numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of such numbers: \u2308488 / 10\u2309 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences, and in the 401-488 range, 9 more.\n   - Total: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Well, starting from 4 and adding 10 each time. The last number would be 484 because 484 + 10 is 494, which is beyond 488. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The formula for the number of terms is ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. Let me count how many sets of ten there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, right? 449 is less than 488, so that's okay. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? Let's see, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's. Wait, but I'm supposed to count how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place, which is once per number. So, 89 4's here. So, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 count? Yes, because the page numbers go up to 488. So, starting at 8, each step is +10. The last term is 488, but wait, 488 is 488, which is 488. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the last term is 48*10 + 8 = 488. So, how many terms? ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-489 would be 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? Wait, 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, let me adjust that. So, first, 80-89: 10 numbers. Then 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. And then 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: from 80-89: 10 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. Similarly for 180-189, etc. But for 480-488, it's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 8's in the tens place. So total tens place 8's: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place, but wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because 800-899 would be beyond 488. So, no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - Numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 4's in units place: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Sets: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 numbers, so 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Numbers: 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Each number contributes one 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's in units place: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Sets: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four sets contribute 10 each, totaling 40. The last set (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- More 4's than 8's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, let me check: starting from 4, every 10th number up to 484. Let me calculate it as (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, so 49 times in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, which is the 49th occurrence. Okay, so 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many numbers in each set: - 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. - 140-149: another 10. - 240-249: another 10. - 340-349: another 10. - 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449? Since 488 is the last page, 449 is within the range, so yes, all 5 sets are fully included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, let me add up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me calculate how many. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in sets like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, let's count: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98.

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one number ending with 4. So, how many blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, let me check if 488 itself ends with a 4. 488 ends with an 8, so the last number ending with 4 before 488 would be 484. So, from 4 to 484, that's 48 numbers. So, 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, actually, starting from 4, which is the first occurrence, then every 10 after that. So, the number of 4's in the units place is floor(488 / 10) = 48. Because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Wait, but let me check the last block: 440-449. Since the book goes up to 488, 449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so again, 48 full blocks. But wait, does 488 itself count? Yes, because 488 is within the range. So, the number of 8's in the units place is 49. Because from 8 to 488, the last 8 in the units place is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me check: starting at 8, which is the first occurrence, then every 10. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. Let's solve for n: 8 + 10(n-1) \u2264 488 \u2192 10(n-1) \u2264 480 \u2192 n-1 \u2264 48 \u2192 n \u2264 49. So, 49 occurrences. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. Let's count the blocks: From 0-99: 80-89 is one block. From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: 480-489, but 489 is beyond 488, so only 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so the tens digit is 8 for all these. So, that's another block, but only 9 numbers. So, total blocks: 4 full blocks (each with 10 numbers) and one partial block with 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, seems correct. But wait, let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, inclusive. 488-400+1=89. So, 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. For the tens place of 4's, I had 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each has 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. Correct. Units place for 4's: 48 numbers, as 488//10=48.8, so 48 full tens. But wait, does 488 include a 4 in the units place? No, because 488 ends with 8. So, the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is 48th occurrence. So, 48 is correct. For 8's: units place: 49 numbers, as 488 is included. Tens place: 4 full blocks (80-89, etc.) plus 480-488, which is 9 numbers, totaling 49. So, 49 in units and 49 in tens, total 98. So, the difference is 187-98=89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of such numbers: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Number of blocks: 5 (each contributing 10 numbers).\n   - Total: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of such numbers: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of such numbers: \\( \\left\\lceil \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rceil = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Full blocks: 4 (each contributing 10 numbers).\n   - Partial block (480-488): 9 numbers.\n   - Total: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:** \\( 187 - 98 = 89 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Let's see: The first number is 4, and the last number ending with 4 before 488 is 484. To find how many terms are in this sequence, I can use the formula: Number of terms = ((Last term - First term) / Common difference) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. Let's calculate how many numbers have 4 in the tens place. Each set of ten numbers (like 40-49) has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such sets are there? The first set is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, so 5 * 10 = 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, I'm only interested in the hundreds digit being 4, which it is for all these numbers. So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's. Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. From 400 to 488, how many numbers? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 ends with 8. Let's calculate how many numbers end with 8 from 1 to 488. The first is 8, the last is 488. The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms here can be calculated as ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 can appear in the tens place, such as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, each set of 10 numbers contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except the last one which only has 9. Let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9. So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 can appear in the hundreds place. But wait, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case. So, 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place. So, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers \u2192 0 times.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Well, from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? The first such number is 4, and the last is 484. To find how many there are, I can divide 484 by 10, which gives 48.4, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is the 49th number because we start counting from 1. So, 484 is the 49th occurrence. Let me check: 4, 14, 24,...,484. The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last term - first term)/common difference) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is okay, but 540-549 would be beyond 488, so we don't need to consider that. Let's count how many sets of ten there are where the tens digit is 4. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449: 440 is 440, 441,...,449, which is 10 numbers. So, 5 sets, each with 10, so 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28,..., up to 488. Wait, 488 ends with 8, so the last number is 488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the units place. Using the same formula as before: first term 8, last term 488, common difference 10. Number of terms = ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let's see: each set from x80 to x89 has 10 numbers, but the last set is only up to 488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but 480-489 would be 10, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9. So, how many full sets of 10 do we have? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 full sets (each 10) and one partial set with 9. So, total is 4*10 +9=40+9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the book.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - Numbers ending with 4: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Numbers with 4 in the tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 numbers, totaling 5 sets.\n   - Number of terms: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Numbers with 4 in the hundreds place: 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - Numbers ending with 8: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Numbers with 8 in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each full set contributes 10 numbers, with the last set contributing 9.\n   - Number of terms: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Well, starting from 4, every 10th number has a 4 in the units place. So, how many sets of 10 are there in 488? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. Each set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, the last set would be 480-488. So, 484 is within this range, so that's one more 4. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49? Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. The number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of times 4 appears in the ones place from 1 to 488. The pattern repeats every 10 numbers, so for each 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4, so that's 48. But then, in the incomplete group from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which adds one more 4. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, the last block is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400 to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit position. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. From 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48. Then, in the incomplete group from 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which adds one more 8. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is a partial block because 488 is less than 489. Let me count these blocks. From 1-99: 80-89 is one block, contributing 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 full blocks (each contributing 10) and one partial block with 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place 8's:49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's:0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.
