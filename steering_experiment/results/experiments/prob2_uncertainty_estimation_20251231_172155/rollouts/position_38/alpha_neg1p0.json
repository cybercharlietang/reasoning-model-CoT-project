    "text": " Again, I'll check each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. How many such numbers? If I take 488 and divide by 10, that's 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, let's check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, how many numbers? The formula is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 480-488. So, how many sets? Each set is 10 numbers, so 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Now, the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is within range, but 480-489 would be up to 488, which is the last page. Wait, so 480-488 also has 8 in the tens place. Let me count each block. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: how many? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place for 480-488. So total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So 10*4=40 plus 9 is 49.

But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last set. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10 because 489 is beyond 488). Wait, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488.

Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the tens place for eights again. When I considered the tens place, I had 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, the total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, starting at 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 is the last page. So, the last occurrence in the units place is 488. To find how many, divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's included. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count each block. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, the total number of eights is units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 98. Difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, maybe I should check the tens place for eights again. Wait, when counting the tens place for eights, I considered 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So that's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, which is 49. That seems correct. Similarly, for fours in the tens place, I had 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449, which is 5 sets of 10, totaling 50. That also seems correct. For hundreds place in fours, 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is correct. So, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the difference is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that's 49 numbers (since 8 is the first, then 18, 28, ..., 488). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Wait, so each of these blocks contributes 10 eights except maybe the last one. Let's see: 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 eights because 488 is the last page. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, which is 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That's correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the tens place for fours. Let me check again. For fours in the tens place, we have 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 5*10=50. That's correct. For eights in the tens place, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, which is 49. That's correct. So, the difference is indeed 90.

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count each set. Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last one, which might be cut short. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. So, now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, but wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place for eights. When counting the tens place for eights, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers (480-488). So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, which is 4*10 +9=49. So, that's correct. Similarly, for fours, the hundreds place goes up to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, that's correct too. So, the final answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again: when counting the units place for fours, I had 49 numbers. Similarly, for eights, units place is 49. But in the tens place, fours had 50 and eights had 49. And hundreds place for fours is 89, while for eights it's 0. So, 49+50+89=188, and 49+49+0=98. So, 188-98=90.

Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Yes, that's 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me verify the fours again. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) +1. So, (484)/10=48.4, floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: Units: same logic, 49. Tens: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set has 9 instead of 10. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Let me see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So yes, 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

Let me see: 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (including both endpoints). So, each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 eights in the tens place, and the last block (480-488) has 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The difference between each term is 10, so the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49.

Wait, 8,18,...,488. Let me check: 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, n=49.

Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10 are there? Let's calculate 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8.

But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, totaling 49 eights in the tens place.

For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yes, that looks correct.

    "text": " Again, I'll break it down by units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many such numbers are there? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers with 8 in the units place? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms can be calculated as follows: The first term is 8, which is 8 = 8 + (n-1)*10. The last term is 488, which is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. Solving for n: 8 + 10(n-1) = 488 \u2192 10(n-1) = 480 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Wait, so let me count how many full sets and the partial set. Each full set (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. There are four full sets: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each contributes 10 eights, so that's 4*10=40. Now, the next set is 480-489, but the book stops at 488, so how many numbers here have 8 in the tens place? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), each with 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 more eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights here. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought maybe 90, but let me double-check the calculations. Wait, did I make a mistake in counting the eights in the tens place? Let me recount the tens place eights. Each full set (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) is 10 each, so 4*10=40. Then, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so 40+9=49. That seems correct. So, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Fours: 188. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought maybe the hundreds place for fours was 89, but let me confirm that. From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Units place: 49 fours, tens place:50 fours. 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct. So, the difference is 90. But wait, I feel like I might have made a mistake in the units place for fours. Let me check again. Units place for fours: from 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The first term is 4, the last is 484. The sequence is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10*(n-1) = 480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 fours in the units place. That's correct. Similarly, for eights in units place: 8,18,...,488. That's 49 terms as calculated before. So, the counts seem accurate. Therefore, the number of fours is 188, eights is 98, so 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

The last occurrence is at 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 49 numbers (including 8 and 488). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8's in the tens place occur in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would also have 8's in the tens place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let me check how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, except maybe the last one. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10=40 and 9, so total 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers. Wait, let me just double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yep, that seems correct. I think I've got it right.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.

The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is within 488. Yes, up to 488. So, each block contributes 10 eights. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: how many? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place for the 480-488 range. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, etc.) which is 40, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49. Wait, no. Wait, let me recount. The blocks are 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 blocks of 10 (40) plus 9, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for eights. When I considered the tens place, I had 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10=40 plus 9=49. That's correct. For fours in the tens place, it's 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 blocks of 10, so 50. That's correct. And hundreds place for fours: 400-488:89 numbers. Correct.

That's 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, so 4 sets \u00d710=40. The last set, 480-488, contributes 9 eights.

The count is (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nFor the eights:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488. The count is (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks is 10 numbers, and the last block is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: none, since 800+ is beyond 488. So 0. Correct.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98. Correct.\n\nDifference:188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers (from 4 to 484 inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place in the range 400-488, which includes 89 numbers.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers (from 8 to 488 inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges each contribute 10 numbers, and the last range contributes 9 numbers, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

The last number is 488, so how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many tens places have 8. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, that's 480-488 inclusive, which is 9 numbers. So, total eights in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

Let me see how many that is. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the 49th number because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, let me count each block. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits with 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, 49+49 is 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Let me just quickly check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188.

The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 occurrences. Wait, 8,18,...,488: that's from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many full sets there are. Each full set (like 80-89) has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 40 eights. Now, check if there's a partial set beyond that. The next would be 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 more eights in the tens place. So total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me check again. Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) and one partial set of 9 (480-488), so 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 in tens place. So total eights: 49 +49=98. So, now, the number of fours is 188 and the number of eights is 98. To find how many more fours there are, subtract: 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. That's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers, correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each 10, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours. 49+50+89=188, correct. Now, eights: units place: 8,18,...,488: 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, which is 4*10 +9=49. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again. When counting the tens place for fours, I included 440-449, which is correct because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 sets, each 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. For eights, the tens place includes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place. So, yes, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90.

Let's see: each hundred block (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, not 10 because 489 is beyond 488). Wait, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is the first, then 481,..., up to 488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, the tens place in the hundreds block: 480-488 gives 9 eights, not 10. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488.

The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. So, 188 -98=90. Hmm, but let me check the tens place for eights again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10 +9=49. That's correct. Units place: 49, correct because 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. So, 49+49=98. For fours, units:49, tens:50 (because 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets of 10, which is 50), and hundreds:400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I feel like maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check: from 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place. And in the tens place for fours, it's 5 sets of 10, so 50. Units place:49. So, 188 fours. Eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, so 98. So, 188-98=90.
