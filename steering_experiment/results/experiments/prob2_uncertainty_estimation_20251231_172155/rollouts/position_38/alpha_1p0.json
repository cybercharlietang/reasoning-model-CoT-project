    "text": " Maybe I should do the same approach, checking each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, which is in the units place. So, starting from 8, every 10 numbers. How many terms? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, 8,18,28,...,488. So, 488 is the 49th term. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let me count how many sets. Each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the book.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " I think it's similar, but maybe there are fewer 8's because 888 is way beyond 488, so the hundreds place might not have as many. Let me go through each digit place again. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The formula is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1 = 48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 fall within 488? 480-488 is within the book, so that's another set. So, how many sets? 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, the first four sets have 10 each, and the last set has 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Did I count correctly? For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98. Difference is 90. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences (no pages 800-899).\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Let me count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers.

The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers? Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th occurrence. Let me count: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. We want the last term to be \u2264488. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264488. Let's solve for n: (n-1)*10 \u2264480 \u2192 n-1 \u226448 \u2192 n \u226449. So, there are 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more fours are printed than eights. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours -98 eights =90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

    "text": " I'll go through each digit place as well: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 count? Yes, because it's page 488. So, how many 8's in the units place? Let's see, starting from 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. To find how many terms, we can consider that the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. The number of 8's in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 48*10=480, so 480 is the last page with an 8 in the units place before 488. So, does 488 add another 8 in the units place? Yes, because 488 is page 488, so the units digit is 8. So, that's 48 +1=49 8's in the units place. Wait, no, because 488 is included, so from 8 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. The number of terms is floor(488/10) +1 if 488 mod 10 is 8. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is the case, so the number of 8's in the units place is 48 +1=49. Wait, but earlier for 4's, I had 49 in the units place. So, same here, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let me count how many sets of 100 have 8 in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: let's see, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 -480 +1=9. So, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 8's. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=49+49=98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through the 4's again: units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 4's:188. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 8's:98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place, correct. For tens place in 4's: each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 4, so 40-49, 140-149, etc. Up to 440-449. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. So, 49 in units, 50 in tens, 89 in hundreds: 188. For 8's: units place:8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers, as 488 is included. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four contributes 10, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting digits, especially in higher places, I might have missed something. Let me try another approach for verification. Alternatively, I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's digit by digit. Let's consider each digit position separately for 4's and 8's.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- **Units place:**\n  - Numbers: 4,14,24,...,484.\n  - Total: floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 ends with 8, the last 4 in units is 484, which is 48*10 +4=484. So, 48+1=49.\n\n- **Tens place:**\n  - Each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 4. So, 40-49,140-149, etc.\n  - From 1-488, how many hundreds? 488/100=4.88, so 5 hundreds (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488).\n  - In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, 5*10=50, but wait, in the last hundred (400-488), the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 5*10=50.\n\n- **Hundreds place:**\n  - Hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- **Units place:**\n  - Numbers:8,18,28,...,488.\n  - Total: floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 ends with 8, it's 48+1=49.\n\n- **Tens place:**\n  - Tens digit is 8 in 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488.\n  - Each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40.\n  - The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive).\n  - Total:40+9=49.\n\n- **Hundreds place:**\n  - No numbers in 1-488 have hundreds digit 8.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nThus, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 488 is included in units and tens, so that's correct. So, the difference is 90. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Because 480 to 489 would be 10, but the book ends at 488, so it's 9 numbers. Let me confirm: from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9.

Correct. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For the tens place in eights, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers. Let me check: 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, right? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers because 488-480=8, but you have to add 1, so 9. So, yes, that's correct. And for the fours in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is correct because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in hundreds place.

So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, let me think: from 0 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? It's floor(488/10) + 1 if 488 mod 10 is 8 or more. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, but since 488 ends with 8, we add 1, making it 49.

So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Wait, that's 98 eights. Wait, but earlier I thought 49 in units and 49 in tens, so 98 total. Hmm, but let me double-check. Units: 49, tens:49, so 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's, so 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through the 4's again: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for eights. Let me recount that. For the tens place, the eights are in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 40+9=49. That's correct. So, the tens place eights are 49. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is indeed 90.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each block of 100 has 10 eights in the tens place except the last block, which has only 9. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, then 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40 plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens:49, so total 98. Hmm, that seems right. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. Let me go through each digit place again for both digits. For fours: units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many numbers? The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) +1. So, (488-4)=484, 484/10=48.4, floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. Tens place: in each hundred, 10 numbers, so from 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. How many? 488-8=480, 480/10=48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So, 49+49=98. Thus, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in page numbers from 1 to 488 is calculated by examining each digit place (units, tens, and hundreds). Similarly, the number of times the digit 8 appears is counted. \n\n1. **Counting 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 4, 14, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 8, 18, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** None \u2192 0 occurrences.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nThe difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, last is 488. So, from 8 to 488 with step 10. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full steps, but starting at 8, so the number of terms is 49? Wait, no. Wait, 8 is the first term, then 18, 28,...,488. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets we have. Each set is 10 numbers, except maybe the last one. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me check that again. Units:49, tens:49, so total 98. That seems correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each part again. For fours: units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449: that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Hundreds place:400-488: 89 numbers. Total fours:49+50+89=188. For eights: units place:8,18,...,488:49 numbers. Tens place:80-89,180-189,...,480-488: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Hundreds place:0. So, total eights:49+49=98. Difference:188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.

    "text": " I might have made a mistake earlier, so I need to be careful here. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but wait, 488 is included. So, starting from 8, the last number would be 488. So, how many numbers? Let me think: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is given by ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8. Each of these blocks contributes 10 eights except the last one, which is only 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book stops at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many eights in the tens place? Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, right? So, yes, 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total eights:98. Now, the number of fours was 188, and eights were 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the eights, especially in the tens place. Let me recount the tens place eights. Each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one if it's cut short. So, from 1-488, how many full hundreds are there? 4 hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, actually, 488 is in the 400-488 range, which is part of the 400-499 block, but we only go up to 488. So, in the tens place, each hundred block (except the last partial one) contributes 10 eights. So, 0-99: 80-89:10 eights. 100-199:180-189:10 eights. 200-299:280-289:10 eights. 300-399:380-389:10 eights. 400-488:480-488:9 eights. So, that's 4 full hundreds with 10 eights each, and the last partial hundred with 9 eights. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49)=98. So, fours:188, eights:98. Difference:188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the hundreds place for eights would be zero, which it is. So, yes, I think that's correct. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using a formula for each digit position. For the units digit, the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to n can be calculated using a formula, but since I'm doing this manually, maybe I can stick with my earlier method. Alternatively, I can think of each digit position separately and calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in each. Let me try that for fours again. Units place: For each block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then in the incomplete block (481-488), there's a 4 in 484. So, 48*1 +1=49 fours in the units place. Tens place: For each block of 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. How many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? 4 blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. Wait, actually, 488 is in the fifth block, but it's incomplete. So, in each complete block (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), there are 10 fours in the tens place. That's 4*10=40. Now, in the incomplete block (401-488), how many fours in the tens place? The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, so that's another 10 fours. So, total tens place fours:40+10=50. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, that's 89 numbers (488-400+1=89), each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Now for eights: Units place: Each block of 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, that's 48 full blocks (1-10, 11-20,...,481-490), but wait, 488 is less than 490, so the last block is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in each full block of 10, we have one 8, and in the last partial block, 481-488, we have 8 in 488. So, the number of 8s in the units place is 48 (from the full blocks) +1 (from 488)=49. Tens place: Each block of 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 8, which is 10 numbers. So, from 1-100:80-89:10 eights. 101-200:180-189:10 eights. 201-300:280-289:10 eights. 301-400:380-389:10 eights. 401-488:480-488:9 eights (since 480-489 would be 10, but we stop at 488). So, that's 4*10=40 from the first four blocks, plus 9 from the last partial block, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Hundreds place: As before, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place, so 0. Total eights:49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. I think that's correct. So, the number of fours printed is 90 more than the number of eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Number of occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each full block contributes 10 occurrences, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Number of occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe it's a bit trickier because 8 can appear in the units, tens, or hundreds place, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can't be 8. So, only units and tens places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so does it include 488? Let me see: 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, starting from 8, every 10 numbers up to 488. How many such numbers are there? Let's compute: The first is 8, the last is 488. The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. To find how many terms there are, we can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)*d. Here, a_n=488, a_1=8, d=10. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10 => 480 = (n-1)*10 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8's in the tens place occur in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-489 would be another set, but 488 is the last page. So, 480-488 is part of that set. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480 to 488 is 9 numbers because 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9. So, in the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** As I thought earlier, the hundreds digit can't be 8 because the book only goes up to 488, so no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Wait, that seems correct. Let me add them up again: units 49, tens 49, so 49+49=98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my counts for both digits to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units place 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. Seems right. For 8's: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. That seems correct.

    "text": " Maybe I'm overcomplicating it, but I think it's similar. I'll check each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which would give 48 eights, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8*50=400, but 488 is 48*10 +8, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets do we have? Each full set (like 80-89) has 10 numbers, so 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place for eights, I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, but actually, from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, yes, that's correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, total 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed. Wait, but let me think again: when counting the units place for fours, I had 49, and for eights, also 49. But in the tens place, fours had 50, while eights had 49. And hundreds place for fours had 89, while for eights it was 0. So, the difference comes from tens and hundreds places. Let me see: fours have 50 in tens, eights have 49, so that's a difference of +1. Hundreds place: fours have 89, eights have 0, so that's +89. So, total difference is 1+89=90. Yep, that's consistent. So, I think the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No 8's as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, 480-489 would be another set, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Let's count how many full sets we have: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, for the last partial set: 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488).

So, yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see, how many sets are there? Each hundred has one set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 40 eights in the tens place. But wait, 488 is within 400-488, so does 480-489 exist? Wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the page numbers. But the tens digit in 480-489 is 8, but since the book only goes up to 488, the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but earlier I thought the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book stops at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 480-488 is part of the hundreds digit being 4, and the tens digit being 8. So, in the tens place, 8 occurs in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, so that's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, for the tens place, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Hmm, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, total tens place eights are 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that's 98 eights. But earlier, I thought units place had 49 and tens had 49, so total 98. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Units place: 8,18,...,488: 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. So, total eights:98. Now, the number of fours was 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 -98 =90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the tens place for eights. Let me recount the tens place for eights. From 80-89:10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, total eights:98. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - There are 49 such numbers (from 0 to 484, inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.  \n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks.  \n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.  \n   - There are 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - There are 49 such numbers.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9 (since the book ends at 488).  \n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = **49**.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book only goes up to 488.  \n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

Units place: 49, tens:49, so total eights are 98. Hmm, but I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place for that set, right? So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, units place has 49, tens has 49, so total eights are 98. Okay, that seems correct.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 exist? The book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, how many sets? Each 100 has one set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 eights in the tens place, and the last set (480-488) has 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yep, that's correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems high. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting fours. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. That's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers, correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, and there are 5 blocks (40-49 is the first, then 140-149, etc.), so 5*10=50, correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. For eights, units place: 8,18,...,488: 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-488. So, 4 full sets of 10 (4*10=40) and 9 in the last set, totaling 49.

So, 8 can only be in the units or tens place. Let's go through each place:\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 ends with 8, so that's included. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would be the next, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488.

From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 in all these, so 9 eights.\n\nSo, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me add again: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) gives 40, and then 480-488 gives 9, so 40+9=49. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any. For units place, 49 eights, and for tens place, 49 eights, so total 98 eights.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. For example, 80-89: 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189: another 10, etc. So, 4 blocks of 10, which is 40, plus 480-488: 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49 in the tens place. So, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When counting eights in the tens place, does 480-488 count as 9 eights? Because each number from 480 to 488 has an 8 in the tens place, right? So, that's 9 eights. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier when counting fours, I had 188 fours. So, the difference would be 188 fours minus 98 eights, which is 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me recount the fours again to be sure.\n\nFours:\n\n- Units place: 49 fours. That's from 4,14,24,...,484. Since 484 is 4*121, so 121 numbers? Wait, no, because every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's the number of times 4 appears in 1-488 in the units digit. So, it's floor(488/10) + 1 if 488 ends with 4. Wait, 488 ends with 8, so it's floor(488/10) = 48, but since 48*10=480, and 480+4=484, which is within 488, so it's 48+1=49 fours. So, that's correct.\n\n- Tens place: 50 fours. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. That's correct.\n\nNow, eights:\n\n- Units place: 49 eights, as from 8,18,...,488. So, 488 is included, so 49 eights.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40 +9=49 eights.\n\nSo, total eights: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 fours minus 98 eights, which is 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check if I missed any numbers. For example, in the hundreds place, 488 is included, but does that affect the count? No, because 488's hundreds digit is 4, which we've already counted in the hundreds place. Similarly, in the tens place, 480-488 includes numbers where the tens digit is 8, which we've counted as 9.\n\nWait, but let me think about the hundreds place for eights. Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can't be 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, no eights in the hundreds place, which is correct.\n\nSo, yes, the counts seem accurate. Therefore, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98, so the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 5 blocks.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 89.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places separately. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. So, how many such numbers? The last one is 488, so dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also count? But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, right? 488 - 480 +1 =9). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9. So, the tens place for 8: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me think again: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10=40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, is that right? Units:49, tens:49, so 49+49=98. Hmm, but let me check again. Units: from 8,18,...,488: that's 49 numbers. Tens: from 80-89, etc., which is 49 as calculated. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me double-check the counts. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me think again. Maybe I overcounted the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. And in the tens place, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Units place: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so 484 is the last one, which is 484=48*10 +4, so 48 full tens, but including 484, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 fours in units. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49. So, 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me check again the tens place for eights. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, yes, 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For example, in the hundreds place for fours, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. And in the tens place, 440-449 is 10, so that's correct. Units place: correct as well. So, I think 90 is the right answer. Therefore, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Yes, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets are there?

So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. Correct. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) +1. So, (488-4)=484, 484/10=48.4, floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. For 4's in tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, and there are 5 blocks, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. For 8's: units place, same as 4's:49. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 blocks, but the last block only has 9 numbers. So, 4 blocks of 10 (40) and 1 block of 9, totaling 49. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90.

Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that's 49 occurrences, right? Because 488 is the last one, so 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last set. Let's count how many sets there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299:280-289 (10). 300-399:380-389 (10). 400-488:480-488. Wait, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens place has 10 (from 80-89) +10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check. Units: 49, tens:49, so 98 eights. Hmm, is that correct? Let me think about the tens place again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. The difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours. Let me recount the fours. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? 484 is the 49th term because (484-4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units:49. Tens place:40-49:10,140-149:10,240-249:10,340-349:10,440-449:10. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50. Hundreds place:400-488:89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. That's correct. Now, eights: units:49, tens:49, so 98. 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights. I think that's the answer. But let me check if I missed anything. Wait, in the hundreds place for fours, is it 89? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. Yes, because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Units and tens as above. Eights: units 49, tens 49. So, 98. So, difference is 90.

    "text": " Maybe I missed something earlier, but I think it's similar. I'll go through each digit position again: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is included, so does that make it 49? Let me see: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. 8,18,...,488. So, how many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is within 488, but 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place. Wait, 480-489 is within 488? No, because 488 is the last page. So, 480-488 would be part of the tens place being 8. Wait, but in the tens place, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which only goes up to 488, so that's 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480-488 is 9 numbers? Wait, 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 numbers, and the last block (480-488) has 9 numbers. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems right. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for eights. Let me check again. Tens place eights: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10=40 plus 9=49. That seems correct. Units place eights: from 8 to 488, every 10 numbers. As calculated, 49. So, total eights: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for fours was 89, but let me check that again. Hundreds place fours: numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, that's correct. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, yes, 188 fours and 98 eights. The difference is 90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488 (9 numbers).\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe the approach is similar, but I have to be careful because the book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit can only be 4, not higher. So, 8's can appear in units, tens, and hundreds places, but in the hundreds place, only if the number is 800 or higher, which doesn't exist here since the book is only 488 pages. So, 8's can only be in units and tens places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. How many such numbers? Let's see: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many terms there are. The first term is 8, which is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1 = 48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 480-489 would be 10, but we only go up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, so 49+49=98. That seems correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through the 4's again. Units place: from 4,14,...484. How many terms? (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct. Now for 8's: Units place:8,18,...488. That's (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, the last has 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " I think the approach is similar, but maybe there are fewer 8's, especially in the hundreds place since the book only goes up to 488. Let me go through each digit place again. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? The formula is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except maybe the last block. Let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers because 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, so units and tens each have 49, so 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Hmm, wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the units place for 4's. I thought it was 49, but let me check again. From 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. That's correct. For the tens place, 40-49,140-149, etc., each block has 10, and there are 5 blocks up to 440-449, which is correct, so 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. For eights, units place:8,18,...,488. That's ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=49. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10, and the last block has 9, so 4*10 +9=49. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.

Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 9 numbers: 480-488. So, instead of 10, it's 9. So, how many sets do we have? Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total eights in the tens place: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in each 100, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers.

Then, in the last partial hundred, 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.

Wait, because 8 is the first, then 18, 28,..., 488. So, 8 is the 1st, 18 is the 2nd, ..., 488 is the 49th. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is within 488, but 480-489 is beyond 488, so the last set is 380-389. Each set has 10 numbers, so how many sets?

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the units place for fours. I said 49 fours in the units place, but let me check: from 4, 14, 24,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, that's correct. Similarly, for the units place of eights: 8,18,...,488. (488 -8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, that's correct too. For the tens place, fours: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, so 5*10=50 fours. Eights in tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4 sets, so 4*10=40 eights. Hundreds place: fours are from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Eights in hundreds place: none, as the book ends at 488. So, total fours: 49 +50 +89=188. Total eights:49 +40 +0=89. Difference:188-89=99. So, I think that's correct.
