    "text": " I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, starting from 8, the last one is 488. How many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count each block: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). So total is 10*4 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

This totals 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would give 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers.

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks we have. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299:280-289 (10). 300-399:380-389 (10). 400-488:480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, we have 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9.

Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Let me recount the fours and eights. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49.

Wait, let me think differently. The first term is 4 (n=1), next is 14 (n=2), up to 484. So, the nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 4 + 10(n-1) = 484.

Let's see, the last number is 488, so the units digit 8 appears how many times? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms can be calculated as (488 - 8)/10 +1. That's (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488.

Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so that's correct. For the tens place, 4 in the tens digit occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That seems right. Units place for fours: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The last term is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, (484-4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. For eights: units place is 49, tens place is 49, so 98 total. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

The last one is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers. How many such blocks are there within 488? Let's see: 80-89: yes, 180-189: yes, 280-289: yes, 380-389: yes. The next would be 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of this block. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but for the tens place, each block is 10 numbers, so 480-489 would have 10 eights in the tens place. But since we only go up to 488, we have 9 eights in the tens place for that block. So, let's calculate: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would give 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the units digit 8 occurs at 8,18,28,...,488. Let me count how many times that is. From 0 to 488, how many multiples of 10 plus 8? So, 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Let's see how many full sets there are. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours -98 eights = 90.

Yes, 488 ends with an 8. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. To find how many, I can do (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last number, so 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, that's only 9 numbers because 480 is the first and 488 is the last, so 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 eights in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Units place:49, tens place:49, so total eights:49+49=98. Hmm, but wait, in the tens place, I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, which is 4*10 +9=49. So, yes, that's correct. So, total eights:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 -98=90. Wait, that's a big difference. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, so 98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. For eights, in the tens place, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. Units place for eights: from 8,18,...,488. That's (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit surprised it's that high. Let me see if I can think of another way to count. Alternatively, maybe I can count the number of times each digit appears in each position. For units digit: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear? Every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, which gives 48 fours, but then we have an extra 8 numbers (481-488), where the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, in the 49th cycle, the units digit is 4 at 484. So, total units fours:49. Similarly, for eights in units place: same logic, 49 times. For tens digit: in each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, from 1-400, that's 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, no, actually, 400-488 is part of the 400s. So, from 0-99: 10 fours in tens place (40-49). 100-199: 10 fours (140-149). 200-299:10 fours (240-249). 300-399:10 fours (340-349). 400-488: the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, totaling 50 fours. For eights in the tens place: similar logic. From 0-99: 10 eights in tens place (80-89). 100-199:10 eights (180-189). 200-299:10 eights (280-289). 300-399:10 eights (380-389). 400-488: eights in tens place are 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, that's 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. For hundreds place: fours are from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Eights in hundreds place: none, since the book only goes up to 488. So, adding up, fours:49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188. Eights:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems consistent. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, each of these blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 blocks, so 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 89. Wait, 49+40=89. So, total eights are 89. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 89 eights equals 99. Wait, 188-89=99. So, there are 99 more fours than eights. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 40, hundreds 0. Total 89. 188-89=99. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences (from 4 to 484 inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers (like 1-100, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8.

Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8, so each of those 9 numbers has an 8 in the tens place. So, adding up: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) gives 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, total of 49 eights in the tens place.

So, how many such numbers? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but does 488 count as the 49th? Let me list them: 8,18,28,...,488. The first is 8 (1st), then 18 (2nd), ..., 488 is the 49th. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8.

So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) -98 (eights)=90.

Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, the tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That's correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer should be 90. But wait, let me make sure I didn't overcount in the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, that's correct. And for eights, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 4 full decades (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49.

Let's see how many that is. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 occurrences. Wait, no, 8, 18, ..., 488. Let's see: 488 is the 49th number because from 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check each block. From 1-488, the blocks are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488. So, in each of these blocks, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, etc. Let's count how many full blocks there are. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-489 would be another block, but since the book only goes up to 488, the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place is only up to 488. So, 480-488 has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (480-488 is 9 numbers, since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, total in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yep, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, did I count the hundreds place correctly for fours? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems right because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. And for the tens place, 440-449 is included, which is 10 numbers, so 50 in total. Units place: 49, yes. For eights, units place: 49, tens place:49, correct. So, the difference is 90.

So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each full hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10.

Wait, but when I count from 8 to 488 in steps of 10, how many numbers is that? Let's see: The first is 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. The number of terms can be calculated as ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1 = 48+1=49. Wait, that's 49 numbers.

But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8.

Wait, no: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) each have 10, and the last block (480-488) has 9.

The units place for eights: starts at 8, then 18, 28,...,488. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (488 -8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So 4*10=40, +9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. So total eights:49+49=98. Fours:188. So, difference is 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly for the hundreds place in fours? The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. That's 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours. Correct. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. Let's see: 484 is 484, so how many terms? The last term is 484, which is 4 + 10*(n-1)=484. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 fours in units place. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Yep, that's correct. So, the difference is 188-98=90.

But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 would be the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place? Wait, no. Wait, 480-488 is in the hundreds place as 4, and the tens digit is 8. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's count each block: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9.

Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each set except the last has 10, the last has 9. So 4*10=40 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block from 80-89, 180-189, etc., has 10 numbers. There are four such blocks: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). Then, the last block is 480-488, which has 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that can't be right because I think I might have made a mistake in counting. Let me check again. Wait, when I counted the units place for 4's, I thought it was 49, but let me make sure. From 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The last term is 484, which is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, units place for 4's is 49, correct. Tens place for 4's: 40-49, 140-149, etc. Up to 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, tens place is 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, eights: units place is 49, correct. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, and the last block has 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. Wait, but I feel like I might have missed something. Let me check the hundreds place for eights again. Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can't be 8, so no eights there. So, that's correct. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, especially in the tens place, I might have made a mistake. Let me recount the eights in the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. So, yes, the difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it's 488. So, how many such numbers are there? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The formula for the number of terms is ((last - first)/step) + 1. So, ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit being 8. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, let me confirm: 480 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 10 (from 80-89) +10 (180-189)+10 (280-289)+10 (380-389)+9 (480-488) = 10+10+10+10+9=49.
