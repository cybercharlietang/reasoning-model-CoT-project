    "text": " The 8's don't have any in the hundreds place, so that's why the difference is so large. Let me see if I can think of another way to approach this. Maybe by considering each digit position separately for both 4 and 8 and adding them up. But I think I did that already. Alternatively, maybe I can write out a small example to test my method. For example, let's say the book has 20 pages. How many 4's and 8's would there be? Page numbers 1-20. Counting 4's: 4,14: units place (2), 40-49 would be beyond 20, so tens place: none. Hundreds place: none. So, total 4's:2. Counting 8's:8,18: units place (2), tens place: 80-89 beyond 20, so none. So, total 8's:2. So, difference is 0. Now, using my method: For 20 pages, 4's: units place:20/10=2, tens place: none (since 40-49 is beyond 20), hundreds place: none. So, 2 fours. 8's: units place:20/10=2, tens place: none, hundreds place: none. So, 2 eights. Difference is 0. Correct. So, my method works here. Another test: book with 50 pages. 4's: units place: 4,14,24,34,44:5 times. Tens place:40-49:10 times. Hundreds place: none. Total 4's:15. 8's: units place:8,18,28,38,48:5 times. Tens place:40-49: none (since 80-89 is beyond 50). Wait, no, in 50 pages, tens place for 8's would be 80-89, which is beyond 50, so 0. So, total 8's:5. So, difference is 15-5=10. Let me count manually: 4's:4,14,24,34,44 (5), and 40-49 (10), so 15. 8's:8,18,28,38,48 (5). So, 10 more 4's. Correct. So, my method works here too.
