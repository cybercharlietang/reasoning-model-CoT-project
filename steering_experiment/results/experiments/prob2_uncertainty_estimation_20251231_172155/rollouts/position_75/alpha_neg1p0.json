    "text": " So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly? Maybe I should consider another approach, like counting the number of times each digit appears in each position. For units place: For 4's, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, so 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing 1 four, so 48, plus the 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 fours in units place. Similarly, for 8's, 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing 1 eight, so 48, plus the 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in units place. Correct. For tens place: 4's: Each hundred has a block where tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers. So, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many such blocks are there in 488? Let's see: 40-49: yes, 140-149: yes, 240-249: yes, 340-349: yes, 440-449: yes. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50 fours in tens place. For 8's: Similarly, each hundred has a block where tens digit is 8, which is 10 numbers. So, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in tens place. Correct. For hundreds place: 4's: Numbers from 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. That's 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. So, 89 fours. 8's: No numbers from 800-899 are present, so 0 eights. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Total eights:49+49+0=98. Difference:188-98=90. So, yes, I think that's correct.
