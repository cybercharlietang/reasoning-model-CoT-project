    "text": " Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the tens place. Let me recount the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 in tens, 49 in units, total 98 eights. Wait, but earlier I thought units was 49 and tens was 49, so total 98. So, the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake. For the fours: units place, from 4,14,...484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each set has 10 numbers, so 5 sets: 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place:400-488. That's 488-400 +1=89 numbers. So, 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Correct. For the eights: units place, 8,18,...488. How many terms? (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10, and the last set has 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 in tens place. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90.

Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through the fours again. Units place: numbers ending with 4 from 4 to 484.

Each of the first four sets is 10 numbers, and the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So 49 eights in the tens place.

From 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers (since 488 -480 +1=9). So, yes, 9 in that set. So, total eights in tens place:49.

So, the number of terms is 49, since it starts at 0 and goes up to 48, inclusive. So, 49 terms, correct. Similarly, for tens place eights: each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, fours:188, eights:98. Difference:188-98=90.

From 8 to 488, step 10. So, (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total eights:49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 fours -98 eights=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (4, 14, 24, ..., 484):**\n   - Number of terms: \\( \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 49 \\)\n\n2. **Tens Place (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449):**\n   - Each block of 100 contributes 10 fours.\n   - Number of blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449)\n   - Total: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\)\n\n3. **Hundreds Place (400-488):**\n   - Number of pages: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\)\n   - Total: 89\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\)\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (8, 18, 28, ..., 488):**\n   - Number of terms: \\( \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 49 \\)\n\n2. **Tens Place (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488):**\n   - Each block of 100 contributes 10 eights, except the last block which contributes 9.\n   - Number of blocks: 5 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488)\n   - Total: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\)\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No pages in 488-page book have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\)\n\n**Difference:** \\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the tens place. Let me recount the tens place. The sets are: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49, yes. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me double-check the counting because sometimes it's easy to miss a number or miscount. Let me go through each digit position again for both digits. Starting with fours: Units place: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 488-400+1=89. Correct. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Now for eights: Units place:8,18,...488. (488-8)/10+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, since 800>488. So, eights:49+49=98. Difference:188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers is 188, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
