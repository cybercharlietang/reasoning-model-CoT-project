    "text": " Similarly, for the tens place of 8, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, the difference is 90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes I might miscount the ranges. Let me try another approach: for each digit position, count the number of times 4 and 8 appear. Starting with units place: For 4's, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4, so 48. But wait, the first set is 1-10, which includes 4, and the last set is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the last set is incomplete. But since 488 is included, the units digit 4 appears in 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. Wait, but 481-488 includes 484, which has a 4 in the units place. So, from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's the same as the number of times 4 is the units digit, which is floor(488/10) + (if 488 >= (4 mod 10) +1, but maybe it's easier to think of it as (488 + 6) //10. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the number of times is equal to the number of times 4 appears in 1-488 in units place. The formula is floor((n + 10 - d)/10), where d is the digit. So, for d=4, n=488: floor((488 + 10 -4)/10) = floor(494/10)=49. So, 49 times. Similarly, for 8's in units place: floor((488 +10 -8)/10)=floor(490/10)=49. So, 49 times. That matches my earlier count. Now, for the tens place: For 4's, in each block of 100 numbers, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. Wait, no, actually, 400-488 is the fifth block. So, in each of these blocks, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, for 1-100: 40-49 (10)\n101-200:140-149 (10)\n201-300:240-249 (10)\n301-400:340-349 (10)\n401-488:440-449 (10) because 440-449 is within 488. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 50. Correct. Now, for 8's in the tens place: In each block of 100, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc. From 1-488, how many such blocks? Let's see:\n\n- 1-100:80-89 (10)\n- 101-200:180-189 (10)\n- 201-300:280-289 (10)\n- 301-400:380-389 (10)\n- 401-488:480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, that's 4 blocks with 10 eights each, and one block with 9 eights. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nNow, hundreds place: For 4's, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. For 8's, the hundreds digit is 8 only in 800-899, which is beyond 488, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference might be 90, but I'm just making sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. Let me confirm: 400 to 488 inclusive. So, 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, correct.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding how many more 4's are printed than 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.

    "text": " Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, I could consider each digit position separately for all page numbers from 1 to 488 and count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each position. Let's try that approach to cross-verify. For the units place: For 488 pages, each digit from 0-9 appears equally in the units place, except possibly the last partial set. The number of complete sets of 10 in 488 is 48 full sets (since 48*10=480), with 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each full set, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place, so for 48 sets, 4 appears 48 times. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once more. So, total units place 4's:48+1=49. Correct. Similarly, for 8's in units place: in each full set of 10, 8 appears once, so 48 times. In the last 8 numbers, 8 appears once (at 488). So, total 8's in units:48+1=49. Correct. For the tens place: Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for every 100 numbers. So, for 488 pages, we have 4 full hundreds (1-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488). Wait, actually, it's better to think in terms of how many times each digit appears in the tens place. For the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each block of 100. So, for 488 pages, which is 4 full hundreds (1-400) and 88 pages (401-488). Wait, no, 488 is 4*100 +88, so up to 488, we have 4 full hundreds and then 88 more. So, in the tens place, each digit 0-9 appears 4 times 10 =40 times in the first 400 pages. Then, in the next 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-488). So, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place from 401-488? Let's see: - Tens digit 0: 401-410: 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 1:411-420:10\n- Tens digit 2:421-430:10\n- Tens digit 3:431-440:10\n- Tens digit 4:441-450:10\n- Tens digit 5:451-460:10\n- Tens digit 6:461-470:10\n- Tens digit 7:471-480:10\n- Tens digit 8:481-488:8 numbers (since 488 is the last)\n\nSo, in the tens place from 401-488, each digit from 0-7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times. So, total tens place counts for 4: in the first 400, 40 times (4 times 10). In the next 88 pages, tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450). So, total tens place 4's:40 +10=50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place: in the first 400, 40 times. In the next 88 pages, tens digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, total tens place 8's:40 +8=48. Wait, but earlier I had 49 for tens place 8's. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Wait, let me check again. When I did the initial count, I considered 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contributing 10, except the last which was 480-488 contributing 9. So that was 5 sets: 10+10+10+10+9=49. But using this alternative method, I'm getting 48. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, let's think carefully. The alternative method is considering the tens place from 1 to 488. Each full hundred contributes 10 times each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds contribute 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, from 401-488, which is 88 pages, the tens digits go up to 8 (for 481-488). So, in the tens place, digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, total tens place 8's:40 +8=48. But in my initial count, I had 49. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial count. Let me recount the tens place 8's. The numbers where the tens digit is 8 are:\n\n- 80-89:10 numbers\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 numbers\n\nSo, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. But according to the alternative method, it's 40 (from 1-400) plus 8 (from 401-488) =48. So, there's a discrepancy of 1. Where is the mistake?\n\nWait, in the alternative method, from 1-400, each digit in the tens place appears 40 times. Then, from 401-488, the tens digits go up to 8, appearing 8 times. So, total 48. But in the initial count, I have 49. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the initial count is wrong because in the 480-488 range, the tens digit is 8, but the units digits go from 0-8, so that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, adding 10+10+10+10+9=49. But according to the alternative method, it's 40+8=48. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the alternative method is missing something. Let's consider that from 1-400, each digit in the tens place appears exactly 40 times. Then, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place from 401-488?\n\n- Tens digit 0: 401-410:10 numbers\n- Tens digit 1:411-420:10\n- Tens digit 2:421-430:10\n- Tens digit 3:431-440:10\n- Tens digit 4:441-450:10\n- Tens digit 5:451-460:10\n- Tens digit 6:461-470:10\n- Tens digit 7:471-480:10\n- Tens digit 8:481-488:8 numbers\n\nSo, in the tens place from 401-488, digit 8 appears 8 times, as above. So, total tens place 8's:40 (from 1-400) +8 (from 401-488)=48. But in the initial count, I had 49. So, where is the discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps in the initial count, I included 480-488 as 9 numbers, but in reality, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), which is correct. So, in the tens place, digit 8 appears 9 times in 480-488, right? Because 480 has 8 in the tens place, and 481-488 also have 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, digit 8 appears 9 times in 480-488. So, in the alternative method, from 401-488, digit 8 in tens place appears 9 times, not 8. Because 480 is included in 401-488. Wait, 480 is 480, which is within 401-488. So, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the alternative method, from 401-488, digit 8 in tens place is 9, not 8. Therefore, total tens place 8's:40 (from 1-400) +9=49. So, that matches the initial count. So, my initial count was correct:49 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo, total eights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nSimilarly, for fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188.\n\nThus, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier in the alternative method, I thought that from 401-488, digit 8 in tens place appears 9 times, making total 40+9=49, which is correct. So, initial count was correct.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check once more to be sure. Another way to count the number of 4's and 8's is to consider each digit position separately across all page numbers.\n\nFor the units digit:\n\n- For 488 pages, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 pages. So, number of complete cycles is 48 full cycles (480 pages), with 8 remaining pages (481-488). Each cycle has one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, in 48 cycles, 48 fours and 48 eights. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units fours:48+1=49, units eights:48+1=49.\n\nFor the tens digit:\n\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for every 100 pages. So, for 488 pages, which is 4 full hundreds (400 pages) and 88 pages. In each full hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place, so for 4 hundreds, 40 times each digit. Then, in the next 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Let's count how many times each digit appears in the tens place:\n\n- Tens digit 0: 401-410:10\n- Tens digit 1:411-420:10\n- Tens digit 2:421-430:10\n- Tens digit 3:431-440:10\n- Tens digit 4:441-450:10\n- Tens digit 5:451-460:10\n- Tens digit 6:461-470:10\n- Tens digit 7:471-480:10\n- Tens digit 8:481-488:8\n\nSo, in the tens place, digit 4 appears 10 times (from 441-450), and digit 8 appears 8 times (from 481-488). So, total tens fours:40 (from 1-400) +10=50, and tens eights:40 +8=48.\n\nWait, but earlier, I had 49 eights in the tens place. Now, according to this, it's 48. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial count. Let's see: the numbers where the tens digit is 8 are:\n\n- 80-89:10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nBut according to the alternative method, from 1-400, it's 40, and from 401-488, it's 8, totaling 48. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the alternative method is missing the 480-488 range. Because 480-488 is within 401-488, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times there. So, from 401-488, tens digit 8 appears 9 times. So, total tens eights:40+9=49. So, the initial count was correct, and the alternative method was wrong because I thought it was 8, but it's actually 9.\n\nTherefore, the correct count for tens eights is 49.\n\nSimilarly, for fours in the tens place: from 1-400, 40 times, and from 401-488, 10 times (441-450), so total 50.\n\nSo, total fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188.\n\nTotal eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough. The answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
