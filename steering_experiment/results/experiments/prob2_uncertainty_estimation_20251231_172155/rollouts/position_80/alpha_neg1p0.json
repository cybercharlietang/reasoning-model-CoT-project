This is every 10th number, starting at 4 and ending at 484. The count is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** '4' appears in the tens digit in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** '4' appears in the hundreds digit for all numbers from 400 to 488. This is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 times.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of '8's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** '8' appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is every 10th number, starting at 8 and ending at 488. The count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** '8' appears in the tens digit in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges each contribute 10 numbers, and the last range (480-488) contributes 9 numbers. Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** '8' does not appear in the hundreds digit because the book only goes up to 488. So, 0 times.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Therefore, the final answer should be 90. But wait, let me check another way. Maybe I can think of it as the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position. Let me try that.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- For 4's: From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's floor(488/10) + (if the last digit is >=4, add 1). Wait, no, it's better to think as the number of complete decades. 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, plus the 48th decade ends at 480, so the next numbers are 481-488, which includes 484, which is another 4. So, 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\n- For 8's: Similarly, 488/10=48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then in the last partial decade (481-488), there's 488, which has an 8. So, 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For 4's: The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49). So, how many full hundreds are there in 488? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's:40+10=50. Correct.\n\n- For 8's: Similarly, the tens digit is 8 in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, total tens place 8's:40+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- For 4's: The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488. That's 89 numbers, as before. So, 89 fours.\n\n- For 8's: The hundreds digit is 8 only from 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are 0 eights here.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: units(49) + tens(50) + hundreds(89) = 188.\n\n8's: units(49) + tens(49) + hundreds(0) = 98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of 4's: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Number of 4's: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of 4's: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of 8's: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 eights each, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Number of 8's: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
