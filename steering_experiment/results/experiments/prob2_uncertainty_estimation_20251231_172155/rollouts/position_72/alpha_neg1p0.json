Wait, but I feel like I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. For 8's, in the tens place, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights there. So, 49 eights in tens place. So, 49+49=98. Hmm, seems correct.
