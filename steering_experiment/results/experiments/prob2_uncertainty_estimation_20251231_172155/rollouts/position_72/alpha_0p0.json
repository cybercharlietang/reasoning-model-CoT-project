Did I count correctly for the tens place in the 8's? For example, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, yes, that's 9. So, 5 sets, the last being 9, so 49 in total. So, yes, 49 in tens place. Units place is 49, so total 98. 4's:188, so 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but let me check another way. Maybe using a formula or another counting method. Alternatively, I can think of each digit position separately and count the number of times 4 and 8 appear. Let me try that.\n\nFor the units digit:\n- For 4's: As before, 49 times.\n- For 8's: 49 times.\n\nFor the tens digit:\n- For 4's: 50 times (from 40-49, etc.)\n- For 8's: 49 times (from 80-89, etc.)\n\nFor the hundreds digit:\n- For 4's: 89 times (400-488)\n- For 8's: 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think the answer is 90. But wait, let me check if I didn't overcount anywhere. For example, in the tens place for 8's, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place there, making it 49 in total. Correct. And for 4's in the hundreds place, it's 89 numbers from 400 to 488 inclusive. Correct. So, I think I'm confident that the difference is 90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This is 49 occurrences (from 0 to 484, every 10 numbers).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - This is 89 occurrences (488 - 400 + 1).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This is 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Is there any overlap where a page number has both 4 and 8, like 484? But when counting digits, each occurrence is counted separately, so 484 would have a 4 in hundreds, 8 in tens, and 4 in units. So, each digit is counted in their respective places. So, the total counts are accurate. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (ones place):** The digit '4' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). The sequence starts at 4 and ends at 484. The number of such occurrences is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling:\n     \\[\n     5 \\times 10 = 50\n     \\]\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place for all page numbers from 400 to 488, inclusive. The count is:\n     \\[\n     488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n     \\]\n   - **Total '4's:** Summing up all occurrences:\n     \\[\n     49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n     \\]\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '8' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). The sequence starts at 8 and ends at 488. The number of such occurrences is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '8' appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each full range contributes 10 occurrences, and the last range (480-488) contributes 9. The total is:\n     \\[\n     4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49\n     \\]\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is '8' since the book ends at 488. Thus, the count is 0.\n   - **Total '8's:** Summing up all occurrences:\n     \\[\n     49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of '8's from the total number of '4's:\n     \\[\n     188 - 98 = 90\n     \\]\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's. \n\n\\boxed{90}"
