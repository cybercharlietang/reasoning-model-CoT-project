So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility I double-counted any numbers? For example, in the 440-449 range, the hundreds digit is 4 and the tens digit is 4, so each number there has two 4's. Similarly, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8 and the hundreds digit is 4. So, when I count the 4's in hundreds place, I'm counting each 440-449 as having a 4 in hundreds and tens. So, when I count units, tens, and hundreds, I'm correctly counting each occurrence, so that's fine. Similarly, for 8's, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but the hundreds digit is 4, so no overlap in counting. So, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the difference is 90.

For 4's in the hundreds place, yes, 400-488 is 89 numbers. For 8's, since the book only goes up to 488, there's no 800-899, so 0. So, 89 more 4's just in the hundreds place.

    "text": " Let me count the numbers in each set. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds. Total 8's:98. So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct. Wait, but let me think again. Another way to count the number of times a digit appears is to consider each digit position separately and calculate how many times each digit appears in each position. For example, for units digit, in 1-488, how many 4's and 8's? Similarly for tens and hundreds. Let me try that approach to verify. For the units digit: In each block of 10 numbers, each digit from 0-9 appears once. So, in 488 numbers, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 /10=48.8, so 48 complete blocks, and a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). In each complete block, 4 appears once in the units place, and 8 appears once. So, for units place: 48 blocks *1=48 fours and 48 eights. Then, in the partial block (481-488), the units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place: fours=48+1=49, eights=48+1=49. That matches what I had before. Now, for the tens place: Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, in 488 numbers, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly 10 where it's 8 (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, 4 hundreds *10=40 fours and 40 eights. Then, the remaining 88 numbers (401-488). In this partial hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0-8. So, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is fully included. So, that's 10 fours. Similarly, 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, in the partial hundred, fours in tens place:10, eights:9. So total tens place: fours=40+10=50, eights=40+9=49. That's correct. Now, hundreds place: For fours, in 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). So, fours in hundreds place:89. For eights, the hundreds digit is 8 only from 800-899, which is beyond 488, so no eights in hundreds place. So, total eights in hundreds place:0. Adding up: fours=49(units)+50(tens)+89(hundreds)=188. Eights=49(units)+49(tens)+0(hundreds)=98. So, 188-98=90. So, I think that's correct.

I think that's correct. Maybe I should check with a smaller example to see if my method works. Let's say a book with 20 pages. How many 4's and 8's? Page numbers 1-20. Counting 4's: units place:4,14 (2 times). Tens place:40-49, but since it's only up to 20, no 4's in tens place. Hundreds place: none. So, 2 fours. 8's: units place:8,18 (2 times). Tens place:80-89, but up to 20, so none. So, 2 eights. So, difference is 0. Using my method: For 20 pages, 4's: units: (20-4)/10 +1? Wait, maybe not. Wait, up to 20, units place 4's:4,14, which is 2. Similarly, units place 8's:8,18, which is 2. So, difference is 0. So, my method works here. Another example: 100 pages. 4's: units:10 (4,14,...,94), tens:10 (40-49), hundreds:0 (since 100 is the last, but 100 doesn't have a hundreds digit of 4). So, 10+10=20 fours. 8's: units:10 (8,18,...,98), tens:10 (80-89), hundreds:0. So, 10+10=20 eights. Difference is 0. So, in 100 pages, same number.

So, the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of '4's:**\n   - **Units place:** Every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. The digit '4' appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades (1-480) and 8 extra numbers (481-488). Each full decade contributes 1 '4' in the units place, totaling 48. The extra numbers (481-488) include 484, which adds another '4', making it 49.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149). There are 5 such sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449) within 1-488, each contributing 10 '4's, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n\n   Total '4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of '8's:**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to '4's, the digit '8' appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades and 8 extra numbers. Each full decade contributes 1 '8', totaling 48. The extra numbers (481-488) include 488, adding another '8', making it 49.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit '8' appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189). There are 4 full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 '8's, totaling 40. The last set is 480-488, which contributes 9 '8's (480-488). Total '8's in tens place = 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit '8' does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n   Total '8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's = 188\n   - Number of '8's = 98\n   - Difference = 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 times more than the digit '8' in the page numbers.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Hmm, so the difference is 90. Wait, but let me think again. When I count the tens place for 8's, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place for that set. So, yes, 49 in tens place. So total 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe I missed something. Let me think again. Another way to count is to consider each digit position separately and calculate how many times each digit appears. For units place: for 4's, it's every 10 numbers, so in 488 pages, the number of 4's in units place is floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 ends with 8, the last 4 in units place is 484, which is the 49th occurrence. Similarly, for 8's, the last occurrence is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, both have 49 in units place. For tens place: For 4's, it's 10 per hundred, so 4 times 100 (400-499), but since we only go up to 488, the 400-488 gives 89 numbers, but wait no, in the tens place, each hundred has a block where tens digit is 4. So, 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 50 fours. For 8's, tens digit is 8 in 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-489. But since we stop at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, totaling 49. For hundreds place: 4's are from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. 8's are from 800-899, which don't exist here, so 0. So, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, 188-98=90. So, yes, I think that's correct.

Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges each contribute 10 numbers, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check: 400-488 is 89 numbers. But 400-488 includes 400,401,...,488. So, 488-400+1=89. Correct.

Hmm, but wait, let me think about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct. And for 8's, since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, the difference is indeed 90.

    "text": " Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I feel like maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me think again. For the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct. For the tens place, each hundred block has a 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks (0-99,100-199,...,400-488) but wait, 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit 4 in 400-488 would be from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, right? So, that's correct. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 49 in total. So, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the difference is 90.
