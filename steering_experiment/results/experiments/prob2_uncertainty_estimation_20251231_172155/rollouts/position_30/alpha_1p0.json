    "text": " Wait, no, because 400 is the first, then 401, 402,... up to 488. So that's 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4. Therefore, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check again. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems high. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me recount. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many? The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) + 1. So, (484)/10 = 48.4, floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. That's correct. Tens place: Each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many hundreds blocks are there? Up to 488, so the hundreds digits go up to 4. So, 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 5*10=50. That's correct. Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Hmm, okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, we'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many. The last number is 488, which is the units digit 8. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers. So, how many? The count is floor((488 - 8)/10) +1. So, (480)/10=48, floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's see how many hundred blocks we have. From 0-99: 80-89: 10 eights. 100-199: 180-189: 10. 200-299: 280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488: 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). Wait, so in the 400-488 block, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, we have 4 blocks where the tens digit is 8, each contributing 10, except the last block which contributes 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. Difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The last block (480-488) has 9 occurrences, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, when I counted the units place, I thought 484 is the last one, so that's 484 / 10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. Similarly, for the tens place, each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, so 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. For the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, 8, 18, ..., 488. Let me check: 488 is the last page, so yes, it's included. So units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that's 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that's a big difference. Let me double-check my counting because I might have made a mistake. Let's recount the fours and eights.\n\nCounting fours again:\n\n- Units place: from 4, 14, 24,...,484. How many terms? The sequence is 4 + 10(n-1) = 484. So, 10(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 fours in units place.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So, 5 sets of 10, which is 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 +89=188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, eights:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488. Let's see: 488-8=480, divided by 10 is 48, so 49 numbers. So, 49.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: none, as before.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 fours and 98 eights. The difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place for fours. Let me check: from 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. That seems right.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place in eights, I have 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 eights in the tens place for that set. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) and one set of 9, totaling 49.\n\nSo, yes, 98 eights.\n\nThus, the difference is 90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count each set: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So total is 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. When I count 80-89, that's 10 eights in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Counting fours: Units: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. Counting eights: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me think about the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct. For the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. Correct. Units place: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so 4,14,24,...,484. How many? 484 is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Correct. For eights, units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1)=480, n-1=48, n=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: no eights. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, fours:188, eights:98. Difference:90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the digit '4':**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, hundreds place has 89 fours. So total number of fours is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49, correct. Tens place: Each hundred block has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place.

Yes. So, how many terms? The first term is 8, last term is 488. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 fall within 488? Yes, up to 488. So, let's count: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). Wait, is that correct? Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, only 480-488 are included, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. So total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me double-check the tens place for eights. I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, but let me count: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers, correct. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total eights:98. Fours:188.

So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-489: but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total eights are units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check the counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for fours. Let me check that again. In the tens place for fours: from 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours in the tens place. That seems right. And in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units place: 49 fours. So, total 188 fours. For eights: units place, 49 eights, correct because 8,18,...,488. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. So, total eights 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block (480-488) which has 9.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, let me check: 400 is the first, 401, 402,...,488. So that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last number is 488, so how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be the next set, but our book ends at 488. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers because 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights:98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the tens place for 8 again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct.

So, total fours would be units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each, so that's 89 fours. Units place: from 4 to 484, that's 484/10 = 48.4, but since we include 484, it's 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is 10, 240-249 is 10, 340-349 is 10, 440-449 is 10. So that's 5 sets, 10 each, so 50. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, starting at 8, the last number with an 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last one, so 480,481,...,488, which is 9 numbers). Wait, no, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, so 4*10=40. The last set, 480-488, contributes 9 eights. So total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total eights are units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me check the counts again.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units: 49 (from 4,14,...,484)\n- Tens: 50 (10 each for 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449)\n- Hundreds: 89 (400-488)\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor eights:\n- Units: 49 (8,18,...,488)\n- Tens: 49 (10 each for 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 9 for 480-488)\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for fours. From 40-49: 10 fours, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, so 50 fours. Correct.\n\nFor eights in the tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nUnits place for both: 49 each. So, total fours 188, eights 98. Difference is 90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Wait, but actually, in the hundreds place, each number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds digit, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's.

Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488 \u2192 10(n-1) = 480 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n=49.

So, let's count how many sets of tens have 8 in the tens place. Each set from 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-489. But since 489 is beyond 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many full sets are there? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

    "text": " Wait, but I'm only counting the hundreds digit being 4. So, every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me check: 400 is the first, 488 is the last. So the count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but wait, 400-488 includes numbers where the hundreds digit is 4, so yes, that's correct. So, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is included, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place? Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but I'm considering the tens digit being 8. So, for each hundred block, 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's see how many complete blocks there are. From 1-488, the hundreds go up to 4. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. Wait, because 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

So total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first 4 is at 4, then every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, the last 4 in units is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So units place is 49. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The first is 8, last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. So units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in tens place is in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8. Let's see: Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. So total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, but wait, in the tens place, when I did 480-488, that's 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is the first, then 481, 482, ..., up to 488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place for that block. So total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49, as I had before. So total eights: 49+49=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, how many more fours than eights? 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\( \\frac{484}{10} + 1 = 49 \\)  \n   So, 49 fours in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.  \n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 fours in the tens place.  \n   - Total blocks contributing: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\)  \n   So, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\)  \n   So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\)\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\( \\frac{488}{10} + 1 = 49 \\)  \n   So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.  \n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place.  \n   - For the last block (480-488), only 9 numbers contribute (480-488).  \n   - Total blocks contributing: 4 full blocks and 1 partial block.  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\)  \n   So, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book only goes up to 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences: 0\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\)\n\n**Difference between the number of 4's and 8's:**  \n\\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but we're only concerned with the hundreds digit being 4, so every number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last one is 488. How many? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but including 488, that's 49 occurrences. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is within the book. Since the book goes up to 488, 480-488 are included. So, each set of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last, so 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 488-480=8, so 9 numbers. So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 eights in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40. The last set is 480-488, which has 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights are units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Wait, does the hundreds place have a 4 in all those numbers? Yes, because 400-499 would have 4 in the hundreds place, but since we only go up to 488, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours. But wait, 488 is the last page. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the units digit 4 occurs 49 times because 488 is included, and the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units: 49. Tens place: each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4, so from 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, so 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, but let's check. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, 488/10=48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights. But wait, does 488 count? 488 is the last page, so the units digit 8 occurs at 8,18,...,488. So, how many? Let's see: the first is 8, then 18, 28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

    "text": " Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, which would give 48 numbers, but including 488, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, 8,18,...,488. How many? Let me think: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Each of these blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, first, how many full blocks are there? From 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 full blocks of 10, which is 40, plus 9 in the last partial block, so total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, I subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " Wait, no, the hundreds digit is only 4, so every number from 400-488 has a hundreds digit of 4. So, that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, total 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many. The first is 8, and the last is 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take 48 full groups, which gives 48 eights, but wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40 and +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9, so total 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89, total=188. For the 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0, total=98. 188-98=90. That seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Wait, but I'm only counting the digit 4 in the hundreds place, so every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Wait, units place: 4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers, so 49 fours. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89 fours. So total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, but does 488 count? The last page is 488, so yes. So, how many such numbers? Starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one more 8. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is the last set. So, how many sets? Each hundred has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? Because 480 has 8 in the tens place, 481 too, up to 488. So that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check the tens place for 8's. So, in each hundred block, 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contributes 10 eights. But in the last block, 480-488, that's only 9 numbers, but each has 8 in the tens place, so 9 eights. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, number of 4's is 188, and number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the units place. From 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The sequence starts at 4, ends at 484, with a common difference of 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the units place: 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, so ((488-8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nFor the tens place, 4's: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, and there are 5 blocks (40-49 is the first, then 140-149, etc., up to 440-449). So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place.\n\nFor the hundreds place, 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188 fours.\n\nFor the 8's in the tens place: 80-89,180-189,...,480-488. The first four blocks (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) each have 10 eights, and the last block (480-488) has 9 eights. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights.\n\nSo, 49+49=98 eights.\n\nTherefore, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count the 4's correctly in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 +1=89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the tens place, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me recount. The blocks are:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place.\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, 49 eights in the tens place, plus 49 in the units place, totaling 98. So, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I included all the 8's correctly. For example, in the units place, 488 is included, which is correct. In the tens place, 480-488 is included, which is correct. So, yes, 98 eights.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 fours, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488.

Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of fours is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first is 4, then every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, the last 4 in units place is 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50 fours in the tens place.

Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The first is 8, then every 10 numbers. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. So, each set like 80-89 is 10 numbers, contributing 10 eights in the tens place. How many such sets are there? From 0-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, for the tens place, each full set (like 80-89) contributes 10 eights, but the last set (480-488) only contributes 9 eights. So, how many full sets are there? The first four sets are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four sets, each with 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, the last set is 480-488, which has 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), but the tens digit is 8 for all of them.

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many sets of 100 have the tens digit as 8. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-489 would be 10, but we only go up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (total 40) plus 9, which is 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that right? Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total number of eights is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we'll analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This is every 10th number, so there are 49 occurrences (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each hundred has 10 such numbers, and there are 5 hundreds (0-400, 100-199, ..., 400-488).\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Similar to 4's, this is 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each hundred has 10 such numbers, except the last set (480-488) which has 9.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\nSo, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Wait, but let me check: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but let's check: 8, 18, ..., 488. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? The formula is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? But our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

    "text": " Wait, but I'm only counting the hundreds digit, which is 4. So, every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 fours. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Hmm, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's 484 /10 = 48.4, so 49 times. Tens place: Each hundred block has 10, and there are 4 full hundreds (1-400), but wait, 400 is the start of the hundreds digit being 4. Wait, actually, from 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50.

Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see, 488 is the last page. So, the last occurrence is 488. So, how many 8's in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488 is 49 numbers. Wait, but does 488 count as the 49th? Let me check: from 0 to 488, how many multiples of 10 plus 8? The formula is floor((488 - 8)/10) + 1. So, (480)/10 = 48, plus 1 is 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? Let's see: Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-489 would be 10, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's are 188, and total 8's are 98. Subtracting, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through each digit place again for both 4's and 8's. Starting with 4's: Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10,140-149:10,240-249:10,340-349:10,440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total 4's:49+50+89=188. Correct. Now for 8's: Units place:8,18,...,488. Number of terms: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: None, so 0. Total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check: 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Correct. Wait, but in the tens place for 4's, I had 50, which is 5 sets of 10. That's correct because 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. So, 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. So, total 4's is indeed 188, and 8's is 98. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems a bit high. Let me think differently. Maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each position again, but more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a formula for each digit place. For any digit position, the number of times a digit appears can be calculated by considering higher, current, and lower digits.\n\nBut maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each position again.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 4,14,24,...,484. As before, that's 49 numbers.\n\nTens place: 40-49:10,140-149:10,240-249:10,340-349:10,440-449:10. So, 5 sets, each 10, total 50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488:89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\nUnits place:8,18,28,...,488. That's 49 numbers.\n\nTens place:80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So, 49 numbers.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, maybe 90 is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check for 8's in the tens place again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 49 in tens place, 49 in units place, total 98. So, 188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 400-488. This contributes 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

    "text": " Wait, actually, 400-499 would be 100 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. That's 484/10 = 48.4, but since we include 484, it's 49. Tens place: Each hundred has 10, and there are 5 hundreds (0-4), but wait, actually, in 1-488, the hundreds digit is 0 for 1-99, 1 for 100-199, etc., up to 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. That's 5 times 10, which is 50. So that's correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each set from 80-89, etc., has 10 numbers, but the last set (480-488) has only 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, let's calculate: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. Each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, so that's 4*10=40. The last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so total tens place 8's: 40+9=49. That's correct. So, total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, let me confirm: 400 is the first, 401 is next, up to 488. So, yes, 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.

Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. Wait, 8, 18, ..., 488: that's 49 times. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 numbers, but the last block (480-488) has only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, no: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, total is 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 98 eights. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that's correct. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. But wait, 400 is included, so 488-400+1=89. Correct. And for the tens place in fours, we had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Correct. For eights, in the tens place, we had 4 full sets (80-89, etc.) and the last partial set (480-488) which is 9, so 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Units place for both is 49.

    "text": " Wait, but the hundreds digit is 4 only in 400-488, so that's 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4. But wait, when considering the hundreds place, each number contributes exactly one 4 in that position. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. In the tens place, each hundred block contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 5*10=50. Units place: every 10 numbers, so from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in units place? The first 4 is at 4, then every 10 numbers. So, the number of times is floor(488/10) + 1 if 488 mod 10 >=4. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. Then, since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is greater than or equal to 4, so we add 1. So, 48 +1=49 fours in units place. So total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. Now, since 488 is included, which is 488, so 488 has an 8 in units place. So, total units place 8's: 48 +1=49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each set before that (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers, but the last set 480-488 has 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9). So, let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the difference between number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 98 = 90.

For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units: 4,14,...,484: that's (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Tens: Each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in tens place. How many hundreds are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is only part of the 400s. So, in the 400s, the tens place 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, in each hundred block except the last one, we have 10 numbers with 4 in tens place. So, 0-99: 10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, and 400-488:10 (from 440-449).

So total 4's: 49 + 50 +89= 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488.

So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** '4' appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, each number has '4' in the hundreds place, totaling 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** '8' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** '8' appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The last block (480-488) has 9 occurrences. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have '8' in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many that is. The first is 8, and the last is 488. If I divide 488 by 10, I get 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are. Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488-480+1=9). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488). So, for the tens place, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, so 4 sets \u00d710=40. The last set, 480-488, contributes 9 eights. So total in tens place is 40 +9=49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total number of eights is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, to find how many more fours than eights, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., but only up to 488, giving 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me list them: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.

Hmm, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. Difference=188-98=90. Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For the tens place of 4's, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Units place: 49. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's, units:49, tens:49, so 98.

That's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, yes, 9 eights in the tens place there.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the units place was 49 and tens was 49, so 98 eights. Now, the fours were 188. So, the difference would be 188 -98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours. Let me recount the fours:\n\nUnits place: from 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many terms? The formula is (last - first)/step +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, units place:49 fours.\n\nTens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks:5*10=50 fours.\n\nHundreds place:400-488. That's 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nEights:\n\nUnits place:8,18,...,488. So, same as units place for fours:49 eights.\n\nTens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks gives 10 eights, and the last block gives 9. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nSo, total eights:49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check if I missed any cases. For example, in the hundreds place for fours, does 400-488 include 488? Yes, so that's correct.

    "text": " Wait, no, the hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488, so that's 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many numbers? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. That's correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 4, so from 1-400, that's 4 sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40.

So total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many. The first is 8, last is 488. So, (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Numbers where tens digit is 8. These are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. So, let's count. Each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 8: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, it's 10 +10 +10 +10 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: from 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Each hundred block contributes 10, so 4 hundreds (1-400) would have 4*10=40, but wait, 400-488 is part of the fifth hundred? Wait, no, 400-488 is still within the 400-499 range, which is part of the fourth hundred (if we consider 1-100, 101-200, etc.), but actually, 400-488 is part of the 400-499 block. So, in the tens place, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, but the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of fours is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but the last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. But wait, the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is within range, but 480-489 would be beyond 488. So, let's count the blocks. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40 eights. Wait, but 480-489 isn't fully included because the book ends at 488. So, in the 400s, the tens digit 8 would be from 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, in the hundreds place, 480-488 is part of the 400s, but the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that. So, in the tens place, 8 can be in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 40, but that was without considering the 480-488. So, total tens place eights: 49. Hmm, that seems high. Wait, let me check again. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last hundred (400-488), which has only 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (480-488). So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total number of eights is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't double count or miss anything. Let me recount the units and tens places. Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. How many numbers? From 8 to 488, step 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in units place. Tens place: as above, 49 eights. So, total eights: 49 + 49 = 98. Now, for fours, I had 188 fours. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check the fours count because earlier I thought units place had 49, tens had 50, and hundreds had 89, totaling 188. Let me confirm each part again. Units place fours: 4,14,24,...,484. Number of terms: ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place fours: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets of 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place fours: 400-488. That's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Correct. So, 49 +50 +89=188 fours. Eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. So, 98 eights. Difference: 188 -98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers.

The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. Wait, 8,18,...,488. How many? Let's compute: (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the book. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's break it down: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: this is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 eights in the tens place. So total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Then 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, does 480-489 exist? Well, the book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8 in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480, 481, ..., 488. So, in the tens place, 8 appears in 480-488 as well, but only 9 times. Wait, but earlier I thought each block is 10 numbers, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 9 numbers. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let me count the blocks:\n\n- 80-89: 10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo, total is 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place.

So, total in tens place is 49 eights. Wait, but earlier I thought each block before 400 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, so 4*10 +9=49.

Units place: 49 eights, tens place:49 eights, hundreds:0. So, total eights:98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, starting at 8, the last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many such numbers? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. To find how many terms, we can consider it as an arithmetic sequence where the first term is 8, the last term is 488, and the common difference is 10. The formula for the nth term is a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 8: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n-1, so n=49. So, there are 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term 4, last term 484, and common difference 10.\n   - Number of terms = ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total = 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - This range includes 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n   - Total = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term 8, last term 488, and common difference 10.\n   - Number of terms = ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks each contribute 10 occurrences, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Total = 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total = 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, but the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let me check that again. Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of that. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, how many such blocks are there? From 1-400, there are 4 blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each contributes 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 more eights in the tens place. So total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me make sure. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: Units:49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total:188. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total:98. Difference:188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I overcounted the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check that again. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. So, 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. And for the tens place, 440-449 is included, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours there. So, 50 in the tens place. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers. So, 49 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's, units place:49, tens place:49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences (from 4 to 484).\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), totaling 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).

Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences for the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), totaling 40 occurrences. The last block (480-488) contributes 9 occurrences, making a total of 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, no, 400 is the first, 488 is the last, so 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but including 488, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let me count how many full blocks there are. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9 (480,481,...,488). So yes, 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.
