    "text": " Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers. Let me break it down: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. - 180-189: 10 eights. - 280-289: 10 eights. - 380-389: 10 eights. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, adding these up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in numbers 400-488.  \n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, let's add up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me see how many there are. The last occurrence is 488, so I can calculate how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first is 8, then every 10 numbers. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, 8, 18, ..., 488: that's (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 count? Since the book goes up to 488, 480-488 is included. So, how many sets are there? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers? No, wait: 480 is the first, then up to 488 is 9 numbers (including both). Wait, 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, yes, 9 numbers. So total eights in tens place: 10 +10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488. \n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449, totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488, totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, for the tens place, it's 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Wait, 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, so that's 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 40+9=49.

From 480 to 488, inclusive, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, in the units place, I think I made a mistake. Because up to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) + 1 if the last digit is >=4. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, but since 488's units digit is 8, which is greater than 4, so we add 1, making it 49. That part was correct. Then, tens place: each hundred has 10, so from 0-99: 10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, and 400-488: how many? Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, but how many tens digits are 4 in that range? From 400-409: 10, 410-419:10, ..., up to 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, so in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. Each of these is 10 numbers except the last one, which is 9. So that's 8 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 8*10 +9=89? Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 400-409: 10, 410-419:10, 420-429:10, 430-439:10, 440-449:10, 450-459:10, 460-469:10, 470-479:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 9 sets, where the first 8 are 10 each, and the last is 9. So total tens digits with 4 is 8*10 +9=89. Wait, but that would mean that in the hundreds place, we have 89 fours, but wait, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 exactly 89 times. So, the tens digit in the 400-488 range is also 89 times? That seems confusing. Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let's consider each digit place separately without overlapping. For the tens place, the 4 can be in the tens digit in numbers like x4y, where x is 0-4 and y is 0-9, but considering the overall range up to 488. So, for the tens digit 4, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4, but when hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can only go up to 8 (since 488 is the limit). So, for hundreds digits 0,1,2,3, each can have 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 040-049, 140-149, etc.), but since we start at 1, 040 is 40, which is valid. So, for hundreds digits 0,1,2,3: each has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, for hundreds digit 4, the tens digit can be 4, but only up to 488. So, when hundreds digit is 4, tens digit is 4, and the units digit can be 0-8 (since 488 is the limit). So, that's 9 numbers: 440-448. Wait, but 440-449 would be 10 numbers, but since we stop at 488, the tens digit can only go up to 8 in the units place. So, for hundreds digit 4 and tens digit 4, units digits are 0-8, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens digit 4's: 40 (from hundreds 0-3) +9 (from hundreds 4) =49. Wait, that's different from my earlier count. So, total tens digit 4's are 49. Then, units digit 4's: as before, 49. Hundreds digit 4's: 89. So total 4's: 49 +49 +89= 187. Wait, that's different from my initial 188. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check. So, for the tens digit, hundreds digits 0-3: each has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4, so 4*10=40. Then, hundreds digit 4: tens digit 4, units digits 0-8: 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. So, tens digit 4's:49. Units digit 4's:49. Hundreds digit 4's:89. So total 4's:49+49+89=187. Wait, but earlier I thought units digit was 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, totaling 188. So, I must have made a mistake in the tens digit count earlier. So, correct count is 49 tens digits, 49 units, 89 hundreds: total 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units digit 8's:49. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like x8y, where x is 0-4, and y is 0-9, but considering the limit of 488. For hundreds digits 0,1,2,3: each can have 10 numbers where tens digit is 8 (e.g., 080-089, 180-189, etc.), so 4*10=40. For hundreds digit 4: tens digit 8, units digit 0-8 (since 488 is the limit). So, numbers 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, tens digit 8's:40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits with 8. So, hundreds digit 8's:0. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 -98=89. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 89. Total 187. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me make sure I didn't double-count any numbers. For example, in the hundreds place, 400-488, each number has a hundreds digit of 4, but when counting the tens and units digits, those are separate. So, no overlap there. Similarly, in the tens and units places, each digit is considered separately, so no double-counting. So, I think the counts are accurate. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 89 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens digit in numbers like x4y, where x is 0-4 and y is 0-9.\n   - For hundreds digits 0,1,2,3: each contributes 10 numbers, totaling 40.\n   - For hundreds digit 4: tens digit 4, units digits 0-8 (since 488 is the limit), contributing 9 numbers.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens digit in numbers like x8y, where x is 0-4 and y is 0-9.\n   - For hundreds digits 0,1,2,3: each contributes 10 numbers, totaling 40.\n   - For hundreds digit 4: tens digit 8, units digits 0-8 (since 488 is the limit), contributing 9 numbers.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **89**.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but let's check: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 =48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count: Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 in 480-488. So, 4*10=40 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

    "text": " So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, every 10 numbers adds one. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Each full block (80-89, etc.) has 10 eights in the tens place. There are 4 full blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4*10=40. Now, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, in the tens place, that's 9 eights. So total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights.

Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many there are. The last occurrence is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 also count? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's see: Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10, so 40 eights. But wait, the last block is 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, 480-488 contributes 9 eights instead of 10. So, total tens place eights: 40 (from the first four blocks) +9=49. Wait, no, because 480-488 is the fifth block, so maybe I should consider each hundred separately. Let me think again. From 1-400: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's four blocks, each with 10 eights in the tens place, so 40 eights. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, plus 89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't overcount in the tens place for eights. When counting the tens place eights, I considered 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10, and then 480-488 contributing 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct. Similarly, for fours in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, yes, 188 fours and 98 eights, difference is 90.

Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included. So, from 8 to 488 in units place: 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 count? Since the book ends at 488, 480-488 would have 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189:10 - 280-289:10 - 380-389:10 - 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page) So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

    "text": " So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one. So, 8,18,...,488: that's 49 times. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count: Each full set (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers each, so that's 4 sets \u00d710 =40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place is 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90. Wait, that can't be right because 188-98 is 90, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place for 4's, I considered 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449, which is 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5\u00d710=50. That seems right. For 8's in tens place, I had 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, which is 4 sets, each 10, so 40, and then 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 40+9=49. That also seems correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because 488 is the last page, so in the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. That's correct. So, yes, the difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   Total occurrences: 5 sets \u00d710 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in 400-488.  \n   Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   Total occurrences: 4 sets \u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 also count? But since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 in 480-488 is valid. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, does 480-489 have 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, the tens place eights would be 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 full blocks of 10 and one partial block of 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, that doesn't seem right because when I thought about the tens place, I had 49 eights. Let me double-check the tens place. For the tens digit 8, we have:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo that's 4*10 +9=49. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. Now, the fours were 188, and the eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check my counting again, maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let's recount the fours:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many terms? From 4 to 484 with step 10. So, (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 50 fours. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nNow for eights:\n\n- Units place:8,18,...,488. How many terms? From 8 to 488 with step 10. So, (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, and the last block has 9 numbers (480-488). So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: none, since 800+ is beyond 488. So, 0.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1=89. So, 89 fours. That's correct. So, the total fours are 49+50+89=188. Eights are 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I feel like that might not be correct because sometimes when counting digits, especially in higher places, you might have overlaps or miscounts. Let me try another approach. Maybe I can count the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor the units place:\n\n- Fours: every 10 numbers, so for 488 pages, the number of fours in units place is floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 ends with 8, the last four in units place is at 484, which is the 49th four. So, 49 fours.\n\n- Eights: similarly, floor(488/10)=48, but 488 is included, so 49 eights.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Fours: in the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block is 100 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers. So, for 488 pages, how many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-400), and then 88 more. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total tens place fours:40+10=50.\n\n- Eights: in the tens place, 8 appears in 80-89,180-189,...,380-389,480-488. Each full hundred has 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, total tens place eights:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- Fours: in the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\n- Eights: in the hundreds place, 8 would appear from 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\nFours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99+89=188.\n\nEights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, that's the same result as before. So, I think my initial calculation was correct. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None \u2192 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 8. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, so that's 4*10=40. Now, for 480-488, how many numbers? From 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90.

Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with an 8. So, how many such numbers are there? The first is 8, and the last is 488. To find the count, I can calculate (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488.

So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many there are. The last occurrence is 488, which is the units digit. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Let's see: Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, is that correct? Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, for the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488).

Units place: From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups, each contributing a 4, plus one more in 484. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, so 4 sets (1-400, 101-200, etc.)? Wait, no, actually, from 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49+50+89=188.

The last occurrence is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, how many sets? Each hundred has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. From 1-400, that's 4 sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389). Then, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4 sets *10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. Difference=188-98=90. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. Let me recount the tens place for 8's. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in the following ranges: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So that's 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct. So, total 8's in tens place=49. So, total 8's=49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because I thought the hundreds place for 4's was 89, which is correct because 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in hundreds place. Yeah, that seems right.

I'll do the same for each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but let's check: 8,18,28,...,488.

So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, so 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the tens place in 480-488 contributes 9 eights. So total tens place eights are 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place.

Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through the fours again: units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For the eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place for fours. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. For the tens place of fours, I counted 50, which is 10 per hundred, times 5 hundreds (0-400, but actually starting from 40-49, etc.), but wait, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Correct. For the units place of fours, 49, because from 4,14,...,484, which is 49 numbers. Now, for the eights: units place is 49, same as fours. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, which is 49. So, 49 in tens place.

Let me check how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which suggests 49 numbers. Wait, but does 488 count as the 49th? Let me list them: 8,18,28,...,488. From 0 to 488, that's 49 numbers because 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many sets we have. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4, 14, ..., 484. This results in 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8, 18, ..., 488. This results in 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book doesn't reach 800.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets, but wait, 488 is included, so how many? Let me think differently. The first 8 is at 8, then every 10 after that. The last one is 488. So, the number of 8s in the units place is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since we only go up to 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks are there? From 1-400, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, right? Because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total eights in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recount the fours in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. Then, tens place: 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Units place: 49 fours. So, 89+50=139, plus 49 is 188. That seems right. For eights: units place, 49. Tens place: 49. So, 98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the tens place for eights would be 50, but it's 49 because the last set is only 9 numbers. Let me check that again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit):** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit):** 4 appears in 400-488. This range includes 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This totals 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The last set has 9 numbers, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last).

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 have the tens digit as 8? Yes, but since the book only goes up to 488, the tens digit 8 in 480-488 is still present. So, each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place.

Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours. Let me recount the fours: units place: from 4,14,...484. How many? The formula is floor(488/10) + 1 if the last number is included. 488/10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, plus 1 if 484 is included. Since 484 is 4*100 + 84, so yes, it's included. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units place: 8,18,...488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4 +9=49. So, 49+49=98. Therefore, 188-98=90.

The first term is 8, and the last term is 488. The sequence is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1 = 48, so n = 49.

So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so units digit 8 occurs 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Wait, I think I made a mistake in the units place. When I counted from 4, 14, ..., 484, I thought it was 49 numbers, but let me verify. The formula for the number of times a digit appears in the units place up to N is floor((N + 1)/10). So, for N=488, units digit 4's: floor((488 +1)/10) = floor(489/10) = 48. So, that's 48 fours in the units place, not 49. So, I was wrong earlier. So, units place: 48 fours. Then, tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, so from 1-400, that's 4 sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit can also be 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's correct. So, tens place: 50 fours. Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 48+50=98, plus 89 is 187. Wait, that's different from my earlier count. I think I need to be more precise. Let me try a different approach. For each digit position, calculate the number of times 4 appears. **Units place:** For each complete set of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing 1 four, so 48 fours. Then, check if the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include a 4 in the units place. 484 is within this range, so that's one more, making it 49 fours in the units place. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me use the formula: The number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is floor((N + 1)/10). So, for d=4, N=488: floor((488 +1)/10) = floor(489/10) = 48. So, 48 fours in the units place. **Tens place:** Similarly, the number of times 4 appears in the tens place is calculated by looking at each hundred. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 ten times. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. How many complete hundreds are there up to 488? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, check the last partial hundred, 401-488. In this range, the tens digit is 0-8, so 4 appears in the tens place for 40-49 in this hundred, which is 10 numbers (400-409, but wait, 400 is the start of the next hundred. Wait, actually, 400-488 is the hundreds place being 4, so the tens digit in this range can be 0-8. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 fours in the tens place. So, total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488. That's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. **Units place for 8's:** Using the same formula, floor((488 +1)/10) = 48. So, 48 eights in the units place. **Tens place for 8's:** In each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 complete hundreds, so 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 9 numbers: 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. **Hundreds place for 8's:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97. Now, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 187 - 97 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 187. For eights: units 48, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 97. So, 187 - 97 = 90. Hmm, but I'm not sure if I counted correctly. Let me check the tens place for eights again. In the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 eights in the tens place. So, 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 = 49. That seems correct. Similarly, for fours in the tens place, in the last partial hundred, 400-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, 40 +10=50. That seems correct. Units place for fours: 48, because floor(488+1)/10=48.9, floor is 48. Wait, but when I think about it, from 1-488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours. But wait, 488 is the last number, so 488 has an 8 in the units place, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 fours in the units place. Similarly, for eights, the last occurrence in the units place is 488, which is the 48th eight. So, units place for both is 48. So, that seems correct. So, total fours: 48 +50 +89=187. Eights:48 +49=97. So, 187-97=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be different. Let me check another way. Alternatively, I can count the number of fours and eights in each position separately.\n\nFirst, for fours:\n\n- Units place: As calculated, 48.\n- Tens place: 50.\n- Hundreds place:89.\nTotal:187.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units place:48.\n- Tens place:49.\n- Hundreds place:0.\nTotal:97.\n\nDifference:187-97=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 48 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n3. **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 48 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n3. **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences (since the book ends at 488).\n\nTotal 8's = 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Let's count how many full sets there are. Each 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last, so 480-488 is 9 numbers). So, total eights in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80s, 180s, 280s, 380s) = 40, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98.

How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's see: Each block from 80-89, 180-189, etc., has 10 numbers. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 5 blocks, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, 4 full blocks (each with 10 eights in the tens place) and the last block with 9. So, 4*10 = 40, plus 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, no, because 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9. So, 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 eights, and the last block 480-488 contributing 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49+49=98. But wait, when I counted the tens place, I got 49, but let me double-check. For the tens place, each block of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place, except the last block which has 9. So, from 1-400: 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488: the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 40+9=49. So, total eights: units 49 + tens 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's was 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me just cross-verify. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 fours. Then, in the tens place, 50 fours (from 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and in the units place, 49 fours. So, 89+50+49=188. For 8's, units place: 49, tens place:49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for 4's. For the tens digit being 4, it's 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 5*10=50. That's correct. For the units digit, 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so from 4 to 484, that's (484-4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. For hundreds digit, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units digit: 8,18,...,488. 488 is the 49th term because (488-8)/10 +1=48+1=49. Tens digit: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers, so 40+9=49. So, 49 in tens place. So, total 8's: 49+49=98. Thus, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, how many 8's in the units place? From 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me calculate: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full tens, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then the 49th occurrence is 488. So, that's 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, each block from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks, but the last one has 9 numbers instead of 10. So, how many eights in the tens place? For the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributes 10 eights in the tens place. The last block, 480-488, contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but since the book goes up to 488, that set is only up to 488. Let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10, because 488 is the last page. So, total eights in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Hmm, wait, let me check that again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40 plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49 + 49 = 98. Hmm, but let me double-check the tens place. For the tens place, we have 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours. Let me recount the fours: units place: 49, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct.

Now, adding up the fours from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last occurrence in the units place is 488. Let me calculate how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first occurrence is 8, then every 10 numbers. So, the number of 8's in the units place is the number of times 8 appears from 1 to 488 in the units place. The last number is 488, so how many numbers is that? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488. Let me count: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the range. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9. So total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights from each place: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but we need to check if 488 is included. 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8*1 =8, 8*2=16, ..., 8*49=392, but wait, 8*50=400, which is beyond 488. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, let me think again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so the number of 8's in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8, and then the 49th group is from 480-488, which includes 488. So, in the units place, we have 48 +1 =49 eights. Wait, but that might not be accurate. Let me think differently. The number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to the number of times 8 is the last digit. So, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? It's an arithmetic sequence where a1=8, d=10, an=488. The nth term is given by a_n = a1 + (n-1)d. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 8: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n-1. So, n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book goes only up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Each of these blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except possibly the last one if it's cut short. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers? Wait, 488 - 480 = 8, but inclusive, so 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, each full block (like 80-89) contributes 10 eights, and the last block 480-488 contributes 9 eights. So, how many full blocks are there? From 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's 4 blocks, each with 10 eights. Then, the last block 480-488 has 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the tens place calculation. When I have 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. That's 4 full blocks and a partial block. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. So total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Now, the fours were 188, and the eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, from 4, 14, ..., 484.

Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.

So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place.

Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in numbers 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8 to 488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   \nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, the hundreds place has 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll check each place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many times. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks up to 440-449.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block (480-488) which has 9.\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but since the book goes up to 488, 480-488 is included. So, each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks: 1-100: 80-89 (10), 101-200:180-189 (10), 201-300:280-289 (10), 301-400:380-389 (10), and 401-488:480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total eights are units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 480-488, the tens digit is 8, and that's 9 numbers, right? So, yes, 49 in the tens place. So, total eights are 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8. Let me check how many numbers that is. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1 =9). Wait, that's 9 instead of 10 because we stop at 488. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98.
