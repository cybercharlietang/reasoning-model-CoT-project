    "text": " So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is 488. Let's count how many. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48 full tens, but 488 is included, so it's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Let me check: Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the book.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 89 numbers. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let's do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 numbers where 8 is in the units place (from 8 to 488). Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets do we have? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, which is 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800 or above, but our book goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units place: 4,14,...,484: that's 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 gives 49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each set is 10 numbers, and there are 5 sets, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. Correct. So 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 10*4 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total eights: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers? 488 - 400 +1 =89. So that's correct. Hmm, so the difference is 90. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Another way to think about it is to consider each digit place separately and calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each place. Let me try that approach again, just to confirm. **Counting 4's:**\n- Units place: For every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. From 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. So, 488 /10 =48.8, so 49 times in the units place.\n- Tens place: For every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). So, from 1-488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. Each complete hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8, so the tens digit 4 appears from 401-410, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 401-410 is 10 numbers, but 410 is included, so that's 10 fours. So total tens place fours: 40 +10=50.\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, as before, that's 89 fours.\n\nSo, 49 +50 +89=188 fours.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- Units place: Same as before, 49 eights.\n- Tens place: For every 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. From 1-488, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8, so 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 40 +9=49 eights in the tens place.\n- Hundreds place: 0 eights.\n\nSo, 49 +49=98 eights.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm getting 90, but I feel like maybe I'm overcounting somewhere. Let me check if in the hundreds place for fours, I'm correct. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. For eights, in the hundreds place, none, correct.\n\nAnother way: maybe using a formula for digit counting. The number of times a digit d appears in position p (units, tens, hundreds) can be calculated as:\n\nFor units place: (n + 1) * (d / 10), but I think I might have to adjust for the remainder.\n\nWait, perhaps a better formula is:\n\nFor a given digit position (units, tens, hundreds), the count of digit d in that position from 1 to n can be calculated as:\n\nhigher = n divided by (position * 10)\ncurrent = (n divided by position) mod 10\nlower = n mod position\n\nif current > d: count += (higher +1) * position\nif current == d: count += higher * position + lower +1\nif current < d: count += higher * position\n\nBut maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of how many times each digit appears in each place.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use this approach:\n\nFor each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- Units place for 4: Every 10 numbers, so 488 /10 =48.8, so 49 times.\n- Units place for 8: Similarly, 49 times.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Tens place for 4: Each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4, so 4 hundreds give 4*10=40. Plus, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 401-410, which is 10 numbers, so total 50.\n- Tens place for 8: Each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 8, so 4*10=40. In the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so total 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- Hundreds place for 4: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n- Hundreds place for 8: None, as the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nI think this is correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449, totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n  \nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488, totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in any page number up to 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,...,484: how many? The formula is (last number - first number)/step + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. That's correct. Tens place: Each hundred block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the formula: (488 -8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be next, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488).

So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that's 49+49=98. So, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.

So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but including 488, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, that's the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's calculate how many numbers have 8 in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, but let me double-check. Units place: 8,18,...,488. How many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10*4 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So, total eights: 49+49=98. Now, the number of fours was 188, and the number of eights was 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as pages go up to 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 - 8 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, so there are 49 numbers (since 8 is the first and 488 is the 49th). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

For 480-488, that's 488 - 480 +1 = 9 numbers, right? So, yes, 9 eights in the tens place for that block. So, total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours and eights. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, plus 89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right.

So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is included, so how many? Let me calculate. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the book. Let me count each block. - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: how many? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 eights in the tens place here. So total in tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that can't be right because 188-98 is 90, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through the 4's again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. That's correct. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89. Total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Now for 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. Number of terms: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So total 8's: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm getting 90, but I thought maybe I was wrong. Let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. Correct. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's, 49 in units, 49 in tens, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, it's easy to make an off-by-one error. Let me verify the units place for 4's. From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, (n-1)*10=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. Correct. Similarly, for 8's in units place, from 8 to 488, same calculation: 49 terms. Now, for 8's in tens place: 80-89: 10 numbers, correct. 180-189: 10, correct. 280-289:10, correct. 380-389:10, correct. 480-488: 488-480+1=9 numbers, correct. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 400 is the first, 488 is the last. The count is 488 - 400 +1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Correct. So, yes, 89. So, 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, 188-98=90.

So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as the book ends at 488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last occurrence is 488. How many numbers is that? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The first is 8 (which is 8), and the last is 488. The number of terms can be calculated as (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count each block. Each full block (like 80-89) has 10 numbers, so 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers. So, the total number of eights in the tens place is 4 full blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 from 480-488. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me double-check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Checking fours: units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, how many numbers? (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, and there are 5 blocks, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. Correct. Now for eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks is 10, and the last is 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that in the hundreds place for fours, I counted up to 488, which is correct, but for eights, in the tens place, I considered 480-488, which is correct because 488 is the last page. So, yes, that's 9 numbers.

    "text": " Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let's do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48, but wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8 in the tens place, right? Because 480 has 8 in the tens place, and so does 481, up to 488. So, how many sets do we have? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me double-check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding up the eights in each place: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Wait, that can't be right because 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4 appears every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many times? The number of times 4 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) + 1 if 488 mod 10 is >=4. Wait, 488/10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, and 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so add 1, making it 49. That's correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 1-488, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50. That's correct. Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times? floor(488/10) = 48, and since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=8, so add 1, making it 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Each full hundred (like 80-89) has 10 eights in the tens place. How many full hundreds are there? From 1-488, the hundreds are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488. So, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, the first four sets contribute 10 each, so 4*10=40, and the last set contributes 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, but wait a second, let me double-check the tens place. For the tens digit 8, in each hundred block, it's 10 numbers. So, in 1-100: 80-89, 10 numbers. 101-200: 180-189, 10. 201-300: 280-289, 10. 301-400: 380-389, 10. Then, 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. That's correct. So, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours. Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yes. Eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, which is 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Let's count each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last, so 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers)\n\nSo, adding these up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nAdding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights.\n\nWait, let me double-check the tens place for 8's. For 480-488, that's 9 numbers, right? 480, 481, ..., 488. So that's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place for that block. So total tens place is 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems right.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, I think I accounted for all the possible sets correctly.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This totals 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 is the last page. So, starting at 8, each 10 numbers adds another 8 in the units place. The last number is 488, which is 488 - 8 = 480, so 480/10 = 48, but including 8, that's 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of it. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-489: but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, for the first four blocks, it's 4 sets of 10, which is 40. Then, the last block is 9 numbers. So total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences (4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences (8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Wait, let me check that addition again. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Yes, that seems right. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let me do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, that's correct. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except possibly the last block. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place for the last block. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, so 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits with 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Wait, let me check: units 49, tens 49, so total 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " So, in the hundreds place, there are 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds place is only 489 numbers? Wait, no, the hundreds place for 4 is from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 numbers where the units digit is 8. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Each full set (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, so let's count them. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98 eights. Now, subtracting the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, when I counted the tens place for fours, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. But from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's correct, 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nFor the units place, 4 appears 49 times because from 4,14,...,484, which is 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 gives 48, but since we include both endpoints, it's 49. So, 49 fours in the units place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor the eights, units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is the 49th term because (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49.\n\nTens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0, since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal eights: 49 +49=98.\n\nSo, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.\n\nWait, that's 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, but let me check if I counted correctly. Another way to approach this is to consider each digit position separately for both digits.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a systematic way to count the digits. Let me try that.\n\nFor any digit position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times a digit d appears can be calculated by:\n\n- For units place: For every 10 numbers, d appears once. So, total occurrences = floor(488 /10) = 48, but since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, we add 1 more. Wait, no, that's for a specific digit. Wait, perhaps it's better to think as:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is:\n\nunits = (n // 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, for each digit position, the count can be calculated as:\n\ncount = higher * current_base + (lower + 1) if current digit > d, else higher * current_base + lower if current digit == d, else higher * current_base + (lower + 1)\n\nWait, maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, for each digit position, we can break down the number into higher, current, and lower parts.\n\nBut perhaps for this problem, since the numbers are manageable, my initial counting is correct.\n\nWait, let me recheck the fours:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. That's 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. Wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers.\n\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, plus 1 is 49.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal eights: 49+49=98.\n\nThus, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because when I first thought about it, I thought maybe the hundreds place for fours was 89, but let me check: from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place in fours, 5 sets of 10, each contributing a 4 in the tens place, so 50.\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nSo, total fours: 188.\n\nEights: 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, total 98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I remember sometimes when counting digits, you have to be careful about overlapping or not double-counting, but in this case, each digit position is independent, so I think it's okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\n\nFor each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), count the number of 4's and 8's separately, then sum them up.\n\nSo, for units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so add 1, total 49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's: floor(488/10)=48, and 488 mod 10=8, which is equal to 8, so add 1, total 49.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100) = 4, but wait, that's not the right approach. Wait, for the tens place, each cycle is 100 numbers, and in each cycle, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49), so the number of cycles is floor(488 / 100) = 4 full cycles (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial cycle (401-488), the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total fours in tens place: 40 + 10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in tens place: floor(488/100)=4 full cycles, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place (80-89, etc.), so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial cycle (401-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, eights in tens place: 40 +9=49.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/1000)=0 full cycles, but since 400-488 is within the book, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers (400-488), so 89 fours.\n\nNumber of 8's: hundreds digit is 8 would be 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\nFours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 188.\n\nEights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more 4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. \n\nTo determine this, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each block of 100 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n   - Number of occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each block of 100 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but let's check: 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers because 488 is included.

    "text": " So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's the 8th in the 49th set. Wait, no, 488 is the 49th number because 8,18,...,488. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many full sets we have. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, as 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, total tens place eights: 10 +10+10+10+9=49. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, each of the next three centuries (180-189, etc.) is 10 each, so 10*4=40, plus 480-488 is 9, so total 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that can't be right because I think I might have made a mistake in counting the units place for fours. Let me double-check the fours count. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. That's correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: Units: 8,18,...,488. How many? Let's use the same formula. (488-8)/10 +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, but 400-488 inclusive is 89 numbers, right? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So that's correct. So, the total fours are 188, eights are 98, so the difference is 90. But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be different. Let me check another way. Alternatively, I can calculate the number of fours and eights in each digit position again to confirm. For fours: Units: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total:188. For eights: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total:98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, especially in the tens place, I might have missed something. Let me check the tens place for eights again. From 80-89:10 eights in tens place. Then 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9 is 49. Correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of '4's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** '4' appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** '4' appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** '4' appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of '8's:**\n   - **Units place:** '8' appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** '8' appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. This totals 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with '8' in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - More '4's than '8's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of '4's printed exceeds the number of '8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1 four, which is 48, plus the 4 in 484, making it 49. That seems correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place. How many hundreds are there? From 0-99: 10 fours, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488: here, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, etc., up to 480-489. Wait, but the book stops at 488, so from 400-488, how many times does the tens digit equal 4? It's from 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, let me recalculate the tens place. For each hundred block, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, in 0-99: 10 fours in the tens place. In 100-199: another 10. Similarly, 200-299:10, 300-399:10. Now, in 400-488: how many times does the tens digit equal 4? The tens digit cycles every 100. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, and also for 400-409, 410-419, etc., up to 480-489. But wait, 400-409 is 10 numbers, 410-419 another 10, and so on. Wait, but 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. So, how many sets of 10 are there? From 400-488, the tens digit cycles every 10. So, 400-409:10, 410-419:10, ..., 480-488:9. So, that's 9 sets of 10, but wait, 400-409 is the first set, then 410-419, etc., up to 480-488. How many sets? Let's see: 400-409 (10), 410-419 (10), 420-429 (10), 430-439 (10), 440-449 (10), 450-459 (10), 460-469 (10), 470-479 (10), and 480-488 (9). Wait, that's 9 sets, but from 400-488, the tens digit cycles every 10, so the number of times the tens digit is 4 is 9 times 10, but the last set only has 9 numbers. So, total tens digits of 4 in 400-488 would be 9*10 + 9? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, let's think differently. From 400-488, the number of numbers where the tens digit is 4 is the same as in each hundred block, which is 10 per hundred. But 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so how many full tens blocks are there? From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last). So, the tens digit is 4 when the tens part is 4, which occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 400-409 is also tens digit 0, so no, I think I'm getting confused. Maybe a better approach is to calculate the number of times the tens digit is 4 in the entire range 1-488. Each hundred block (0-99, 100-199, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, for 0-99: 10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, that's correct. So, the tens place contributes 50 fours. Now, hundreds place: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, which is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing an 8 in the units place, which is 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 0-99: 10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, and 400-488: here, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, total tens digits of 8: 4 sets of 10 (from 0-399) plus 9 from 400-488, totaling 49. Wait, let me check: 0-99:10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, and 400-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place contributes 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89, total=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0, total=98. Difference=188-98=90. Hmm, that seems right. I think I did it correctly.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

I'll do the same for the 8's, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's see: Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me double-check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9 (since 488 is included). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights in total. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Wait, when I calculated the tens place, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, but actually, from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, yes, that's 9. So, 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, totaling 49. So, 49 in the tens place. So, total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Wait, but wait, let me think again about the units place. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? The first 8 is at 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many terms are in this sequence? It's an arithmetic sequence starting at 8, ending at 488, with a common difference of 10. The number of terms can be calculated as ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, yes, 49 eights in the units place. Similarly, for the tens place, we have 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 4*10 +9=49. So, total eights are 49 +49=98. Now, the fours were 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, when counting the fours in the hundreds place, I said from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. That seems correct. For the tens place, 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 blocks of 10, so 50 fours. Units place, 49 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights, units place:49, tens place:49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any cases. For example, in the hundreds place, for fours, it's 400-488, which is correct. For eights, there are no hundreds digits of 8, so that's correct. For the tens place, I think I covered all possible blocks where the tens digit is 8. Similarly, for units place, I think that's correct. So, I think the difference is 90. But wait, let me recount the eights in the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, 49 in tens, 49 in units, total 98 eights. Fours: 49 units, 50 tens, 89 hundreds, total 188. So, 188-98=90.

Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? 488 - 8 = 480, but since we're including both endpoints, we add 1: 480 +1=481. But wait, that's not right because we're counting every 10 numbers. Alternatively, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is the same as the number of complete decades in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit is 8, which is the 49th occurrence.

Let me check: 480 has 8 in the tens place, 481 has 8, ..., 488 has 8. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1=9). So, each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last block which is only 9 because the book ends at 488. So, how many complete blocks? Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9.

Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours in total. Okay, that's the number of 4's. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is 488, which is the 49th number because 488 - 8 = 480, and 480 / 10 = 48, so 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book goes only up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1 = 9). So, adding those up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights in total. Wait, that seems off. Let me double-check the tens place for 8's. When the tens digit is 8, the numbers are from 80-89, which is 10 numbers, then 180-189, another 10, 280-289, another 10, 380-389, another 10, and 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49, that's correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Let me find how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that would be 49 numbers. Let me check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 count? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 would have 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Let me break it down: - 80-89: 10 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: 9 numbers. So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So yes, 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, does 488 count? Yes, because 488 is included. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. To find how many, I can take (488 - 8)/10 + 1. That's (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count each set: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9 =49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49 =98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 =90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me check the tens place for fours again. I thought from 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. That seems right. And for hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? Let's see: 484 is the last one. So, 484-4=480. 480/10=48, but since we include both endpoints, it's 48+1=49. So, that's correct. For eights: units place, 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, plus 1 is 49. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, that's correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of that.

So, the first four blocks give 10 each, which is 40, and the last block gives 9, so total 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Wait, that seems a bit low. Let me check again. Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 49 eights. Hundreds place: 0. So total eights: 98. Now, the number of fours was 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me cross-verify my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours. Units place: from 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 488-400+1=89. Correct. So 49+50+89=188. Now, eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488. So, (488 -8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So total eights: 49+49=98. So, difference is 188 -98=90.

Let me double-check. For the units place, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which we take the integer part as 48, but since 488 is included, we add 1, making it 49. That seems correct. For the tens place, each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. From 1-488, there are 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40. But wait, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, but the tens digit in 400-488 is 0-8, so the tens digit 4 in this range would be from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, actually, it's 4 sets (1-400) with 10 each, plus another 10 in 440-449, making 5*10=50. That seems correct. For the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence (since 488-8=480, 480/10=48, plus 1 is 49). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8's in the tens place occur in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Each hundred has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. From 1-488, how many hundreds? 4 full hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, so that's 9 more. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 40+9=49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, so that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 4*10=40 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for eights. Let me recount the tens place for eights. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in the following ranges: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, eights in tens place:49. So, total eights:49+49=98. Fours:188. So, 188-98=90.

Similarly, 100-199: 140-149, another 10. 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers (440-449). So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. So, tens place is 50. Units place: In each 10 numbers, there's one 4 in the units place. So, from 1-488, how many tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. But wait, the last partial set is 480-488, which includes 484, so that's 9 more numbers, but only one 4 in the units place (484). So, units place total is 48 (from 1-480) plus 1 (484), totaling 49. So, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488. So, each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers? Wait, 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the tens place in 480-488 is 8 for 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Number of 4's:  \n     From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (4, 14, ..., 484).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   - Number of 4's:  \n     There are 5 sets of 10 numbers each (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), totaling 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.  \n   - Number of 4's:  \n     From 400 to 488, there are 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Number of 8's:  \n     From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (8, 18, ..., 488).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   - Number of 8's:  \n     There are 4 full sets of 10 numbers each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and 9 additional numbers in 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.  \n   - Number of 8's: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference between the number of 4's and 8's:**  \n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but we need to check if 488 is included. Since 488 is an 8 in the units place, that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 is included). Let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, total eights in the tens place are 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, is that right? Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40 plus 9 is 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights from each place: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " Each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, let me add them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours in total. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The formula is floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10) = 48.9, which is 48 full tens, but since 484 is included, it's 48 + 1 = 49. So that's correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. Wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440 is included in 400-488, so that's 5 sets of 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The last number is 488, which is 488. So, the count is floor(488/10) + 1 if 488 is included. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. Then, since 488 is the 49th occurrence (8,18,...,488). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. Let me count each block. Each full block like 80-89, 180-189, etc., has 10 numbers. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488: how many numbers? 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, that's 9 numbers. So total tens place eights: 4 full blocks (80-89, etc.) = 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that seems a bit off because in the tens place, I had 49 eights, but let me check again. Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So yes, 49 in the tens place. So total eights: 49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

Let's see how many that is. Starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one more 8. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? The first number is 8 (which is 8 + 0*10), then 18 (8 + 1*10), up to 488 (8 + 48*10). So, that's 49 numbers (since 488 is the 49th term). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189:10 - 280-289:10 - 380-389:10 - 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last one, so 480 to 488 is 9 numbers).

So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? The formula is ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1.

Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8 in this book. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract 98 from 188: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems too high. Let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems like a big difference. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in counting the number of 4's or 8's. Let me go back. For the 4's: Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, inclusive, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, that's correct. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? So, that's 5 sets of 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. Now, for the 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. Number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, I feel like maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems right. But wait, let me think about the hundreds place for 8's. Since the book only goes up to 488, there are no pages with 800 or above, so no 8's in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. So, 188 fours and 98 eights. The difference is 90. But I'm a bit unsure because I thought maybe the answer would be lower, but maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, from 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers? It's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, that's correct. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, the total is indeed 188 fours and 98 eights.

The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), so let me check. Each full block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 40 eights. Now, the last block is 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the tens place, that's 9 eights. So total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. I think I did everything right, but let me check a few specific points. When counting the hundreds place for 4's, from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. That's correct. For the tens place of 4's, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. That's correct. For the units place of 4's, I had 49, which is correct because from 4 to 484, that's 48 intervals of 10, plus the last one, making 49. Similarly, for 8's, units place is 49, which is correct. Tens place: 4 full sets (80-89, etc.) each contributing 10, so 40, and then 480-488 contributing 9, so 49. So, that's correct. So, yes, the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, so 5\u00d710 = 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 4\u00d710 = 40, and 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
