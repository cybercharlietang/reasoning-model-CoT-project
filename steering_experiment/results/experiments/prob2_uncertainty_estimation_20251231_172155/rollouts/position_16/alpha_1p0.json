    "text": " Let me check. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in each block of 10, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the number of 4's in the units place would be the number of complete blocks of 10. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, that means there are 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last block is 481-490, but since the book ends at 488, the last 4 in the units place is at 484. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each number here has 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up the 4's: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's are 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? It's the same as the number of complete blocks of 10. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 48 numbers. Let me check: 8,18,...,488. Yes, that's 49 numbers because from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Oh, I made a mistake earlier. So, actually, it's 49 times. Because the first term is 8 (which is 8 + 10*0), and the last term is 488 (which is 8 + 10*48). So, the number of terms is 49. So, units place contributes 49 8's. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each range contributes 10 numbers. Let's see how many such ranges exist within 1-488. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. So, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, so the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, but how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (including both ends). So, in the hundreds place 4, the tens digit 8 contributes 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0. Now, adding up the 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for 4's. Let me check again. When counting the tens place for 4's, I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 is correct. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 ranges, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9, totaling 49. So, that's correct. So, 4's: 187, 8's:98. Difference is 89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484)\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449)\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488)\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = **187**\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488)\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488)\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **89**\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Let me think. The first 4 in the units place is at 4 (which is the 4th number), then every 10 numbers after that. So from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let me calculate it as follows: The total number of units places is 488. For every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction, we take 48 full times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the 488th page, so 488 is included. Let me check: The last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 484th page. So from 4 to 484, that's 484 - 4 + 1 = 481 pages, but that's not the right way to count. Maybe a better way is to think that for each ten numbers, there's one 4 in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4. So 48 times. But wait, does 488 include a 4 in the units place? 488 ends with 8, so no. So the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 484th page. So that's 48 times. Wait, but 488 is 488, so the 48th set of 10 would be 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the 48th set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So in that set, the 4 in the units place is at 484. So yes, 48 times. So units place: 48 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. But wait, in the case of 440-449, we have to check if 449 is within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes. So how many such ranges are there? Let's see: The first is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 include 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers, yes. So total tens place fours: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So how many fours is that? 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So 89 fours. Now, let me add up all the fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So total fours: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers. So from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times 8 appears in the units place. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8. So 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So does that mean 49 times? Wait, let me think. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. So the number of such numbers is equal to the number of times 8 appears in the units place. Let me calculate it as (488 - 8)/10 + 1. So (488-8)=480, 480/10=48, +1=49. So 49 times. So units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's check how many such ranges are there up to 488. The first is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189 (another 10), 280-289 (another 10), 380-389 (another 10). Now, 480-489 would be another range, but since the book only goes up to 488, the range 480-488 includes 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 only in 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, does that affect the count? Wait, no. Because in the tens place, 480-488 has the tens digit as 8, but the units digit varies. So the tens digit is 8 for all numbers from 480 to 489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So does that count as a full 10? No, it's 9 numbers. So how many full ranges do we have? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo that's 4 full ranges of 10, contributing 4*10=40, plus 9 in the last partial range. So total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. From 80-89: 10 eights in the tens place. Similarly for 180-189, etc. But 480-488 is only 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 eights in the tens place. So total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, the hundreds place has zero eights.\n\nSo total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier I thought the hundreds place for 8 would be zero, but let me check again. Since the book is 488 pages, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3, or 4. So 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So yes, hundreds place eights: 0.\n\nSo total eights: 49 +49=98.\n\nWait, but earlier for fours, I had 187 fours, and for eights, 98 eights. So the difference would be 187 -98=89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLet me recount the fours:\n\n- Units place: 48 fours\n- Tens place: 50 fours\n- Hundreds place: 89 fours\nTotal: 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct.\n\nEights:\n\n- Units place: 49 eights\n- Tens place: 49 eights\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49+49=98.\n\nSo the difference is 187 -98=89.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for fours. I had 5 ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\nFor eights in the tens place, I had 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 4*10=40, plus the 480-488 range contributing 9, so 40+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the units place for eights, I had 49 eights. Let me check that again. The last page is 488, which ends with 8, so the units digit 8 appears at 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms are there in this sequence?\n\nThe sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. This is an arithmetic sequence with first term 8, common difference 10, last term 488.\n\nThe nth term is given by a_n = a_1 + (n-1)*d.\n\nSo 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10\n\n488-8=480=(n-1)*10\n\n480/10=48=n-1\n\nn=49.\n\nSo yes, 49 terms, so 49 eights in the units place. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for fours in the units place, the last term would be 484, which is 484=4 + (n-1)*10\n\n484-4=480=(n-1)*10\n\nn-1=48\n\nn=49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Let me check.\n\nWait, if I use the same formula for fours in the units place: 4,14,24,...,484.\n\nSo a_1=4, d=10, a_n=484.\n\nSo 484=4 + (n-1)*10\n\n484-4=480=(n-1)*10\n\nn-1=48\n\nn=49.\n\nSo that's 49 fours in the units place. But earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, so if that's the case, then fours in the units place are 49, not 48. That changes things.\n\nWait, let me go back. So for fours in the units place, from 4 to 484, how many numbers? Using the formula, it's 49. So earlier I thought it was 48, but that's incorrect. It should be 49.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in the units place, it's 49.\n\nSo let's correct that.\n\nFours:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nEights:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nSo the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 187 fours and 98 eights, difference 89, but now I see that the units place for fours is actually 49, not 48, which makes the total fours 188, and eights 98, so difference 90.\n\nWait, let me make sure. Let's recount the fours in the units place.\n\nFrom 4 to 484, stepping by 10: 4,14,24,...,484.\n\nNumber of terms: ((484 -4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49.\n\nSo yes, 49 fours in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, eights in the units place: 8,18,...,488, which is 49 numbers.\n\nSo fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=49+50=99+89=188.\n\nEights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98.\n\nSo the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the hundreds place for fours was 89. Let me check that.\n\nHundreds place for fours: numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that?\n\n488 -400 +1=89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. Correct.\n\nSo the total fours are 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nEights: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm getting conflicting results because earlier I thought the units place for fours was 48, but now it's 49.\n\nI think the correct count is 49 fours in the units place, leading to a total of 188 fours and 98 eights, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can write a small program or use another method to verify.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of fours and eights in each digit place separately.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units place: As above, 49.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49:10 numbers, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 50 fours.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488:89 numbers, each contributing one four.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units place:8,18,...,488:49 numbers.\n\n- Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 4 full ranges (10 each) and one partial range (9). So 4*10 +9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place:0.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nSo difference:188-98=90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I initially thought it was 89, but after correcting the units place for fours, it's 90.\n\nLet me think again. The units place for fours: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. How many terms? 4,14,...,484.\n\nThe number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1=48+1=49. So 49 fours in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, eights in the units place:8,18,...,488. Number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1=48+1=49.\n\nSo units place: both have 49.\n\nTens place: fours have 50, eights have 49.\n\nHundreds place: fours have 89, eights have 0.\n\nSo fours total:49+50+89=188.\n\nEights total:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me check: 4,14,24,...,484. That's 49 numbers because starting from 4, each step is +10. So, 484 is the 49th term. So, units place has 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each number here has a hundreds digit of 4. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many such numbers. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each range has 10 numbers. Let's count the ranges: From 0-99: 80-89 is one. From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: There's no 480-489 because the book ends at 488, so 480-488 would be 9 numbers, but since we're looking for tens digit 8, it's 480-489, but 488 is the last page. So, from 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, how many ranges? Let's see: 0-99: 1 range (80-89), 100-199: 1, 200-299:1, 300-399:1, and 400-488:1 (but only 9 numbers). So, total ranges: 5, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, total eights in tens place: 4 ranges *10 + 9 = 49. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. Each range except the last has 10 eights. The last range (480-488) has 9 eights because 488 is the last page. So, from 0-399, there are 4 ranges, each contributing 10 eights: 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total eights in tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98 eights. Now, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me check: from 4 to 484, how many numbers with 4 in the units place? The formula would be floor((488 - 4)/10) + 1. So, (488 - 4) is 484, divided by 10 is 48.4, floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where 4 is in the tens place. Let's see how many complete blocks there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? Let me check: 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, let me make sure. 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5*10=50. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, actually, each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, 401, ..., up to 488. So yes, 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many. The first is 8, last is 488. So, using the same formula: floor((488 - 8)/10) +1 = floor(480/10) +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block is 10 numbers. Let's see how many blocks there are. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-489 would be another block, but since the book only goes up to 488, we need to check how many numbers in 480-488 have 8 in the tens place. 480-488: the tens digit is 8, so numbers 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, instead of a full block of 10, we have 9. So, total in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial block of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10=40 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total 8's:98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) -98 (8's) =90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. But let me check: 400 is included, 488 is included. So, 488-400+1=89. Correct. For 8's in the tens place, I had 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial block 480-488. Each full block is 10, so 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, total 49. Correct. So, 4's:188, 8's:98, difference 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Because 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4. Let me check: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms can be calculated as (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, that's another 10, and so on. Since the book goes up to 488, the last block would be 440-449. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: from 40-49 (40s), 140-149 (140s), 240-249 (240s), 340-349 (340s), and 440-449 (440s). That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so all 5 blocks are fully included. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. Each number here has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. Let's count how many such blocks are there. The first block is 80-89, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 4 x 10 = 40. Wait, but does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? Yes, 480-489, but 488 is the last page. So, 480-488 is part of this block. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers here. So, the total number of 8's in the tens place would be 4 blocks x 10 = 40, plus 9 more from 480-488. Wait, but 480-489 is a full block, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 9 numbers. So, 4 blocks of 10 and one partial block of 9. So, total 40 + 9 = 49. But wait, let me think again. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8 in the 480s. So, how many 8's in the tens place? Each full block (80-89, etc.) contributes 10, and the last partial block (480-488) contributes 9. So, 4 full blocks x 10 = 40, plus 9, totaling 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 to 899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Full blocks: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Partial block (480-488): 9 numbers.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Final Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so in the 488th page, the units digit is 8, not 4. So, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such ranges are there up to 488? Let's see: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Since 449 is less than 488, yes, it's valid. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that is. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence? Wait, no. Let's think: from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place. The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The nth term can be expressed as 8 + 10(n-1). We need the last term \u2264488. So, 8 + 10(n-1) \u2264488 \u2192 10(n-1) \u2264480 \u2192 n-1 \u226448 \u2192 n \u226449. So, n=49. So, there are 49 8's in the units place. Wait, but earlier I thought 488 is the last page, so 488 is included, so that's 49 times. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Now, let's see how many such ranges are there up to 488. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-489 would be another range, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, the 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and partially in 480-488. So, for each complete range (80-89, etc.), there are 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 complete ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 8's: 4*10=40. Then, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all numbers from 480 to 489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, in the tens place, we have 9 more 8's. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899. But since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought units place was 49, tens place 49, so total 98 8's. But let me double-check. For units place: numbers ending with 8 from 8 to 488. The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in units place. For tens place: as above, 4 full ranges (80-89, etc.) giving 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, but earlier when counting 4's, I had 187 4's. So, the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89. But wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, I think I made a mistake in counting the 4's in the tens place. Let me go back. When counting 4's in the tens place, I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's, so 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 50 in tens place. Units place: 48. Hundreds place: 89. So, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. So, 98. So, difference is 187 - 98 = 89. But wait, let me make sure I didn't double-count or miss anything. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. Let me check: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 +1 = 89). Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. That seems correct. For 8's in the hundreds place, none, correct. Now, let me check the 8's in the tens place again. 80-89: 10 numbers, each with 8 in tens place. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. Units place: 49. So, 49+49=98. So, the difference is 187-98=89. So, 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Total occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\) times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such ranges.  \n   - Total occurrences: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\) times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.  \n   - Total occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\) times.\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 \\) times.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Total occurrences: \\( \\left\\lceil \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rceil = 49 \\) times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   - Each complete range contributes 10 occurrences, with an additional 9 from 480-488.  \n   - Total occurrences: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\) times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Total occurrences: 0 times.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\) times.\n\n**Difference:**  \n\\( 187 \\text{ (4's)} - 98 \\text{ (8's)} = 89 \\).\n\n\\boxed{89}"

So, from 1 to 480, there are 480/10 = 48 occurrences, and then from 481 to 488, the units digit 4 appears once more at 484. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but 484 is within 488, so yes, that's correct. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which affects the tens digit. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? Let's see: from 0-99, there's 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199, 140-149 (10). From 200-299, 240-249 (10). From 300-399, 340-349 (10). From 400-488, 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place, which would be from 400-488. So, how many numbers here? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, no, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me check if that's correct. Wait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. In the tens place, each hundred block (like 0-99, 100-199, etc.) has a 40-49 block, which is 10 numbers. There are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only up to 488, so the 40-49 block in 400-488 would be 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. And in the units place, every 10 numbers, so 48 times up to 480, then one more at 484, making 49. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is included. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many numbers? From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full cycles, and then 8 more numbers (481-488). In each cycle, there's one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times, plus one more at 488, so 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so it's included. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers except possibly the last one, which might be shorter. Let's check each:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers.\n- 180-189: 10 numbers.\n- 280-289: 10 numbers.\n- 380-389: 10 numbers.\n- 480-488: Here, the tens digit is 8 for numbers 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 for all these, right? Because 480 is 4 8 0, 481 is 4 8 1, up to 488, which is 4 8 8. So, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, for the first four ranges, each contributes 10, and the last contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. The tens digit is 8 in the range 80-89, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, yes, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 can appear in the hundreds place. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. It can never be 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. So, zero occurrences in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. For the range 480-488, the tens digit is 8, right? So, numbers from 480 to 488: that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, that's correct, 49 in the tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier when I calculated 4's, I had 188. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many? From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then one more at 484, so 49.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 ranges, 10 each: 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 48 full cycles, plus one more at 488: 49.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 + 9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: none, since 800 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, 49 + 49=98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 - 98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused about the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check: 400-488 is 89 numbers because 488 - 400 +1=89. So, yes, that's correct. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nAnd for the tens place, 5 ranges each with 10, so 50. Units place, 49. So, 188 total.\n\nFor 8's, units and tens each have 49, so 98 total.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98=90.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the tens place for 8's, the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? So, that's correct. So, 49 in the tens place.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences (48 from 1 to 480 and one at 484).\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10 numbers. There are 5 such ranges, totaling 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in page numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences (48 from 1 to 480 and one at 488).\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The first four ranges each contribute 10 numbers, and the last range (480-488) contributes 9 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me check: from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1 to 488, the blocks are: 40-49 (1 block), 140-149 (2nd block), 240-249 (3rd), 340-349 (4th), and 440-449 (5th). Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times. But wait, 440-449 is up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. How many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many times? Let's calculate: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. The blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, 480-489 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times. But wait, 480-489 goes up to 489, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last number is 488. So, does that affect the count? Let's see: 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, the block 480-489 would only have 9 numbers in our case. So, instead of 10, it's 9. Therefore, the number of 8's in the tens place is 4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 1 block \u00d7 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, let me check again. The blocks are 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Number of 4's:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks of 100 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).  \n   - Number of blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n   - Each block contributes 10 4's.  \n   - Total:  \n     \\[\n     5 \\times 10 = 50\n     \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the range 400-488.  \n   - Number of numbers:  \n     \\[\n     488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n     \\]\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\[\n49 (\\text{units}) + 50 (\\text{tens}) + 89 (\\text{hundreds}) = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Number of 8's:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks of 100 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).  \n   - Number of blocks: 5 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488).  \n   - The block 480-488 has 9 numbers instead of 10.  \n   - Total:  \n     \\[\n     4 \\times 10 + 1 \\times 9 = 40 + 9 = 49\n     \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Number of 8's: 0\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\[\n49 (\\text{units}) + 49 (\\text{tens}) + 0 (\\text{hundreds}) = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference between the number of 4's and 8's:**  \n\\[\n188 - 98 = 90\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think. The first 4 in the units place is at 4, which is the 4th number. Then every 10 numbers after that. So from 4 to 484, how many steps of 10 are there? Let me calculate it as (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid, but 540-549 would be beyond 488, so we don't have that. So how many ranges is that? From 40-49 (40s), 140-149 (140s), 240-249 (240s), 340-349 (340s), and 440-449 (440s). That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So 5 * 10 = 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Wait, but the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, right? So from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? Let's see, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. Wait, but I'm only counting the hundreds place here, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. I'll go through each digit position again: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-489 would only go up to 488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Let me check each range. - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: 9 numbers. So, adding these up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me go back through each step. For 4's: units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. Correct. For 8's: units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. 49+49=98. Correct. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, which is correct because 488-400+1=89. And in each of those, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 4's. For the tens place of 4's: 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50. That seems right. Units place for 4's: from 4,14,...484, which is 49 numbers. So, yes, 49. For 8's: units place, same as 4's, 49. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, etc., but the last one is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, that's correct. So, 98 8's. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.

So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let me calculate it as follows: The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488, which is 48 full groups (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8), so 48 times.

So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.

From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers, but wait, does 440-449 fall within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 times. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 400-488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. That's from page 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the digit 8, checking each place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times. The first occurrence is at 8, the last is at 488. So, how many groups of 10 are there? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups. But wait, in the 48th group, which is 480-489, 488 is included, so the units digit 8 occurs at 488. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Let's count these. From 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Wait, does that affect the count? Let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the hundreds place, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, for the tens place: 4 ranges (80-89, etc.) each contributing 10, plus the last one contributing 9. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. Wait, but is that correct? Let me think again. From 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10. 100-199: 180-189 \u219210. 200-299:280-289\u219210. 300-399:380-389\u219210. 400-488:480-488\u21929. So, total is 4\u00d710 +9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, 97 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last range (480-488) contributes 9. Total: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 48 + 49 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me check. From 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Hmm, maybe I was wrong earlier. So, in the units place, 4 appears 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many such blocks there are. Each block is 10 numbers, so from 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, and so on. How many blocks are there? The hundreds digit goes from 0 to 4. When hundreds digit is 0, it's 40-49 (10 numbers). When hundreds digit is 1, it's 140-149 (10 numbers). Similarly, for 2, 3, and 4. So that's 5 blocks (0,1,2,3,4). Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, and then the next block would be 540-549, but 540 is beyond 488, so we don't have that. So, actually, we have 5 blocks, but wait, 0-4 in hundreds place. Wait, 0 is for pages 1-99, so 40-49 is within 1-99. Then 140-149 is within 100-199, and so on up to 440-449, which is within 400-488. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 count as 10 numbers? Yes, because 440, 441,...,449 are all valid page numbers. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, we're only counting the hundreds digit, which is 4 for all these numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, but the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but let's check if 488 is included. 8,18,...,488. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, each block is 10 numbers except possibly the last one. Let's count how many blocks: 0,1,2,3,4 in the hundreds place. So, 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. So, that's 5 blocks, but the last block is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9. So, total in the tens place is 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800 onwards, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.

    "text": " Let me think. From 4 to 484, each 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place. So, 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4, so that's 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, maybe I should calculate it differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last group is 480-488. In the units place, 484 is included, which is the 48th group plus 4, so yes, 48 times? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, for units place, the number of 4's is equal to the number of times 4 appears in the units digit from 1 to 488. So, for each ten numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the units digit cycles 0-9. So in each block of 10, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many such blocks are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But wait, the 49th block would be 481-490, but since the book ends at 488, we don't have the full 481-490 block. So, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which adds one more 4. So, total units place 4's: 48 (from full blocks) + 1 (from the partial block) = 49. Okay, that seems right.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. Let's think about how often that happens. The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there up to 488? Let's see:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, each of these contributes 10 4's in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? From 40-49 up to 440-449, that's 5 ranges. So, 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so all 10 numbers in 440-449 are included. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last occurrence is 488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many multiples of 10 plus 8 are there? The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. So, the number of such numbers is equal to the number of times 8 appears in the units place, which is the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is included, which is 48\u00d710 + 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, no: 8 is the first, 18 is the second, ..., 488 is the 49th. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, let me check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The formula is floor((488 - 8)/10) + 1. So, (488 - 8) = 480; 480/10 = 48; 48 + 1 = 49. So, yes, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is included, but 489 is not. So, how many ranges contribute to 8 in the tens place:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nSo, total in tens place: 4 ranges \u00d710 = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 49 times.\n\nWait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so in the tens place, we have 49. But let me double-check the tens place count.\n\nWait, 80-89: 10 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Then, 480-488: that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, yes, 49 in the tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 188 and 8's are 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49\nTens place: 50\nHundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 +89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49\nTens place: 49\nHundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 +49=98.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I thought about the tens place for 4's, I considered 440-449 as a full set, which is correct, but for 8's, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the tens place for 4's again. The ranges are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, the ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 ranges, but the last one is only 9 numbers, so 4\u00d710=40 plus 9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, the counts seem accurate. Therefore, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the units place for 4's. Let me check that again. The units place for 4's: from 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there?\n\nThe first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 -4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: from 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 + (n-1)*10=488. So, n-1=(488-8)/10=480/10=48, so n=49. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me check: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. Each step is 10, so the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers each time. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 480-489 would be beyond 488. Let me list the ranges: - 40-49: 10 numbers - 140-149: 10 numbers - 240-249: 10 numbers - 340-349: 10 numbers - 440-449: 10 numbers So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers each time: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Let me check each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189: 10 numbers - 280-289: 10 numbers - 380-389: 10 numbers - 480-488: 9 numbers So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For 4's: Units: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total 188. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total 98.

    "text": " Let me think. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full cycles of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in each cycle, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. Therefore, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 times 1, which is 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 have a 4 in the units place? No, because 488 is 4-8-8. So, the last occurrence of 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, there's a block where the tens digit is 4. How many hundreds do we have? 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, the blocks are 40-49 (1-100), 140-149 (100-200), 240-249 (200-300), 340-349 (300-400), and 440-449 (400-500). But since our book only goes up to 488, the last block is 440-449, which is entirely within 400-488. So, that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 blocks * 10 = 50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. Wait, but let me check the last block. 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, it's valid. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Wait, no, actually, each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4. So, that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. So, adding up the 4's: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 count? Yes, because it has an 8 in the units place. So, 488 is the 49th occurrence? Wait, let's think. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (1-480) and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So, in each cycle of 10, the units digit is 8 once. So, 48 times from 1-480, and then in 481-488, the units digit 8 occurs once (488). So, total is 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 can appear in the tens place. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, there's a block where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks? 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, 8 units. So, the blocks are 80-89 (1-100), 180-189 (100-200), 280-289 (200-300), 380-389 (300-400), and 480-488 (400-488). So, that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block, which only goes up to 488, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9. So, total in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 times. So, adding up the 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. Let's verify the counts again. For 4's: Units place: 48, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. Total: 187. For 8's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 49, Hundreds place: 0. Total: 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the units place for 4's. Let me check again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. The last one is 484, which is 48th occurrence because 484 /10 =48.4, so 48 times. So, that's correct. For the tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks *10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So, 48+50+89=187. For 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, the last block has 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484), totaling 48 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in page numbers 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n   \n   **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488), totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number, totaling 0 times.\n   \n   **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Let me check. The formula for the number of times a digit appears in the units place is floor((N + 9 - d)/10), where d is the digit we're looking for. So here, d=4, N=488. Plugging in: floor((488 + 9 - 4)/10) = floor(503/10) = 50.3, so 50 times. Wait, that seems different from my initial thought. Maybe I should approach it differently. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full cycles of 10, and then an extra 8 numbers. In each cycle of 10, 4 appears once in the units place. So 48 times. But wait, in the last partial cycle (481-488), does 484 fall into this? Yes, 484 is within 481-488, so that's another 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49? Hmm, maybe I'm confusing something. Alternatively, for each position, the number of times a digit appears can be calculated by considering higher digits. Let me try a better approach. For the units place, the number of 4's is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) times 1, plus any extra in the incomplete decade. 488 divided by 10 is 48 full decades, so 48 times, and then in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, that makes sense. 2. **Tens place:** Now, counting how many times 4 appears in the tens place. This happens in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So in each hundred, there's a 40-49 range. So how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 488 is in the 400-488 range. Wait, no, 400-488 is part of the fifth hundred. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the fifth hundred (400-488), how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? The range 440-449 has the tens digit 4, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So total tens place 4's: 4 * 10 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is part of the 400-499 range, but since our book ends at 488, 440-449 is fully included. So yes, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? This happens in numbers from 400-488. So the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, but wait, does the hundreds place count correctly? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So yes, 89. Okay, so total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to the 4's, it's every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. So 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, in the last partial cycle (481-488), 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place. So total units place 8's: 48 +1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** How many times does 8 appear in the tens place? This happens in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers except possibly the last one. Let's see: From 0-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is included). So total tens place 8's: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me confirm. Each hundred has a range where the tens digit is 8, except the last one. So 4 full hundreds (0-399) each contribute 10, and then 480-488 contributes 9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** How many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? This would be in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So total 4's:188, total 8's:98. Now, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 4's. I had 50, but let me recount. For 4's in the tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Yes, that's correct. And for 8's in the tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So 4*10 +9=49. That's correct too. So the difference is indeed 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades (480 numbers) contributing 48 instances, plus one more in 484, totaling 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges (including 440-449), each contributing 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades contributing 48 instances, plus one more in 488, totaling 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full ranges contributing 40 instances, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.

From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers. Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10 numbers. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. Now, adding up the counts for each place: Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. Total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. Using the same method as before: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, here the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, for 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, the counts are: 0-99: 10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, but earlier in the 4's, the hundreds place went up to 488, but for 8's, in the tens place, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up the counts for each place: Units: 49, Tens: 49, Hundreds: 0. Total 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: Units: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total 188. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total 98. Difference: 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but let me check again, especially the tens place for 8's. From 0-99: 80-89 \u219210. 100-199:180-189\u219210. 200-299:280-289\u219210. 300-399:380-389\u219210. 400-488:480-488\u21929. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, total 8's:49+49=98. And 4's:49+50+89=188. So, difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.

Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, then 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, the count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Let's see: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189: 10 numbers - 280-289: 10 numbers - 380-389: 10 numbers - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 ranges with 10 numbers each and 1 range with 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=49+49=98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For the 4's: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For the 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm wondering if I missed something in the hundreds place for 8's. Since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can't be 8, so 0 is correct. Maybe I made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me recount the tens place for 8's. The ranges are: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place for 8's. Let me check again. The units place for 8's goes from 8 to 488, stepping by 10 each time. So, 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The last term is 488, which is 8 + 10*(n-1)=488. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 terms. That's correct. Similarly, for 4's in the units place, it's 4,14,...,484. Let's check: 4 +10*(n-1)=484. 10*(n-1)=480, n-1=48, n=49. So, 49 terms. So, that's correct. So, the total 4's are 188, 8's are 98, difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers. The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This gives 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers. The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think. The numbers would be 4,14,24,...,484. That's from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, the blocks are 40-49 (1st block), 140-149 (2nd), 240-249 (3rd), 340-349 (4th), and 440-449 (5th). But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, I'm only concerned about the hundreds digit being 4. So, each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. Wait, but actually, when considering the hundreds place, each number from 400 to 488 has 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, how many blocks? Let's see: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 full blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as pages don't reach 800.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each ten numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, how many tens are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full tens and then 8 extra numbers. So, in each full ten, 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. Does 484 fall into this? Yes, so that's one more occurrence. So, total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but when I divide 488 by 10, I get 48 full tens and 8 numbers. So, in each full ten, 4 appears once in units place, so 48 times. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once more. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, but 540-549 would be beyond, so we don't count that. So, how many blocks? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 times. But wait, let me check: 40-49: 10 numbers, 4 in tens place. 140-149: 10. 240-249: 10. 340-349: 10. 440-449: 10. So, 5*10=50. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Wait, no. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, inclusive. So, that's 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, let me add up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. So, 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? Let's see. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? Each ten has one, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so that's one more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block. Let's count how many such blocks. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, each block contributes 10, except the last one, which contributes 9. So, number of 8's in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4*10=40 plus 9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recount the 4's: units place: 49, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when I counted the 4's in the hundreds place, I considered 400-488, which is 89 numbers. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488-400+1=89. That's correct. And in the tens place for 4's, I had 5 blocks: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. That's correct. For 8's in the tens place, I had 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 5 blocks, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, 4 blocks of 10 and 1 of 9, totaling 49. That seems correct. Units place for both 4 and 8: 49 each. So, 4's total: 188, 8's total:98. Difference:90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to miscount, especially in the hundreds place. Let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1=89. So, 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4. So, that's correct. And in the hundreds place, 8 never appears because the book ends at 488, so 800 isn't reached. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. So, 98 8's in total. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full tens and one partial ten (481-488), totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 never appears as the hundreds digit.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me think. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place (second digit):** The 4 can appear in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers each time. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one block, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, since 449 is less than 488. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, in each block, how many times does the digit 4 appear in the tens place? It's 10 times per block. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place (third digit):** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers contributes one 4. So, 89 times. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 only for numbers 400-499, but since the book ends at 488, it's 400-488. So, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, does 488 count as an extra? Because 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 488 is the 49th number ending with 8. So, actually, it's 49 times. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate. The number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus one if the last number in the range ends with 8. So, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? It's the integer division of 488 by 10, which is 48, plus 1 if the remainder is >=8. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, yes, we add 1. So, total is 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers each time. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 fall within the book? The book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, how many blocks are there? From 0-99: 80-89, that's one block, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another block, 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289, another block, 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389, another block, 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9. So, total in the tens place is 4\u00d710 +9=49. Wait, but in each block except the last, it's 10 numbers, so 4 blocks \u00d710=40, plus 9 in the last partial block, total 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (every 10 numbers, e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (numbers 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (every 10 numbers, e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences (no page numbers in 800-899).\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Let me think. Starting from 4, each 10 numbers add one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, how many 4's in the units place? 480 divided by 10 is 48, so that's 48 times. Then, 484 is the next one, which is the 49th occurrence. So, the units place has 49 4's. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within range, and 494 would be beyond 488, so actually, the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 for 4 itself, so 49 times. Okay, so units place: 49 4's. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, and so on. Now, how many such blocks are there? The hundreds digit can be 0 (for 40-49), 1 (140-149), 2 (240-249), 3 (340-349), and 4 (440-449). But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, the tens place has 50 4's. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Let's see how many numbers that is. 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, yes, 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers are there? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 - 8 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 for the starting number, so 49 times. So, units place: 49 8's. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count these blocks. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-489 would be the next block, but since the book only goes up to 488, we don't have all 10 numbers in this block. So, how many 8's in the tens place? Let's calculate each block: 80-89: 10 8's. 180-189: 10 8's. 280-289: 10 8's. 380-389: 10 8's. 480-488: Here, the tens digit is 8, so numbers 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, 9 8's in the tens place from 480-488. So, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 8's, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Then, 480-488 contributes 9 more, so total 40 + 9 = 49. Yes, that's correct. So, tens place: 49 8's. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 8's. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Total blocks: 5 (including 440-449 within 488).\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 89.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Total blocks: 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 40 occurrences.\n   - Partial block 480-488 contributes 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count these: - 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place. - 140-149: Another 10, so total 20. - 240-249: Another 10, total 30. - 340-349: Another 10, total 40. - 440-449: Another 10, but wait, the book only goes up to 488. So, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 more, making it 50. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so yes, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check again. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Hmm, that seems high. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me think again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count: - 80-89: 10 numbers, 10 8's. - 180-189: 10, total 20. - 280-289: 10, total 30. - 380-389: 10, total 40. - 480-488: That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 8's in the tens place here. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, is that correct? Let me think: 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. Let me double-check that. From 400 to 488, how many numbers? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct. And in the tens place, I had 50 4's, and units place 49. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's, units and tens each have 49, so 98 total. So, 188 - 98 = 90.

So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So that's five ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 x 10 = 50.

How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's.

Since the book only goes up to 488, the range 480-489 isn't fully there. So, let's check. From 0-99: 80-89 is one range, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, how many 8's in the tens place here? Let me count. 80-89: 10. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, total in tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.

    "text": " Let me think. The numbers go from 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The difference between each is 10, so the count would be ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, let's see how many such blocks exist up to 488. The blocks are 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in each of these numbers, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but actually, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers. So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. The count is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block. So, each block contributes 10 numbers, except the last one which might be less. Let's count them. - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189: 10 - 280-289: 10 - 380-389: 10 - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (80s, 180s, 280s, 380s) which is 4*10=40, plus the last block which has 9 numbers. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems right. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit '4':**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit '4' appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nTotal '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit '8':**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The digit '8' appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit '8' appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, except the last block which contributes 9 (480-488).\n   - Total: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit '8' does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Occurrences: 0.\n\nTotal '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\nThus, there are 90 more '4's than '8's in the page numbers.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me check: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10 each time. So, starting at 4, the sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms in this sequence is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges exist up to 488. The first is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. Since 488 is the last page, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. Let's count how many. The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last range. Let me calculate each: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189: 10 numbers - 280-289: 10 numbers - 380-389: 10 numbers - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page) So, total 8's in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, yes, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, giving 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last range being 480-488 (9 numbers). Totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think. The first 4 in the units place is at 4, which is the 4th number. Then every 10 numbers after that. So, from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449? Yes, because 488 is the last page, so 449 is within 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. Each number here has a hundreds digit of 4. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's do the same for 8. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many times? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count the ranges: From 0-99: 80-89 is one range. From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: 480-489, but wait, 489 is beyond 488, so it's only up to 488. So, 480-488: how many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, the range from 480-488 has 9 numbers, not 10. So, that's 4 full ranges (each 10 numbers) and one partial range with 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. Correct. 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Let me check: from 4 to 484, how many numbers are there? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? The first block is 1-100, then 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 401-488. So, the full blocks are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. Let's see how many complete blocks there are. From 1-400, there are four blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 occurrences, so 4 blocks * 10 = 40. Now, the last block is 401-488. How many numbers are there here? 488 - 400 = 88, so 401-488 is 88 numbers. The tens place in this block is 4 for numbers 401-410, 411-420, ..., but wait, actually, the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, then 1 for 410-419, etc. Wait, no, that's not right. The tens digit in 401-488 is determined by the tens place. Let me think again. The tens digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490), but since we only go up to 488, the last group is 481-488. So, the tens digit is 4 in the range 440-449. How many numbers is that? From 440-449, that's 10 numbers. So, in the 401-488 block, there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last group is 480-488. Each full block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences in the tens place. So, from 1-400, how many blocks? 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Now, the 401-488 block: the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers? From 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference. \n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4, 14, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let me check: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The difference between each is 10, so the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Let's count how many sets of 10 there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many such sets are there? From 0-99: 1 set, 100-199: 1 set, 200-299: 1 set, 300-399: 1 set, 400-488: 1 set. Wait, but 400-488: 440-449 is within that, so that's another set. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 occurrences. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. So, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because the hundreds digit is only 4 for numbers 400-499, but since our book ends at 488, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 occurrences of the digit 4. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many terms? ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is within 488. 480-489 is up to 489, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, how many sets? From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189 is another 10. 200-299: 280-289 is another 10. 300-399: 380-389 is another 10. 400-488: 480-488 is part of the tens place. Wait, 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no: 480 is the first, 481, 482, ..., 488. So, that's 9 numbers, but wait, 480 is included, so 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the number of sets is 4 full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, and one partial set contributing 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 occurrences of the digit 8. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=49+50=99+89=188. For the 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98.

    "text": " Let me think. From 4 to 484, each 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place. So, starting at 4, every 10th number adds a 4 in the units place. So, the count should be (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Hmm, maybe I was wrong earlier. So, it's 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid. Let me count how many sets of ten there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one set, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, from 100-199: 140-149 is another set, 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249, 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349, 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many such numbers? (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see: From 0-99: 80-89 is one set, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289, 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389, 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), right? Because 480 is included, and 488 is the last page. So, how many sets? The first four sets (80-89, etc.) each have 10 numbers, so 4*10 = 40. Then, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct. Now for 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. Number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. First four sets: 4*10=40. Last set: 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. Is there any other place where 8's might appear? Like in the hundreds place? No, because the book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit can only be 1,2,3,4. So, no 8's in the hundreds place. So, my count seems correct. Therefore, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let me think. The first 4 is at 4, which is the 1st occurrence, then 14 is the 2nd, and so on. So, from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, the last block is 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 up to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's count the blocks. From 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98 times. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " Let me think. Starting from 4, every 10 numbers adds another 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The formula is (488 + 1) divided by 10, then take the floor of that. So, (488 + 1) is 489, divided by 10 is 48.9, so floor is 48. But wait, 488 is the last page. So, does 488 have an 8 in the units place, not a 4. So, the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's one set, then 140-149: second set, 240-249: third, 340-349: fourth, and 440-449: fifth. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's five sets, each contributing 10 occurrences. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is indeed less than 488, so yes, all five sets are valid. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. So, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's calculate how many times. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the units place. So, (488 + 1) / 10 = 48.9, floor is 48. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can only have 8 if the number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. Now, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 187 - 97 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For the 8's: units 48, tens 49. 48+49=97. 187-97=90. Hmm, seems correct. But wait, let me check the tens place for 8 again. I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 ranges. The first four are 10 each, the last is 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That's correct. And for the 4's in the tens place, I had 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five ranges, each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. The hundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So, the difference is indeed 187-97=90.

    "text": " Let me think. From 4 to 484, each 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place. So, 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4, so that's 49 times. Hmm, maybe I should calculate it as (488 // 10) + 1 if the last number is 484, but actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer division would give 48. But since 484 is less than 488, maybe it's 48 times. Wait, let's check: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 4 + 10(n-1) = 484. Solving for n: 10(n-1) = 480 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, for the tens place, 4 can appear as 40-49 in each hundred. So, in 1-100, 40-49 is 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. Similarly, in 101-200, 140-149, another 10. This pattern continues up to 400-488. Wait, 400-488 is part of the 400s, so 400-488 includes 400-488, which is 89 numbers. But for the tens place, in each hundred, it's 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, from 1-400, how many hundreds are there? 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8 in the 400s. Wait, but 401-488: the tens digit is 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490), but 488 is the last page, so 481-488 is 8 numbers. Wait, but in the 400s, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. But when considering the tens place, the 4 in the tens place only occurs in 440-449, right? Wait no, in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488. 10(n-1) = 480 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Let's see how many such sets there are up to 488. From 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489. But 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the 400s, the tens digit is 8 in 9 numbers. Therefore, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the 800s, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check the counts. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, in the tens place for 4's, I considered 40-49 in each hundred, which is 10 per hundred, and 4 hundreds, so 40, plus 10 in 401-488, making 50. That seems right. For 8's, in the tens place, 40 in 1-400, and 9 in 401-488, totaling 49. Units place for both is 49 each. So, yes, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let me check: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The sequence starts at 4 and ends at 484, with each step being 10. So the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are up to 488. From 1-100: 40-49 (10 numbers) From 101-200: 140-149 (10 numbers) From 201-300: 240-249 (10 numbers) From 301-400: 340-349 (10 numbers) From 401-488: 440-449 (10 numbers) Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so the last block is only up to 488. But 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10 numbers. So, each hundred has 10, and there are 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. Wait, but 401-488 is 88 numbers, which is less than a hundred. But the tens place 4's in 401-488 would be in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 10 * 5 = 50? Wait, no, because from 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. Hmm, but wait, 401-488 is only 88 numbers, but 440-449 is within that range, so yes, 10 numbers. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each number here has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the 8's, checking units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The first is 8, the last is 488. Let's find how many terms. (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each block of 100 has 10 occurrences in the tens place. Let's see: From 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers) From 101-200: 180-189 (10 numbers) From 201-300: 280-289 (10 numbers) From 301-400: 380-389 (10 numbers) From 401-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, 480-488 has 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks with 10 each, and one block with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Because 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4, so maybe it's 49 times? Let me think: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 480, there are 480 / 10 = 48 times. Then from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, making it 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This occurs in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then each hundred has another 10, so 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many sets of 10 are there? Let's see: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This occurs in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This occurs in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's check each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total tens places with 8: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10, because 489 isn't included. So, that's correct. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This would occur in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Because 484 is the 48th number where 4 is in the units place. Let me think. From 4 to 484, each 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place. So, 484 is the 48th such number. So, that's 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where 4 is in the tens place. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49, that's one block. From 100-199: 140-149, another block. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 300-399: 340-349, and 400-488: 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is only up to 449, but the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is a complete block. So that's five blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times. But wait, let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 is 10, 340-349 is 10, and 440-449 is 10. That's 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in each of these numbers, the hundreds digit is 4. So, that's 89 times where 4 is in the hundreds place. Wait, but is that correct? Let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the number of 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, does 488 count? Let me see. 488 is the last page. So, the last 8 in the units place would be 488. So, how many such numbers are there? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. To find how many terms there are, I can take (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 80-89, that's one block (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189, another block (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289, another block (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389, another block (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, total blocks: four complete blocks (each with 10 numbers) and one incomplete block with 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where 8 is in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.

    "text": " Let me think. If I take 488 divided by 10, that's 48.8, so the number of 4's in the units place would be 48. But actually, when I count from 4 to 484, stepping by 10, the number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one block, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another block, another 10. Similarly, 240-249 (200-299), 340-349 (300-399), and 440-449 (400-488). Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10 numbers. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, the last block is 440-449, which is within 400-488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But we're only concerned with the hundreds digit being 4, so that's 89 times. Wait, no. Actually, each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block, but since the book ends at 488, we only go up to 488. So, let's count these blocks. From 0-99: 80-89 is one block, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Now, how many numbers is that? 480-488 is 9 numbers, since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place (400-488) occurs 9 times, not 10. So, for the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial block of 9 (480-488). So, that's 4 * 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484.

    "text": " Let me check: from 4 to 484, that's 484 - 4 = 480, and 480 / 10 = 48. So that's 49 numbers (including both 4 and 484). Hmm, maybe I should think of it as how many times 4 appears in the units place. Since every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so in each set of 10, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, in the 480th number, which is 480, the units digit is 0, so the next number, 481, has units digit 1, and so on up to 488. So the last complete set is 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the units digit 4 in 484 is included. So actually, it's 49 times? Wait, no. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of times 4 is in the units digit. So for each ten's place, 4 appears once in the units. So from 1 to 488, how many tens? 48 full tens (since 488 / 10 = 48.8). So 48 times, but wait, 488 is the last number, so the units digit goes up to 8. So in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So total units place 4's: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So how many such ranges are there? Let's see: from 0-99, 40-49 is one range. From 100-199, 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Now, since the book goes up to 488, 440-449 is within the range, but 540-549 would be beyond 488, so we don't count that. So how many ranges? Each hundred has one range where the tens digit is 4. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times 4 appears in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's valid. So 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. Each number here has 4 in the hundreds place. So how many numbers? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Wait, let me check that again. Units: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last number, so the units digit 8 in 488 is included. So in the last set (481-488), 488 is included, so the units digit 8 appears once more. So total units place 8's: 48 +1=49. Wait, no, because from 1 to 488, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete sets of 10 plus any remaining. So 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So each complete set contributes one 8, so 48 times, and in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once (at 488). So total units place 8's: 48 +1=49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 can appear in the tens place. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see how many such ranges exist up to 488. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: does 480-489 exist? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488), but the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, but since 488 is the last page, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, but wait, 480 is 480, which is 4 in hundreds, 8 in tens, 0 in units. So from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, but how many? 488 -480 +1=9 numbers. So in the hundreds place 4, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times. So total tens place 8's: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, etc.) plus 9 in 480-488. So 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but wait, from 0-99, 80-89 is 10 numbers. Similarly, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 are each 10 numbers. Then in 400-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98. Wait, but let me double-check. Units:49, tens:49, so 98 total 8's. Now, the number of 4's was 187, and 8's are 98. So the difference is 187 -98=89. So there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each part again.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 in units. So 48 times. But wait, 484 is included, which is the 48th set? Wait, no, 484 is 48*10 +4=484, so that's the 49th occurrence? Wait, no, because the first occurrence is 4, which is the first set (1-10). Then 14 is the second set (11-20), and so on. So 484 is in the 48th set (481-490), but since we only go up to 488, the units digit 4 in 484 is included. So total units place 4's: 48 (from 1-480) plus one more in 484, making it 49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, I'm confused now. Let me think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of times the units digit is 4 from 1 to 488. So that's floor(488/10)=48 times, because every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. But since 488 is the last number, and 488 mod 10 is 8, which is greater than 4, so the last 4 in units place is at 484, which is 48*10 +4=484. So total units place 4's:48. So I think my initial count was correct at 48. Then tens place:50, hundreds place:89, total 187.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place:49, as 488 is included.\n- Tens place:49, as calculated.\n- Hundreds place:0.\n\nSo total 8's:98.\n\nDifference:187-98=89.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Total occurrences: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, taking the integer part).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10 occurrences.\n   - There are 5 such ranges (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), but only the first four full ranges and the partial range up to 449.\n   - Total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences (488 - 400 + 1).\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, plus the extra 8 at 488).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contributing 10 occurrences.\n   - There are 4 full ranges (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), and an additional 9 occurrences in 480-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Let me check. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each complete set of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the number of 4's in the units place would be the number of complete decades (sets of 10) in 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete decades, meaning 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 have a 4 in the units place? No, it's 8. So, the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? Well, in the hundreds place, we can have 0,1,2,3,4. But since we're dealing with page numbers starting from 1, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for pages 1-99), 1, 2, 3, or 4. But wait, for the tens place, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4, but the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges? Let's see:\n\n- Pages 40-49: 10 numbers\n- Pages 140-149: 10 numbers\n- Pages 240-249: 10 numbers\n- Pages 340-349: 10 numbers\n- Pages 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nBut wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in pages 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. So, total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, meaning 48 occurrences. But wait, 488 is included, so does that add one more? Let's see: 8,18,...,488. The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. Wait, 8 is the 1st, 18 the 2nd, ..., 488 is the 49th. Because 488 = 8 + (49-1)*10 = 8 + 480 = 488. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8's in the tens place appear in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8's in the hundreds place would be pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0. Total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, total 4's: 187, total 8's: 98. Difference: 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's:\n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the units place for 4's, I thought it was 48, but for 8's it was 49. Let me check that again. For units place of 4's: from 4,14,...,484. How many? 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 = 4 + (48-1)*10 = 4 + 470 = 474. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, units place for 4's is 49 times. Wait, so I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, earlier I thought units place for 4's was 48, but actually, it's 49 because 484 is the 49th occurrence. Because 4 is the first, 14 the second, ..., 484 is the 49th. So, units place for 4's: 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place, it's also 49, as 488 is the 49th.\n\nSo, let me recalculate:\n\n4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so I initially thought units for 4's was 48, but it's actually 49. So, the total 4's are 188, 8's are 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm the units place for 4's. The first 4 is at 4, which is the 1st, then 14 is the 2nd, ..., up to 484, which would be the 49th. So yes, 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: 8,18,...,488. The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 = 8 + 48*10 = 8 + 480 = 488. So, 49 times.\n\nSo, 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 187, but that was a mistake because I miscounted the units place. So, the correct difference is 90.\n\nBut let me double-check the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nTens place for 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98.\n\nDifference: 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first calculated, I thought 4's units place was 48, but it's actually 49. So, the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a more systematic approach.\n\nFor any digit position, the number of times a digit d appears can be calculated by considering higher digits, current digit, and lower digits.\n\nBut perhaps that's more complicated. Alternatively, I can think of it as:\n\nFor each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n1. Units place:\n\n- The number of complete cycles of 10 in 488 is 48 (since 48*10=480). Each cycle has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is beyond 480, so from 481 to 488, there's another 4 in 484. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, so 49 times in units place.\n\n2. Tens place:\n\n- The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). There are 4 hundreds in 488 (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, actually, 488 is the upper limit, so the hundreds are 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nIn each of the first four hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers each. So, 4*10=40.\n\nIn the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 440-449. So, 10.\n\nSo, total tens place for 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n\n- The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. That's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\n1. Units place:\n\n- Number of complete cycles of 10 in 488 is 48, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48. But 488 is included, which is another 8 in the units place, making it 49.\n\n2. Tens place:\n\n- The tens digit is 8 for ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n\nEach of the first four ranges (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40.\n\nThe last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n\n- The hundreds digit is 8 for pages 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. Then, in the 49th group (481-490), the 484 is within this group, so that's another 4. So, total 4's in units place would be 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me check again. From 1 to 480, there are 480 numbers. 480 divided by 10 is 48, so 48 4's in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the 484 is the next 4 in the units place. So total 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, so 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. Starting from 40-49: that's one range. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five ranges in total. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within the page numbers? Since the book goes up to 488, yes, 440-449 is within 1-488. So, 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last range. Let's count the ranges. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is from 800 to 899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, contributing 10 each, totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in numbers 400-488, contributing 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think. The numbers would be 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. So from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many numbers that is. Each set of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is 10. From 200-299: 240-249 is 10. From 300-399: 340-349 is 10. From 400-488: 440-449 is 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, right? So that's 5 sets of 10 numbers each, so 5*10=50 times. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, we're only considering the hundreds digit. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Wait, but let me check. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last occurrence is 488. So, how many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each set. From 1-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total for tens place: 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I thought maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. So, 488-400+1=89 numbers. Yes, that's correct. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. For 8's, the hundreds place doesn't contribute anything, so 0. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 5 sets (including 440-449).\n   - Number of occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each set of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences for the first four sets, and 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Number of occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
