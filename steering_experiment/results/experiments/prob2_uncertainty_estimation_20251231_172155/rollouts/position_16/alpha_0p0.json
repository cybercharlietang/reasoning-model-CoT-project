    "text": " Let me check: starting from 4, each subsequent 4 in the units place is 10 apart. So, 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 440-449. How many such sets are there? Each set has 10 numbers. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, and so on. Let's see how many full sets there are. The hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. But since we start from 1, the first set is 40-49 (hundreds digit 0). Then 140-149 (hundreds digit 1), 240-249 (hundreds digit 2), 340-349 (hundreds digit 3), and 440-449 (hundreds digit 4). That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so it's valid. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (488 - 400 +1 = 89). But how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Each number from 400-488 has 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. The hundreds place is only the first digit, so each number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, the count is 488 - 400 +1 = 89. Wait, but 400 is included, so yes, 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 +50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. So, 49 times in units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Each set has 10 numbers except the last one, which has 9 (since 488 is the last page). So, let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 +49 +0=98. So, 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484)\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449)\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488)\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488)\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488)\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me check: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The difference between each is 10, so the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Let me see how many sets of 100 there are in 488. Since 488 is less than 500, we have four sets: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, actually, 488 is the last page, so the 4 in the tens place can appear in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 40-49: yes, that's one. Then each subsequent hundred up to 440-449. So, that's 5 sets in total (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Each set contributes 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50 occurrences. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last occurrence is at 488. So, how many terms? Starting at 8, each step is 10. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. So, 8 + 10(n-1) \u2264 488 \u2192 10(n-1) \u2264 480 \u2192 n-1 \u2264 48 \u2192 n \u2264 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. How many such sets are there? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which only goes up to 488, so that's 9 numbers. So, first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 numbers, contributing 4 x 10 = 40. The last set, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens place occurrences: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899. But the book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me check. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. The number of complete groups of 10 in 488 is 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8). Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit goes up to 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, units place gives 48 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. The first is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but 488 is included, right? So, from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, there are 187 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is the 49th. Wait, let me think. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (each 10 numbers) and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So, in each full group of 10, there's one 8 in the units place. So, 48 full groups give 48 eights. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 is included once. So, total units place eights: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights. But wait, does 380-389 go beyond 488? No, because 389 is less than 488. So, that's fine. So, tens place contributes 40 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (fours) - 89 (eights) = 98. So, there are 98 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Let me check: starting from 4, each 10 numbers adds one more 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 times for each digit. But since 488 ends with 8, the units digit 4 appears 48 times? Wait, that doesn't sound right because 488 is the last page. Let me think again. For the units place, the number of 4's is equal to the number of complete decades (sets of 10 numbers) in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 complete decades. Each decade has exactly one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, in the 480th page, which is 480, the units digit is 0, so the 48th decade ends at 480, and then we have 481 to 488. In that last partial decade, 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so no 4 in the units place. Therefore, the number of 4's in the units place is 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges exist within 1 to 488. The first is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. Now, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then each subsequent hundred has another 10. So, 40-49 is in the 40s, then 140-149 in the 140s, 240-249 in the 240s, 340-349 in the 340s, and 440-449 in the 440s. That's 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, does the 440-449 range go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, the tens digit 4 appears 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers are there? The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so in the last decade (480-488), the units digit 8 appears once at 488. So, the total number of 8's in the units place is 48. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many such ranges there are. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-488: the tens digit is 8 here, but how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), but the tens digit is 8 in all of these. So, that's 9 numbers. Wait, but in the tens place, each range like 80-89 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, for 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 to 899. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, there are 97 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations, especially for the tens place in the 8's count. For the tens place, I had 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). That's 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. For the 4's in the tens place, I had 5 ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449, each contributing 10, so 5x10=50. That seems correct. Units place for 4's: 48, and for 8's:48. Hundreds place for 4's:89, and 0 for 8's. So, 48+50+89=187 for 4's, and 48+49+0=97 for 8's. 187-97=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (from 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (from 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times (including 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear, as pages go up to 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? Since the book goes up to 488, the last block is 440-449. Let's see: from 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). 100-199: 140-149 (10). 200-299: 240-249 (10). 300-399: 340-349 (10). 400-488: 440-449 (10). So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers.

How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last number is 488, so let's calculate how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, for the first four blocks (80-89, etc.), each contributes 10, so 4 x 10 = 40. The last block contributes 9. So total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place from 800-899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers in the hundreds place that have an 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up the number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. This is 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. This is 89 times.\n  \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. This is 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. Starting from 40-49 (that's the first range), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges in total. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 occurrences. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll check each place again: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same method as before: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers. Let's count the ranges. From 80-89: that's one range. Then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's a total of 4 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 4 * 10 = 40 occurrences. Wait, but 480-489 would be another range, but since the book only goes up to 488, the range 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, does that affect the count? Let me think. The tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have the four full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 40, plus the partial range 480-488 contributing 9. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but earlier I thought the ranges were 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So that's 5 ranges. But 480-488 is only 9 numbers. So, 4 full ranges (each 10) and one partial range (9). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 to 899. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's one range. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's a total of 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50 occurrences. But wait, does the last range, 440-449, go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so all 50 numbers are valid. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 here. Let's see how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours printed. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.

Then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 ranges in total. Each range has 10 numbers, so 4 x 10 = 40 occurrences. Wait, but 380-389 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 40 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, there are 89 eights printed. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (number of 4's) - 89 (number of 8's) = 99.

    "text": " Let me check: starting from 4, each subsequent 4 in the units place is every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10, so the number of 4's in the units place is the number of times 4 appears in the ones place. So, for each ten numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), there's exactly one 4 in the units place. How many such tens are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full tens and then a partial ten. But since we're looking for complete 4's in the units place, each full ten contributes one 4. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, which is 488. The units digit here is 8, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, let's see how many such ranges there are. The first is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10, and so on. How many such ranges are there in 488 pages? The hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. Wait, but page numbers start from 1, so the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the tens digit being 4 occurs in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these contributes 10 numbers, so that's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but wait, the last range is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 only in the pages 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So, that's 89 times. Wait, but wait, the hundreds digit is only 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48+50=98, plus 89=187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The last occurrence is 488, which is the 48th set of 10. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full tens, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, how many 8's in the tens place? For the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributes 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 more. So total 40+9=49. Wait, but wait, let me confirm. The range 480-488 is from 480 to 488 inclusive. So, 488-480+1=9 numbers. So, 9 times 8 appears in the tens place in that last range. So, total 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the highest page is 488, which is in the 400s. So, no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens: 48 + 49=97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 187, number of 8's is 97. So, 187-97=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through the 4's again: units place: 48, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. Now for the 8's: units place:48, tens place:49, hundreds place:0. 48+49=97. So, 187-97=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

Then, 484 is the next one, making it 49. Hmm, so maybe it's 49 times. Wait, let me think again. If I consider 488 pages, the units digit cycles every 10. So, for each ten numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit 4 occurs at 484, which is within 480-489. So, yes, 48 times in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 484 fall within 488? Yes, 484 is less than 488, so it's included. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place.

From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, total 4's: 187.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the units digit. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one more 8. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. But 488 is included, so that's 49 times? Wait, let me check: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be 480-489, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it.

    "text": " Let me think. Starting from 4, each 10 numbers adds another 4. So, from 4 to 484, that's 484 - 4 = 480, and 480 / 10 = 48. But we have to include both endpoints, so it's actually 48 + 1 = 49 times. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place up to N can be calculated by (N // 10) + 1 if the units digit is >= the target digit. Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488. For units place, each group of 10 contributes exactly one 4. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4, and then an extra 8 pages. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48. But wait, does the 48th group end at 480, and then 481-488 is the 49th group. So, in the units place, from 1 to 488, how many 4's? Let's see: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times. Okay, so units place has 49 4's. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's look at the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199:140-149 (10). From 200-299:240-249 (10). From 300-399:340-349 (10). From 400-488:440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, total ranges are 5, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll go through the same process: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1= 48 +1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be another range, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488. So, let's count each range: 80-89:10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488.

    "text": " Let me check: starting from 4, every 10th number adds another 4 in the units place. So from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 4 times every 100 numbers. So, for 1-100: 10 numbers with 4 in units (4,14,...,94). For 101-200: another 10 (104,114,...,194). Similarly, 201-300: 10, 301-400:10, and 401-488: how many? Let's see, from 401 to 488, the units digit cycles 4,5,6,...,8. So, 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers. So total units place 4's: 10 (1-100) + 10 (101-200) + 10 (201-300) + 10 (301-400) + 9 (401-488) = 49. Wait, but earlier I thought 484 is the last, which would be the 49th. So, units place 4's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 40-49: 10 numbers. 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, tens place 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, hundreds place 4's:89. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +50 +89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 4's. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's in units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, last is 488. So, how many terms? The sequence is 8,18,...,488. The difference between each term is 10, so it's an arithmetic sequence with a1=8, d=10, an=488. The formula for the nth term is a_n = a1 + (n-1)d. So, 488 =8 + (n-1)*10 => 488-8= (n-1)*10 => 480=10(n-1)=>n-1=48=>n=49. So, 49 numbers. So, units place 8's:49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. So, let's count each range. 80-89:10 numbers. 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total tens place 8's:10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's:0. Therefore, total number of 8's is 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. 188-98=90. That seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - This is an arithmetic sequence starting at 4 with a common difference of 10.  \n   - The last term is 484, so the number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - This is an arithmetic sequence starting at 8 with a common difference of 10.  \n   - The last term is 488, so the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which contributes 9 (480-488).  \n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 occurrences. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same method as before: 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488 \u2192 (n-1)*10 = 480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers. Let's count the ranges: 0-99: 80-89 \u219210 numbers. 100-199:180-189\u219210. 200-299:280-289\u219210. 300-399:380-389\u219210. 400-488: Does 480-489 fall within 488? 480-489 would be up to 489, but the book ends at 488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, so in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, the hundreds place for 400-488 only has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, how many ranges? Let's see: 0-99:1, 100-199:1, 200-299:1, 300-399:1, and 400-488: partial. So, the first four ranges give 4*10=40, and the last range gives 9. So, total in the tens place: 40 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.

Hmm, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last one where 4 is in the units place. So, 484 is the 49th occurrence because 484 = 4 + (48-1)*10. Wait, maybe I should think of it as from 4 to 484, how many numbers with 4 in the units place. The first is 4, and the last is 484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 480-489 would be beyond 488. So, let's count how many full sets of 100 there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. From 200-299: 240-249 is another 10. From 300-399: 340-349 is another 10. From 400-488: 440-449 is another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place starting from 400 to 488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 is the last page. So, how many 8's in the units place? The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, let's count each set: From 1-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is another 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is another 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is another 10. From 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, adding these up: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times here. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

    "text": " Let me check: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The sequence starts at 4 and increments by 10 each time. The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. Solving for n: (n-1)*10 = 480 => n-1 = 48 => n=49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 1-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, each hundred has 10 numbers, and there are 4 hundreds (1-400). But wait, 400-488 is actually 89 numbers, but the tens digit 4 in 400-488 only applies to 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 10*5=50? Wait, no. Wait, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. But wait, 400-488 is the fifth block, but only 440-449 is within 400-488, which is another 10 numbers. So total 40 +10=50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So yes, 50 total. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, total 89 4's in the hundreds place. So, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many. The first is 8, the last is 488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, (n-1)*10 = 480 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks? From 1-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, total in tens place: 10*4 +9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, the difference is number of 4's minus number of 8's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the range 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences (with 480-488 contributing 9 instead of 10).\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me check: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The difference between each is 10, so the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-499, there are 5 ranges (40-49, 140-149, etc.), but since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 ranges (since 40, 140, 240, 340, 440). So, 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences. But wait, let me confirm: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5\u00d710=50. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the units digit. So, starting from 8, each step is 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each range contributes 10 numbers. How many such ranges are there? From 0-488, the ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be the next, but since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, we have four ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges each have 10 numbers, and the last one has 9. So, total occurrences: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let me check: starting from 4, each 10 numbers adds one more 4 in the units place. So from 1 to 480, that's 480/10 = 48 times. Then, 484 is the next one, making it 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, 484 is within 488, so yes, it's included. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 appears in the tens place for every block of 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the hundreds digits go up to 4. So, the tens place 4 appears in each hundred block. Let's see: 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. Now, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 times, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 449 is within 488, so yes, all 10 are included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many times. The last occurrence is at 488, which is 488/10 = 48.8. So, taking the integer part, 48, but let's check if 488 is included. 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one more. So, 8, 18, ..., 488 is the 49th. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, it's included. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many blocks? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times. 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, we have 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total.

    "text": " Let me check: starting from 4, each 10 numbers adds one more 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does the units digit cycle through 0-9? The total number of complete decades is 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8). In each complete decade, the units digit is 4 exactly once. So, that's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so in the incomplete decade from 481 to 488, the units digit goes up to 8. So, 484 is within that, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, actually, there are 49 times when 4 appears in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 488 count as a units digit? No, because 488 is 4 in the hundreds, 8 in the tens, and 8 in the units. So, the units digit 4 occurs at 484, which is within the 480-488 range. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 49. Wait, let me confirm: from 1-488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then 14, 24, ..., 484. The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The difference between each term is 10, so the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, the last page is 488, so does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, all 5 ranges are within 1-488. Therefore, 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, last is 488. The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The difference is 10, so number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Wait, the last range is 480-488 because the book ends at 488. So, let's count each range: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: how many numbers? From 480 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4.

So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. But wait, let me confirm: from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place. The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is valid, but 489 is beyond. So, how many ranges? Let's see: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189: 10 numbers - 280-289: 10 numbers - 380-389: 10 numbers - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, the first four ranges have 10 each, and the last one has 9. So, total in tens place: 4 x 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place. The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set would be 440-449. Let me count how many such sets there are. Each set has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, there are 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 is correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, there are 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. Using the same method: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, total in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. So yes, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set would be 440-449. Let me calculate how many full sets of 100 there are. From 1-488, the hundreds digits go up to 4. So, in the tens place, 4 can appear in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, each contributing 10 occurrences. So that's 5 * 10 = 50 occurrences. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. Since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 occurrences of the digit 4. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that is. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me check each set: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 occurrences of the digit 8. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract 98 from 188: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many complete sets of 100 we have in 488 pages. The first set is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. How many such sets are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, in each hundred, there's one set of 10 where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers) but since we start at 1, it's 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 occurrences. So, 5*10 = 50 occurrences. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's do the same for 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but let's check if 488 is included. The nth term is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1) = 480 => n-1 = 48 => n = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 8 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences, except possibly the last one. Let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me confirm: from 0-99: 80-89 (10), 100-199: 180-189 (10), 200-299: 280-289 (10), 300-399: 380-389 (10), and 400-488: 480-488 (9). So yes, that's 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5*10=50 occurrences. But wait, let me double-check. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers, then in 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). So that's 5*10=50. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, there are 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, the sequence is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. Solving for n: 10*(n-1)=480 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-489 would be from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Let's break it down: - 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488)\n\nSo, that's 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So total is 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term 4 and common difference 10.\n   - The nth term is given by \\(4 + 10(n-1) = 484\\).\n   - Solving for \\(n\\): \\(10(n-1) = 480 \\Rightarrow n-1 = 48 \\Rightarrow n = 49\\).\n   - **Total in units place:** 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers.\n   - There are 5 such ranges.\n   - **Total in tens place:** \\(5 \\times 10 = 50\\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - This range has \\(488 - 400 + 1 = 89\\) numbers.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** \\(49 + 50 + 89 = 188\\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term 8 and common difference 10.\n   - The nth term is given by \\(8 + 10(n-1) = 488\\).\n   - Solving for \\(n\\): \\(10(n-1) = 480 \\Rightarrow n-1 = 48 \\Rightarrow n = 49\\).\n   - **Total in units place:** 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges each contribute 10 numbers.\n   - The last range (480-488) contributes 9 numbers.\n   - **Total in tens place:** \\(4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49\\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** \\(49 + 49 + 0 = 98\\).\n\n**Difference between the number of 4's and 8's:**\n\\(188 - 98 = 90\\).\n\n**Final Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me check: from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, the digit 4 appears 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's see how many such groups there are. Each group has 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. How many such groups are there? From 40-49, that's 1 group. Then 140-149 is another, 240-249 another, 340-349 another, and 440-449 another. So that's 5 groups. Each group contributes 10 times, so 5 * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but does the last group go up to 449? Since the book has 488 pages, 449 is within the range, so yes, that's valid. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, let me add up the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. Using the same method: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count how many such groups. 80-89 is one group, 180-189 another, 280-289 another, 380-389 another. That's 4 groups. Each group contributes 10 occurrences, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. Wait, but does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? The book goes up to 488, so 480-488 would have 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers, but since we're only considering the tens place, the 8 in the tens place is from 480-489, but since the book stops at 488, the 8 in the tens place occurs 9 times (480-488). Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. When counting the tens place, I should consider each group of 100. So, from 0-99, the 80-89 is one group, 100-199: 180-189, 200-299: 280-289, 300-399: 380-389, and 400-488: 480-488. So, that's 5 groups. But wait, the 480-488 group is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, how does this affect the count? Let me think. Each group from 80-89, 180-189, etc., has 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences each. But the last group, 480-488, has only 9 numbers (since 488 is the end). So, for the tens place, the first four groups (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 times, and the last group (480-488) contributes 9 times. So, total in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but earlier I thought 4 groups, but actually, it's 5 groups because 480-488 is another group. So, 5 groups, but the last group only has 9 numbers. So, total is 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place because earlier I thought there might be 49 times, but let me recount. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 10 times. 180-189: 10 times. 280-289: 10 times. 380-389: 10 times. 480-488: 9 times. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49 times. Yes, that's correct. So, total 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, totaling 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the Digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units Place (1-488):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens Place (1-488):**\n   - 4 appears in groups like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - There are 5 such groups, each contributing 10 occurrences.\n   - Total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place (1-488):**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total occurrences: 89 times.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188 times.**\n\n**Counting the Digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units Place (1-488):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens Place (1-488):**\n   - 8 appears in groups like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - There are 4 full groups (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 40 times, and the last group (480-488) contributes 9 times.\n   - Total occurrences: 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place (1-488):**\n   - 8 does not appear in any hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0 times.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98 times.**\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90.**\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me check: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the blocks are: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50. Hmm, but wait, let me check the last block. The next block after 440-449 would be 540-549, but that's beyond 488, so we don't count that. So, 5 blocks, 50 numbers. So, 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, we're only looking at the hundreds digit being 4. So, every number from 400 to 488 has 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 numbers. But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 only for numbers 400-499, but since our book ends at 488, it's 400-488. So, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count how many blocks: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. The last block is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many total? The first four blocks are 10 each, so 4*10=40. The last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems right. But let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. Correct. For the tens place of 4's, I had 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. For the units place of 4's, up to 488, so 4,14,...,484. That's (484-4)/10 +1=48.4, which is 49 numbers. Correct. For the 8's, units place up to 488: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=48.8, which is 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place for 8's: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place for 8's: none, since the book ends at 488. So, 0. Therefore, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let me check: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The difference between each is 10, so the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are up to 488. The first range is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place is a bit different. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? Let's subtract 399 from 488: 488 - 399 = 89, but since both ends are inclusive, it's 89 + 1 = 90 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 90 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (90) = 49 + 50 + 90 = 189. So, there are 189 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the last range. Each full range (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, so let's see how many full ranges there are. The first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 8's, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, in the tens place, we have 40 + 9 = 49 8's. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me check again. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, and 380-389 another 10. So that's 4 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 40 8's. Then, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but how many numbers are there? 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would only appear in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, the total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 189 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 91. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's and 8's. Starting with 4's: units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place:90. Total: 49+50=99, +90=189. That seems correct. For 8's: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. Total:98. So, 189-98=91. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have overcounted the tens place for 4's. Let me check the tens place again. The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 ranges, 5*10=50. That's correct. Now, the hundreds place: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Wait, earlier I thought it was 90. Let me confirm: 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, actually, the hundreds place has 89 4's, not 90. So, I made a mistake there. So, correcting that: hundreds place for 4's:89. So, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=49+50=99, +89=188. So, 188 4's. Now, for 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the correct difference is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 5 ranges.\n   - Number of 4's: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and partially in 480-488.\n   - Full ranges: 4 ranges * 10 = 40.\n   - Partial range (480-488): 9 numbers.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me check: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. Each step is 10, so the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1. That would be (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many ranges that is. From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). Now, from 400-488, does 480-489 fall within? 480-489 would be within 400-488, but 488 is the last page. So, 480-488 is part of this. Let me check: 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers (from 480 to 488 inclusive). Wait, but in the tens place, 80-89, 180-189, etc., each have 10 numbers. So, from 0-399, we have 4 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, in the tens place, 40 + 9 = 49 occurrences. Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because in the tens place, each range like 80-89 is 10 numbers, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 489 is beyond 488. So, the tens place in 480-488 contributes 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. That seems right.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as pages go up to 488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set would be 440-449. Let's see how many full sets there are. Each set is 100 numbers, and in each set, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 1-488, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? Let's break it down: - 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 4's. - 140-149: another 10. - 240-249: another 10. - 340-349: another 10. - 440-449: another 10. Now, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. Let's calculate how many terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many full sets and partial sets there are. Each full set is 100 numbers, contributing 10 8's in the tens place. So, from 1-488: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: here, the tens digit is 8, but the units go from 0-8, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, in the tens place, we have 4 full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 8's, and one partial set (480-488) contributing 9 8's. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Finally, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 4's in units place: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the tens place in sets like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 4's, and there are 5 such sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's in units place: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in the tens place in sets like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each full set (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 8's, and the last set (480-488) contributes 9 8's.\n   - Total 8's in tens place: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8, as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference between the number of 4's and 8's:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Wait, no, because 4 is the first one, then every 10 after that. So, from 4 to 484, how many steps of 10 are there? Let me calculate it as (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: the first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? So that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 4's. Wait, but let me check: 40-49: 10 numbers, 4 in tens place. 140-149: same. 240-249: same. 340-349: same. 440-449: same. So yes, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, 401, ..., up to 488. So, yes, 89 numbers. So, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for 8's. I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. How many such numbers? Let's calculate. The first is 8, then every 10 after that. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Let me count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So, 10\u00d74 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. So, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.

So, 440-449 is fully included because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that?

The first is 8, the last is 488. The difference between 8 and 488 is 480, so 480/10 + 1 = 49 numbers. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's count the blocks: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488. The first four blocks are complete, each with 10 numbers. The last block, 480-488, has 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4 * 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no occurrences of 8 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's.

    "text": " Let me check: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms can be calculated as (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences. Let's see how many complete blocks there are. From 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449? Yes, because 488 is the last page, and 449 is less than 488. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll follow the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, let's calculate each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers\n\nSo, total in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total number of 4's:**\n\\[ 49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 50 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 89 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 188 \\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each complete range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 4 complete ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389).\n   - The last range, 480-488, contributes 9 numbers.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**\n\\[ 49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 49 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 0 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 98 \\]\n\n**Difference between the number of 4's and 8's:**\n\\[ 188 - 98 = 90 \\]\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me check: from 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. However, I need to check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so all 5 blocks are valid. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. Using the same formula as before: ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. How many blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89 is the first, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Wait, does 480-489 count? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the hundreds place, but the tens digit here is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Hmm, so in the tens place, for 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but it's only 9 numbers. So, I need to adjust. So, normally, without considering the last partial block, we have 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each with 10 numbers, totaling 40. But then, from 480-488, which is 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences here. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. There are 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488.

    "text": " Let me check: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. Each step is 10, so the number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 10. 300-399: 340-349, 10. 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers (440 to 449). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 400-488. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. Now, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8.

Let me check each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed are 98.

Let me count how many sets of ten there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, each hundred has another set. Since the book goes up to 488, the 440-449 range is within 488, so that's another 10. So, how many hundreds are there? Let's see: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, that's five sets. But wait, the 40-49 is in the first set (1-99), and the 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 are in the subsequent sets. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. Wait, but in the last set, 440-449, that's only 10 numbers, but 488 is beyond 449, so does that affect the count? No, because 440-449 is entirely within 488, so it's fine. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but let me double-check. The first set is 40-49: 10 numbers. Then, 140-149: another 10. Then 240-249: another 10. Then 340-349: another 10. Then 440-449: another 10. That's 5 sets, so 5\u00d710=50. Okay, that seems correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. So, adding up the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. Again, we'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. Using the same method: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count how many sets. From 80-89: 10 numbers. Then, 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-489 would be another set, but since the book only goes up to 488, we have to consider how many numbers in 480-488 have an 8 in the tens place. Wait, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since the book ends at 488, the numbers 480-488 have 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, for the hundreds place, let's see: 1-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189 is 10. 200-299: 280-289 is 10. 300-399: 380-389 is 10. 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.

The hundreds digit is 4 only for numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, let me add up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for 8's. I'll go through each digit position again. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count these. Each block of 100 numbers (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 1-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the hundreds place, for 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, the number of 8's in the tens place is: 4 blocks of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 from 480-488. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. Wait, that can't be right because 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers, not 10. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4 x 10 = 40 (from the first four blocks) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800 and 899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's recount the 4's: Units place: 49, correct. Tens place: 50, correct. Hundreds place: 89, correct. Total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For 8's: Units place: 49, correct. Tens place: 49, correct. Hundreds place: 0, correct. Total 8's: 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400 to 488, resulting in 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89 and 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear, as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me check: starting from 4, each 10 numbers add one more 4 in the units place. So, 484 is the 49th occurrence because 484 = 4 + 10*(48-1) = 4 + 470 = 474, but wait, 4 + 10*(n-1) should equal 484. Let me solve for n: 10*(n-1) = 480 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n=49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many sets of 100 there are. From 1-488, we have 4 complete sets of 100 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. In each 100, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, 4 sets would give 4*10=40. But wait, the last set is 400-499, but our book only goes up to 488. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, but wait, in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, 410-419, etc. Wait, no, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49 in each hundred. So, in 400-488, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? It's from 400-409, which is 10 numbers, and then 440-449, which is another 10, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488. So, actually, in the 400s, the tens digit 4 appears twice: once in 400-409 and once in 440-449. So, that's 20 numbers. Wait, but let me think again. For each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, in 1-100: 40-49 \u2192 10 times. In 101-200: 140-149 \u2192 10 times. In 201-300: 240-249 \u2192 10 times. In 301-400: 340-349 \u2192 10 times. Then, in 401-488: the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 4*10 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digit 4 appears in 400-409 and 440-449, which is 20 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, 440-449 is within that range, so that's 20. But earlier, in the hundreds place, we have 400-488, but the tens digit is 4 in 400-409 and 440-449, which is 20. So, adding up: 4 sets before 400, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus 20 in 400-488, totaling 60? Wait, that doesn't seem right because 400-488 is part of the 400s, so maybe I'm double-counting. Let me clarify: The total number of times the tens digit is 4 from 1-488 is as follows: For each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. There are 4 full hundred blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but actually, each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units place 49, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. Total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, starting from 8, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The nth term is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1) = 480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 occurrences of 8 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 1-100: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. From 101-200: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. From 201-300: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. From 301-400: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. Now, in 401-488: the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Adding up all the 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. Total 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, from 4, 14, ..., 484. This gives 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. This gives 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, giving 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, from 8, 18, ..., 488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book only goes up to 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in 1-99, we have 40-49 (10 numbers). In 100-199, 140-149 (10). In 200-299, 240-249 (10). In 300-399, 340-349 (10). In 400-488, 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, total number of 4's in the tens place is 5 ranges \u00d7 10 numbers = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Let's count the number of 8's in each place: 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. Number of terms: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, except maybe the last one. Let's check: From 1-99: 80-89 (10). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers (480-488). So, total in tens place: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, etc.) and 1 range of 9. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid, but 540-549 isn't. Let's count how many full blocks there are. Each block (like 40-49) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 40-49: 10 numbers. From 140-149: another 10. From 240-249: another 10. From 340-349: another 10. From 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. However, wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many such numbers? Let's see: 8,18,...,488. The first is 8, the last is 488. The formula is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1) = 480 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of this. Each block normally has 10 numbers, but the last one only goes up to 488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, let's check: 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, for the tens place: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289:10. - 380-389:10. - 480-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up the occurrences for 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set would be 440-449. Let's count how many sets there are.

So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, we're only interested in the hundreds digit being 4, which it is for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, which is 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 occurrences of the digit 4. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but the book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this set. Let's count the sets. The first set is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. The last set is incomplete because it goes up to 488 instead of 489. So, how many numbers are in 480-488? That's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, the first four sets are complete, each with 10 numbers, and the last set has 9 numbers. So, total occurrences in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no occurrences of 8 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 occurrences of the digit 8. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four sets contribute 40, and the last set contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences as page numbers don't reach 800.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me check: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. How many such ranges are there? Let's see: from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only up to 449, right? So, how many full hundreds have 40-49? From 0-99: 40-49 is one set, so 10 numbers. Then 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. 400-488: 440-449, another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall entirely within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 sets, 10 each, so 50. So, 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. The count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. Let's find how many terms there are. The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The difference between each term is 10, so the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check how many such ranges are within 1-488. From 0-99: 80-89 is one set, 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189, another 10. 200-299: 280-289, another 10. 300-399: 380-389, another 10. Now, 400-488: does 480-489 fall within 488? Yes, because 488 is the last page. So, 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. Wait, but the tens digit is 8 only when the tens place is 8, so 480-489 would have 10 numbers, but since we stop at 488, it's 9 numbers. But wait, let me think again. The tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since our book ends at 488, the last number with 8 in the tens place is 488. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the hundreds place 4, the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times. So, how many sets do we have? 0-99: 10 numbers. 100-199: 10. 200-299: 10. 300-399: 10. 400-488: 9. So total is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed: 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (4, 14, 24, ..., 484)\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449)\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488)\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (8, 18, 28, ..., 488)\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488)\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me check: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Hmm, so maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me correct that. So, in the units place, 4 appears 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, how many hundreds do we have? From 1-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 300-399: 340-349, and 400-488: 440-449. Wait, 400-488: the tens place is 4 only up to 449, right? So, from 400-449, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (440-449). But 450-488 would have tens digits 5-8, so no more 4's in the tens place after 449. So, how many blocks? Let's see: 1-99: 10 numbers, 100-199: 10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but 400-449 is only up to 449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks do we have? From 1-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189, another 10. 200-299: 280-289, another 10. 300-399: 380-389, another 10. 400-488: 480-489. Wait, but 480-489 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers: 480-489. So, that's 5 blocks again, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5*10=50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (0) = 99 times. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place again. Since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit only goes up to 4, so no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's are 49 + 50 = 99. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 99. So, the difference is 188 - 99 = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 50 = 99.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 99 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"
