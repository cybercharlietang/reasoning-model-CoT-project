    "text": " Yes, because 484 is the 49th number where the units digit is 4. So, in the units place, there are 49 occurrences of the digit 4. Wait, let me check that again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms can be calculated by (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's a total of 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 occurrences. However, I need to check if 440-449 is within 488. Since 449 is less than 488, yes, it's included. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. Wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. Let me see how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488, inclusive. The count is 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4 in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is 488, which is the 49th term because (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 occurrences. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is included, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of the range. So, how many ranges are there? From 0-99: 80-89 is one. From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. And from 400-488: 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, how does this affect the count? Let me think. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, total tens place occurrences: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9=49. Wait, but earlier I thought each range contributes 10, but the last one only contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8 in each place: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. When I considered the tens digit, I included 480-488 as 9 numbers. Is that correct? Yes, because 480 is the 48th page, and 488 is the last page. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (including both 480 and 488). So, 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers. So, 4*10=40 from the earlier ranges, plus 9, making 49. That seems correct. Similarly, for 4's in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, total 4's: 49+50+89=188. 8's: 49+49=98. So, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n- Total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8 to 488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last range being 480-488 (9 numbers), totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n- Total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, 484 is the 49th occurrence because 484 is 48*10 + 4. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but let me check: from 1 to 488, how many times does the units digit cycle through 0-9? Each complete set of 10 numbers contributes one 4 in the units place. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete tens plus any extra. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4. Then, in the incomplete set from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then, in the hundreds place, we have 100-999, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. How many blocks is that? Let's see: 40-49 (tens digit 4 in 10s), 140-149 (tens digit 4 in 100s), 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each contributes 10 occurrences, so 5*10=50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, let's add up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 occurrences of the digit 4. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's count how many. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, in the incomplete set, 488 is included, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is included, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of this. So, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 occurrences, and the last block contributes 9 occurrences because 488 is the last page. So, 4 blocks with 10 each: 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8, so numbers 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers (since 480 is the first and 488 is the last, so 488-480+1=9). So, yes, 49 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 occurrences of the digit 8. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place for 8, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 488-480+1=9. So, 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) giving 40, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49. That seems correct. Similarly, for 4's in the tens place, we had 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10, so 50. And hundreds place for 4 is 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 188 total 4's. For 8's, units place: 8,18,...,488. Since 488 is included, that's 49. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9), totaling 49. So, 98 total 8's. Therefore, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8 to 488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., plus 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, 484 is the 49th 4 in the units place. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to how many complete sets of 10 there are, plus any extra. The number of complete sets is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets). Each set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, because 484 is the 49th occurrence because we start counting from 4 as the first. So, 4,14,...,484: that's 484 - 4 divided by 10 plus 1. So (484 - 4)/10 = 480/10 = 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one set, so 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 fit within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. The last occurrence is 488. So, how many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is within the book. Since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of the range. So, each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences, except possibly the last one. Let's see: From 0-99: 80-89, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, 10. From 200-299: 280-289, 10. From 300-399: 380-389, 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, we have 4 full sets (80-89, etc.) each contributing 10, and then the last set contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 +9 = 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4,14,24,...,484.

    "text": " So, from 4 to 484, that's 48 intervals of 10, which gives 49 numbers. Wait, no, because when you count 4 as the first, then 14 is the second, and so on. So, 484 would be the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count how many sets of 100 there are. From 1-99, there's 40-49, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199, 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249 is 10, 340-349 is 10, and 440-449 is another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. But wait, the book ends at 488, so does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding them all up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count how many sets of 100 there are. From 1-99, 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199, 180-189 is 10. From 200-299, 280-289 is 10. From 300-399, 380-389 is 10. Now, from 400-488, does 480-489 fall within 488? Yes, 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, so from 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10 because 489 is beyond 488. So, for the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 (from 1-399) which is 40, plus 9 in 400-488, so 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, no. Wait, from 1-99, 10; 100-199, 10; 200-299, 10; 300-399, 10; and 400-488, 9. So that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's.

    "text": " Yes, because 484 is the 49th multiple. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 40-49: that's one block. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's a total of 5 blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.

So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens from page 400 to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But since 488 is included, it's actually 49 occurrences. Wait, let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. Let's count the blocks. From 80-89: that's one block. Then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. So that's 4 blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 eights, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 occurrences. But wait, the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is included, but 480-489 isn't fully included because the book ends at 488. So, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but how many numbers are there? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the tens digit is 8 for all these 9 numbers. Therefore, in the tens place, we have 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 more from 480-488. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, but in the tens place, 480-488 is actually 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8, but the hundreds digit is 4. So, in the tens place, we have 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 5 blocks, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check the tens place. When I was counting the eights in the tens place, I considered 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So that's five blocks, but the first four are full blocks of 10, and the last one is 9 numbers. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. So total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Wait, but earlier when I was counting the fours, I had 188 fours. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the eights in the tens place. Let me list them out: 80-89: 10 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: 9 numbers. So that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds: 0. So total eights: 98. Fours: 188. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place for fours. Let me check that again. Units place for fours: from 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The nth term is 10n - 6. Wait, no, the nth term can be expressed as 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 4 + 10(n-1) = 10n - 6. We want 10n -6 \u2264 488. So, 10n \u2264 494, so n \u2264 49.4. So, n=49. So, 49 terms. So, 49 fours in the units place. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d710=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so all 10 are included. So, 50 fours in the tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. Correct. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. Number of terms: (488-8)/10 +1=48 +1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, the last has 9. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none. So, total eights: 49+49=98. Therefore, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that in the tens place for eights, I counted 480-488 as 9 numbers, but actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place. So, total eights: 49+49=98. Fours:188. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks have 10 each, and the last has 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** None, as the book ends at 488.\n   \nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Yes, because 484 is the 49th number where the units digit is 4. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place up to 488 is equal to the number of complete groups of 10, plus any extra if the last number is beyond that. From 1 to 488, the number of complete groups of 10 is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups). Each group contributes one 4 in the units place. So that's 48 times. But wait, does 488 include another 4? 488 ends with an 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 49th occurrence because 484 is the 49th multiple of 10 minus 6? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me use a formula. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to n is floor(n/10). So for 488, floor(488/10) = 48. So 48 times. But wait, 488/10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. So 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such ranges are there up to 488? Let's see:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nSo that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So yes, 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similarly, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? Using the same formula, floor(488/10) = 48. But wait, 488 is included, so the last occurrence is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 minus 2? Wait, no. Let me think again. The number of times 8 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 ends with an 8, we have an extra occurrence. Wait, no, because floor(488/10) is 48, which counts up to 480, and then 488 is the 49th occurrence because 480 + 8 = 488. So actually, it's 49 times. Wait, but wait, the formula floor(n/10) gives the number of complete groups of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So for n=488, floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is equal to 8, we add 1 more. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences, except possibly the last one if it's cut short.\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nWait, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers, because 488-480+1=9.\n\nSo total tens place 8's: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, etc.) and one range of 9. So 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800 to 899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So 0 occurrences.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So yes, 49.\n\nNow, let's compute the difference: number of 4's (187) minus number of 8's (98) = 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's. Let me recount:\n\n4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 (from 4,14,...,484)\n- Tens place: 50 (from 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449)\n- Hundreds place: 89 (from 400-488)\n\nTotal: 48+50=98, +89=187. That seems correct.\n\n8's:\n\n- Units place: 49 (from 8,18,...,488)\n- Tens place: 49 (from 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488)\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal: 49+49=98.\n\nSo 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 4's again. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, 4 ranges of 10 and one of 9, totaling 49.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but wait a second, when I count the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. But in those numbers, the hundreds digit is 4, so each contributes one 4. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, there are no numbers with hundreds digit 8, so that's zero.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Total occurrences: \u230a488 / 10\u230b = 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 times.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187 times**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Since 488 ends with 8, total occurrences: \u230a488 / 10\u230b + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last range (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0 times.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98 times**.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **89**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Yes, because starting from 4 as the first, each subsequent 10 numbers adds another 4. So, 484 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, maybe I should think of it as (484 - 4)/10 + 1. Let me check: (484 - 4) is 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many such sets there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, I need to check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 sets of 10 numbers each, totaling 5*10=50 times. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is included. Since 440 is 440 and 449 is 449, both are less than 488, so yes, that's included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's see how many full sets we have. The ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, and the last range has 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, for the first four ranges, 4 sets * 10 = 40. The last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract 98 from 188: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let me check: 484 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 4 as the first, each subsequent 10 numbers add one more. So, 484 would be the 49th. Wait, maybe I should think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, does that include 484? Let me see: 484 is the 49th occurrence because 484 is the 49th multiple of 10 where the units digit is 4. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of times 4 is in that position. So, from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last number with 4 in the units place is 484, which is 484 = 4*100 + 8*10 + 4, so it's the 49th occurrence because 4,14,24,...,484 is 49 numbers. Wait, 484 is the 49th because 484 is 48*10 + 4, so yes, 49 times. So, units place: 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these decades contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such decades are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, each of these contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such decades. So, 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 decades, each contributing 10, so 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times.\n\nNow, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. Okay, that seems right.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, but let's see. The numbers where 8 is in the units place are 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last number with 8 in units place is 488. Let's count how many. Starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one more. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: 488 is the 49th because 488 = 48*10 + 8, so yes, 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 can appear in the tens place as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last one is 480-488. So, let's see:\n\n- 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers)\n- 100-199: 180-189 (10)\n- 200-299: 280-289 (10)\n- 300-399: 380-389 (10)\n- 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nWait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, for the hundreds place, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me double-check.\n\nUnits place: 8,18,28,...,488: that's 49 numbers.\n\nTens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me see if I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, when counting the hundreds place for 4's, I had 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nFor 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 49 total in tens place.\n\nUnits place for 8's is 49, so total 8's:98.\n\n4's:188, 8's:98, difference 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the units place for 4's. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in units place? The first is 4, then 14,24,...,484. How many terms? The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The nth term is 10n -6. Wait, let me see: 4 = 10*1 -6=4, 14=10*2 -6=14, etc. So, the last term is 484=10n -6=484, so 10n=490, n=49. So, 49 terms. So, units place for 4's is 49, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488=10n -2=488, so 10n=490, n=49. So, 49 terms, correct.\n\nTens place for 4's: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, and 5 such decades, so 50.\n\nTens place for 8's: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. The first four are 10 each, the last is 9, so total 49.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nHundreds place for 8's: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\n8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if I'm counting correctly in the hundreds place for 4's. 400-488 is 89 numbers because 488-400+1=89. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484) \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in decades like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 5 decades \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488) \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in decades like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 4 decades \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since pages go up to 488 \u2192 0 times.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Yes, because 4 is the 49th multiple of 10. So, from 4 to 484, that's 49 times. Wait, let me check: 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, but since we're including both endpoints, maybe it's better to calculate it as (484 - 4)/10 + 1. That would be (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is okay. Let's count each range:\n\n- 40-49: that's 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. So, 10 times.\n- 140-149: another 10 times.\n- 240-249: another 10 times.\n- 340-349: another 10 times.\n- 440-449: another 10 times.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 times, so 5\u00d710=50 times. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? The first number is 400, and the last is 488. So, the count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Wait, in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. Then, in the tens place, 50, and units place, 49. So, 89 + 50 = 139; 139 + 49 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many times that is. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, using the same method: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? Let's check each range:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, contributing 8 in the tens place. So, 10 times.\n- 180-189: another 10 times.\n- 280-289: another 10 times.\n- 380-389: another 10 times.\n- 480-488: how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 488 - 480 +1 = 9 numbers. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, total in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 +10 +9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because 188 seems high for 4's. Let me recount the 4's.\n\n- Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, step 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: that's 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That's correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49, correct.\n\n- Tens: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds: 0. So, total 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting in ranges, especially in the hundreds place, I might have made a mistake. Let me check the hundreds place for 4's again: from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89. Correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place of 8's: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - Numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total: 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Numbers: 400 to 488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - Numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences except 480-488, which contributes 9.\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, 484 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, maybe I should think of it as the number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. So, for each ten numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, how many tens are there? 480 divided by 10 is 48, so 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, we have 484 as the 49th occurrence. So, total 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But we're only concerned with the hundreds digit being 4, so each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is included, right? So, how many such numbers? The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last range. Let me count how many ranges: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: that's 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's 4 full ranges (each 10 numbers) and one partial range with 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait, 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 4 full ranges and one partial. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units place: 49, tens place:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for 8's. Wait, in the tens place, I had 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That's correct. So, 49 in tens place. Units place: same as 4's, 49. So, 98 total. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility I overcounted? For example, in the hundreds place for 4's, I counted 89 times because from 400 to 488 is 89 numbers. Let me confirm: 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. Yes, correct. So, 89 in hundreds place for 4's. For 8's, in the hundreds place, none, so 0. Units and tens places seem correct. So, the difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484) \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488) \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 4 full ranges \u00d7 10 + 9 (480-488) = 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number.\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, actually, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 49 times because 484 is the 49th occurrence (since 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4, but starting from 0, so 48+1=49). Wait, let me check that again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups. In each group, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So that's 48 times. But wait, in the last partial group, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which adds another occurrence. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there? The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks (from 0 to 4 in the hundreds place). Each block contributes 10 times 4 in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, let me check the upper limit. The last block is 440-449, which is within 488, so yes, 5 blocks. So 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, the last number is 488, which is included, so that's 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th occurrence. Let me think: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (1-480) and then 481-488. So in each full group, 8 appears once, so 48 times. Then, in 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, adding another 8. So total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is a partial block because it goes up to 488, not 489. Let's see how many full blocks there are. The first block is 80-89: 10 numbers. Then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: each is another 10 numbers. Then, 480-488: the tens digit is 8, but only from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Each full block (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 times. There are 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), contributing 4 * 10 = 40 times. Then, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers, so that's 9 times. So total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So yes, 9 times. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, the digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place at all. So, total hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 49 is 98? Wait, 49 + 49 is 98? Let me check: 49 + 49: 40 + 40 = 80, 9 + 9 = 18, so 80 + 18 = 98. Yes, that's correct. So, total 8's: 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. There are 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488. 0 occurrences.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's minus number of '8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Yes, because 484 is the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 4. Wait, let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms can be calculated by ((484 - 4)/10) + 1. So, (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one range, so 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is another 10, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, total in the tens place: 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8's in the tens place occur in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, we have to consider that. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 is the first, then 481,...,488, which is 9 numbers). So, total in the tens place: 10 +10+10+10+9=49. Wait, let me check again. From 1-99: 80-89:10. 100-199:180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9. So, total 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: Units: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total 4's: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total 8's:98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term 4 and the last term 484, common difference 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. The number of terms is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term 8 and the last term 488, common difference 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges each contribute 10 numbers, and the last range contributes 9 numbers (480-488). Total = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

That's (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers) From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers) From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers) From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count how many such ranges. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers) From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers) From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). Now, 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, we only go up to 488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the hundreds place 4, the tens digit 8 only goes from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens place 8's are: 4 ranges with 10 numbers each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 4*10=40, plus the 9 numbers from 480-488. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Therefore, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, the total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, ..., 484.

    "text": " Yes, because 484 is the 49th multiple. Wait, no, because starting from 4, each 10 numbers adds one. So, from 1 to 488, the number of 4's in the units place is the number of times 4 appears as the last digit. So, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? It's the floor of (488 / 10) which is 48, plus 1 if 488 itself ends with 4, but 488 ends with 8, so it's 48. Wait, no, actually, the count is the number of complete decades. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, the first occurrence is at 4, which is the 1st number, and the last occurrence in units place is 484, which is the 49th occurrence because 484 is the 49th number ending with 4. Wait, but 484 is the 49th number because from 4 to 484, that's 484 - 4 = 480, but divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 gives 49. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think differently. The number of numbers ending with 4 from 1 to N can be calculated as floor((N + 6)/10). Wait, maybe a better way is to see that every block of 10 numbers has exactly one number ending with 4. So, from 1 to 480, there are 48 such numbers (4,14,...,484). Then, from 481 to 488, does 484 fall into this range? Yes, 484 is within 481-488, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, total 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is included. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 49. Okay, I think that's correct. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but our book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so 440-449 is the last set. Each of these sets has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such sets are there? Let's see: the first set is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 1-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 sets, 50 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is only 4 for numbers 400-499, but since the book ends at 488, it's 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4 in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers has one ending with 8. From 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, and 488 ends with 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many full sets we have. The first set is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. The first four sets contribute 4 x 10 = 40 numbers. Now, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800-899, but our book goes only up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up the occurrences of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nYes, that seems correct.

    "text": " So, 484 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, maybe a better way is to calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. The pattern repeats every 10 numbers, so in each set of 10, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the number of sets is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, 48 sets, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last complete set is up to 480, and then 481 to 488. In the units place, 484 is within 481-488, so that's one more 4. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that seems off because 488/10 is 48.8, meaning 48 full sets and then 0.8 of a set, which would be 8 numbers beyond 480.

Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one set, contributing 10 4's. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to 4's, the first occurrence is 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, so in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included. So, 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is included in the units place count. So, units place 8's: 48 (from 1-480) +1 (488) = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. This occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. So, how many such ranges? From 1-99: 80-89, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, 10. From 200-299: 280-289, 10. From 300-399: 380-389, 10. From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers because 488-480=8, so 8+1=9. So, in the hundreds place, each of the first four ranges contributes 10 8's, and the last range contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That's correct. Units place: 49. So, 49+49=98. Yes, that's correct. So, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10 (480 numbers) and 8 additional numbers (481-488).\n   - In the units place, 4 appears 48 times in the full sets and once in the additional numbers (484).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers.\n   - Ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 5 ranges.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10 and 8 additional numbers (481-488).\n   - In the units place, 8 appears 48 times in the full sets and once in the additional numbers (488).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers.\n   - Ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last range (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, actually, it's 49 times because starting from 4 as the first, the next is 14 as the second, and so on, up to 484 as the 49th. Wait, let me check that again. If I take 484 divided by 10, that's 48.4, so the integer part is 48, but since 484 is included, it's actually 49 times. Alternatively, I can think of it as the number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. The formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is floor((n + 1)/10). So, for 488, it's floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10) = 48. Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Hmm, maybe I should list some examples. From 1 to 10, 4 appears once (at 4). From 11 to 20, 4 appears once (at 14). So, every block of 10 numbers contributes one 4 in the units place. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But wait, in the last block, from 481 to 490, but our book stops at 488, so the units place 4 in 484 is still within 488. So, does that mean it's 48 times? Wait, let me think again. From 1 to 480, how many 4's in the units place? 480/10 = 48. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is the 49th occurrence. So, actually, it's 49 times. Hmm, maybe the formula is floor((n)/10) + 1 if the last digit is >=4. Wait, no, perhaps it's better to calculate it as follows: The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete tens plus one if the units digit of the last number is >=4. So, 488 has a units digit of 8, which is >=4, so it's 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where 4 is in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there? From 1-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many blocks? Let's see: 40-49: 10 numbers. 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers where 4 is in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 times. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so all 10 numbers are included. So, that's 5 blocks, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Wait, but let me confirm. 400 is the first, 401, ..., up to 488. So, yes, 89 numbers. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times? The last number is 488, which is included. So, from 1 to 488, how many multiples of 10 plus 8 are there? That's similar to the 4's. The formula would be floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10) = 48. But wait, let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete tens, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But 488 is included, so does that mean 49 times? Wait, 8, 18, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But wait, our book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488. So, how many blocks? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). Wait, no: 480 is the first, then 481, ..., up to 488. So, that's 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. Wait, but let me think again. The blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 5 blocks. The first four blocks each contribute 10 numbers, and the last block contributes 9. So, total is 4 x 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where 8 is in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. This is 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. This is 89 occurrences.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This is 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as there are no pages 800-899. This is 0 occurrences.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, actually, the number of 4's in the units place is 49. Wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 480, that's 480 numbers, which would have 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place (since 480 / 10 = 48). Then, in the next 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once at 484. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place, 4 can appear in the tens digit every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449, and also in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, we'll have to adjust that. Let's see: From 1-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers, so that's 10 occurrences. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249 is 10. 300-399: 340-349 is 10. 400-488: 440-449 is 10, and then 480-488 would have 480-488, but since 488 is the last page, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but wait, the tens digit in 480-488 is 8, not 4. So, actually, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, adding up: 10 (from 40-49) + 10 (140-149) + 10 (240-249) + 10 (340-349) + 10 (440-449) = 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see: From 1-488, how many 8's are there in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, the last 8 is at 488. So, starting from 8, 18, ..., 488: that's 49 occurrences. Wait, let me confirm: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus the last number 488, which adds one more, making it 49. So, units place 8's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens digit. 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last group is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Let's count: From 1-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189 is 10. 200-299: 280-289 is 10. 300-399: 380-389 is 10. 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't miss anything. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - From 1 to 480, there are 48 occurrences (480 / 10 = 48).\n   - Including 484, there is 1 more occurrence.\n   - **Total in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - From 1-99: 10 occurrences.\n   - From 100-199: 10 occurrences.\n   - From 200-299: 10 occurrences.\n   - From 300-399: 10 occurrences.\n   - From 400-488: 10 occurrences (440-449).\n   - **Total in tens place:** 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (488 / 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n   - **Total in units place:** 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block which contributes 9 (480-488).\n   - From 1-99: 10 occurrences.\n   - From 100-199: 10 occurrences.\n   - From 200-299: 10 occurrences.\n   - From 300-399: 10 occurrences.\n   - From 400-488: 9 occurrences (480-488).\n   - **Total in tens place:** 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Yes, because 484 is the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 4. Wait, no, actually, 484 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 4 (1st), 14 (2nd), ..., 484 (49th). So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Let me check that: from 4 to 484, that's 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 gives 48, plus 1 gives 49. Yep, that's correct. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many full ranges we have. The first range is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 occurrences. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. Let's see, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours printed. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. Let's calculate how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's check each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: How many numbers? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, total tens place occurrences: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero occurrences of 8 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, there are 98 eights printed. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. This is 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. This is 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number (since the book ends at 488). This is 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me check: 484 is the 49th occurrence because it's the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4. Wait, no, actually, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete groups of 10, which is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48 times. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10, and the 49th group is only up to 488. So, in each group, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times from 1 to 480, and then 488 is the next number, which is 488, but 488's units digit is 8, not 4. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so the number of times 4 appears in the hundreds place is 89. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's calculate how many times. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many numbers? From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10, so the number of 8's in the units place is 48 (from 8 to 488, stepping by 10). Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8*1=8, 8*2=18,...,8*49=488. Wait, no, because 8*49 is 392, which is not 488. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Let me think differently. The number of 8's in the units place is equal to the number of times 8 appears as the last digit, which is once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many full groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is the 49th number where the units digit is 8, because 8*1=8, 8*2=18,...,8*49=392, but wait, that's not right because 8*49=392, which is less than 488. Wait, no, 8*1=8, 8*2=18,...,8*48=384, and 8*49=392, which is still less than 488. Wait, but 488 is 8*61=488. Wait, no, that's not correct because 8*61=488, but that's not the way to count the number of 8's in the units place. Let me correct this. The number of 8's in the units place is the number of times the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear as the units digit? It's the integer division of 488 by 10, which is 48, and then check if the last number (488) has units digit 8. Yes, 488 does, so we add 1 more. So, total units place 8's: 48 +1=49. Wait, that makes sense because 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 can appear in the tens place. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except possibly the last one if it's cut short. Let's count: From 1-99: 80-89, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the end. So, in the hundreds place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, how many 8's in the tens place here? 9. So, total tens place 8's: 10 (from 80-89) +10+10+10 (from 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) +9 (from 480-488) = 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, that's 49. Let me check: 10 (80-89) +10 (180-189) +10 (280-289) +10 (380-389) +9 (480-488) = 49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The page numbers go up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. 8 is not among these, so the hundreds digit is never 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the number of 4's was 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. Correct. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. Correct. So, 187-98=89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Count the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 48 such numbers (from 1 to 480) plus one more at 484, totaling 48 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n2. **Count the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers (including 488).\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last range (480-488) contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since page numbers go up to 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Yes, because 484 is the 48th occurrence when counting every 10 numbers. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488 is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488, which is 48 full groups (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8). Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, which is 488. The units digit here is 8, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 300-399: 340-349, and 400-488: 440-449. So, that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times. Wait, but in the last block, 440-449, does 449 exist? Since the book goes up to 488, yes, 449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens from 400-488. Each number in this range has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. To find the count, I can calculate (488 - 8) / 10 + 1. That's (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49 times. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Each block contributes 10 occurrences except the last one, which contributes 9 (since 488 is the last page). Let's see: From 0-99: 80-89 is one block, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, total in tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 times. Wait, but let me double-check. The first four blocks each have 10, so 4\u00d710=40, plus the last block has 9, so 40+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, tens place: 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 can't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 0 (for pages 1-99), 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units place: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 187. For the 8's: units:49, tens:49, total 98. Difference:187-98=89. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

    "text": " So actually, from 4 to 484, the number of 4's in the units place is 49. Wait, let me check that. The number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is given by ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. So here, first term is 4, last term is 484, common difference is 10. So ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in this range, the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, but the hundreds place is only the first digit. So, each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times. Now, let me add up all the 4's: units place:49, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. Total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many. First term is 8, last term is 488. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences. How many such ranges? From 0-99: 80-89, that's 10. From 100-199:180-189, another 10. 200-299:280-289, another 10. 300-399:380-389, another 10. Now, 400-488: does 480-489 fall within 488? 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the hundreds place, 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, the total is 4 ranges of 10 each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 in 480-488. So that's 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the 8's: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds place:0. Total 8's=49+49+0=98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, that's 5 groups of 10 numbers each, totaling 50 times. Wait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 is another 10, 340-349 is another 10, and 440-449 is another 10. So, 5*10=50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, 401, 402,... up to 488. So, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the book, so let's count how many full groups and the partial group. From 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189: 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289: 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389: 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-488: how many numbers? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens place in 480-488 has 9 numbers where 8 is in the tens place. So, total for tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40 plus 9 is 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400-488. So, the hundreds digit never is 8 in this book because the highest page is 488, which is in the 400s. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n1. **Counting '4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. There are 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting '8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place. There are 0 occurrences.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{90}"

So, yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the blocks are: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is actually 10 numbers, right? 440, 441, ..., 449. So, yes, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. Again, considering units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, which is the 1st, then 18 is the 2nd, and so on. The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 8 is 1, 18 is 2, ..., 488 is 49. Yes, that's correct. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-489 would be 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Let me check: 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers. So, the tens place blocks are: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the book.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as pages go up to 488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Yes, because 484 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488 is calculated by dividing 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups (each group having one 4 in the units place) and then checking if there's a partial group. Since 488 ends with 8, the last full group is 480-488, but the 4 in the units place occurs at 484, which is within this group. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 (from 4 to 484). Wait, actually, when you divide 488 by 10, you get 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but the 48th 4 would be at 480 + 4 = 484, right? So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many full ranges there are. The first range is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units: 4,14,24,...,484: 48 numbers. Tens: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5*10=50. Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So total 48+50+89=187 4's. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Wait, 488 is included, so yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. So, how many full ranges? Let's see: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers, since 480 is the start, 481, ...,488). So, the first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9. So, total 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: Units: 48, Tens:50, Hundreds:89, total 187. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0, total 98. Difference: 187-98=89. Hmm, but wait, let me check the tens place for 8's again. When I was counting the tens place, I considered 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. That's 4*10 +9=49, which seems correct. Similarly, for units place, 8,18,...,488: from 8 to 488, step 10. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So that's correct. For 4's, units:48, because 484 is the last one, which is 48th term (4,14,...,484). Tens:50, because 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449, each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Hundreds:400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 48+50+89=187. So, yes, the difference is 187-98=89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - Number of terms: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{484}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such ranges: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488.  \n   - Number of terms: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\nTotal 4's: \\( 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - Number of terms: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488 - 8}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.  \n   - First four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in page numbers up to 488: \\( 0 \\).\n\nTotal 8's: \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**  \n\\( 187 \\text{ (4's)} - 98 \\text{ (8's)} = 89 \\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Yes, because 484 is the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 4. Wait, let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10 numbers) in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete decades. But in each decade, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, the last page is 488, which is in the 48th decade (480-489). Since 488 is within that, the units digit 4 appears 48 times. Wait, but 488 is included, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the 48th occurrence would be 480-489, which is 10 numbers, so actually, it's 49 times? Wait, no, because 488 is the last page. Let me check: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first 4 is at 4, then every 10 numbers: 14, 24, ..., 484. So, the number of 4's in the units place is the number of times 4 appears as the units digit. The last such number is 484, which is the 49th occurrence because 484 is the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 4 (4,14,...,484). Wait, no, 4 is the first, 14 the second, ..., 484 is the (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49th occurrence. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 40-49: that's one range. Then 140-149: another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 440-449, which is entirely within 488. So, 5 ranges, 10 numbers each, so 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, the total number of 4's is the sum of the units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 8. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. However, the book ends at 488, so the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers instead of 10. So, let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 times. Therefore, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For the 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Yes, because 484 is the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 4. Wait, let me check: from 4 to 484, how many steps of 10? The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers.

That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, there are 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last range. Each full range (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 numbers, but the last one, 480-488, only contributes 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 full ranges and one partial. So, total 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, yes, 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For the 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when I counted the 8's in the tens place, I included 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 488 is the last page. So, that's 9 numbers, not 10. So, 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) give 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. That's correct. Similarly, for the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, which is correct because 488-400+1=89. So, the counts seem accurate. Therefore, the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range contributes 10, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The last range contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No occurrences as pages go up to 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " So, 484 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 4 as the first, each subsequent 10 numbers adds another 4 in the units place. So, units place has 49 occurrences of 4. Wait, let me check that. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. The number of complete cycles is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. So, 48 complete cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place, totaling 48. Then, in the incomplete cycle from 481 to 488, the units digit 4 occurs once at 484. So, total 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, that makes sense. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check the last block. 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's valid. So, tens place contributes 50 4's. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8's appear every 10 numbers. From 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 is included. So, how many 8's in the units place? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, the number of occurrences is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that's the same as the 4's in units place. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit being 8. That occurs in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. So, how many blocks? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. The last block, 480-488, contributes 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), so 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus 9, totaling 49. Wait, but wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit being 8. Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. It never reaches 8, so there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.  \n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.  \n   - Total numbers: 89.  \n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9.  \n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by **\\boxed{90}**."

    "text": " So actually, from 4 to 484, that's 49 times. Wait, let me check: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first block, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks in total. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, I need to check if 440-449 is within the 488-page limit. 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49.

Let's count the blocks: 80-89 is the first, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, so 4 \u00d710 = 40. But wait, does 380-389 end before 488? Yes, 389 is less than 488, so all 4 blocks are included. So, 40 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up all the occurrences of 8: 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 89. So, there are 89 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 89 = 99.

    "text": " Yes, because 484 is the 49th number where 4 is in the units place. So, actually, it's 49 times. Wait, let me think again. From 4 to 484, how many steps of 10? The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Yes, so 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is fully within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each number here has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many times this happens. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers. 180-189 is another 10. 280-289 is another 10. 380-389 is another 10. Now, 480-488: how many numbers here? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, instead of 10, it's 9. So, the tens place contributions are: 10 (from 80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " Yes, because 484 is the 49th number where the units digit is 4. Wait, let me check: from 4 to 484, that's 484 - 4 + 1 = 481 numbers, but only every 10th number has a 4 in the units place. So, 481 / 10 = 48.1, but since we can't have a fraction, it's 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then one more at 484. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid, but 480-489 would be beyond 488. Let's see how many full decades we have. Each set of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has a block where the tens digit is 4. For 1-100: 40-49, that's 10 numbers. For 101-200: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times. The last occurrence is at 488, so 488 - 8 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 gives 49. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Let's count how many full decades we have. Each set of 100 numbers contributes a block where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, how many times does the tens digit 8 appear? For the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributes 10 numbers, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 times. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Yes, because 484 is the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 4. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, let me check: from 4 to 484, that's 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Yes, that's correct. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count these. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100, there are 10 such numbers. From 101-200, another 10, and so on. Since the book goes up to 488, let's see how many complete hundreds we have. 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 401-488. How many complete hundreds are there? Up to 400, that's four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last block, 401-488, how many numbers have 4 in the tens place? That's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 401-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, adding 10 to the previous 40 gives 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 occurrences of the digit 4. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. To find the number of terms: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count these. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-100: 10 numbers, 101-200: 10, 201-300: 10, 301-400: 10. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Now, in the last block, 401-488, does the tens digit 8 occur? Let's see: 480-489 would be the range, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, 480-488 contributes 9 occurrences of 8. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above. But since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences here. Now, adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 occurrences of the digit 8. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check the tens place for 8's. In the range 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. So, that's 480, 481, ..., 488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 occurrences in the tens place for the last block. So, total tens place: 40 (from the first four blocks) + 9 = 49. Units place: 49, Tens place: 49, Hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Yes, because 484 is the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 4. Wait, no, actually, let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488 can be calculated by considering how many complete groups of 10 there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last group is 480-488. The units digits go from 0 to 8, so the 4 in the units place occurs once in each group. So, total units place 4's: 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 have a 4 in the units place? No, it's 8. So, actually, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 because each group of 10 has exactly one 4 in the units place, and there are 48 such groups from 1 to 480, and then 481-488 don't add another 4 in the units place. Wait, but 488 is included, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let me think differently. The number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of times 4 appears in each set of 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so that's 48. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no 4 in the units place. So total 4's in units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 fit within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, total 4's in the tens place: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, I'll do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, but let's check. The 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so in the last group (481-490), but since the book ends at 488, the units digit 8 occurs at 488. So, from 1 to 488, how many 8's in the units place? Each group of 10 contributes one 8, so 488 /10 = 48.8, which means 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, no. Wait, 1 to 488: The first occurrence is 8, then 18, ..., 488. So, how many numbers is that? The number of 8's in the units place is equal to the number of times 8 appears in the units digit from 1 to 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490). But since we only go up to 488, the last group is 481-488. In each group, the units digit 8 appears once, except possibly the last group if it's incomplete. But in this case, 488 is the last page, so the units digit 8 appears once in the last group as well. So, total units place 8's: 48 +1=49? Wait, no, because from 1-480, there are 48 groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so that's 48. Then, from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 is included, which is the 49th occurrence. So, total units place 8's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except possibly the last one. Let's count: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. - 180-189: 10 numbers, another 10. - 280-289: 10 numbers, another 10. - 380-389: 10 numbers, another 10. - 480-488: Here, the tens digit is 8 for all numbers from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, so that's 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: From 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's. From 180-189: 10. From 280-289:10. From 380-389:10. From 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49+49=98. But earlier, I had 187 4's and 98 8's. So, the difference would be 187-98=89. But let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake here. Let me recount the 4's: Units place: 48, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place:89. Total 4's: 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. Now for 8's: Units place:49, Tens place:49, Hundreds place:0. Total 8's:49+49=98. Wait, that's 98 8's. So, the difference is 187-98=89. But wait, let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but how many numbers is that? 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place, so 9 8's. So, adding up the tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. Similarly, units place:49, so total 8's:98. So, the difference is 187-98=89. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the hundreds place for 4's was 89, which is a lot. Let me check that again. The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. Yes, that's correct. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. So, total 4's:48+50+89=187. 8's:49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. When counting the units place for 8's, I included 488, which is correct. For the tens place, I included 480-488, which is 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, 9 there. So, yes, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, total 98. So, 187-98=89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " So, actually, from 4 to 484, each 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place. So, the number of 4's in the units place is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Wait, but 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4, so maybe it's 49 times? Let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one range, contributing 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another, another 10. Similarly, 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 1-488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. But wait, let me check the last range: 440-449. The next page after that is 450, which is within 488, so yes, that's valid. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, does 488 count? Yes, because the last page is 488. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that range. So, each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers, except the last one, which might be less. Let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in the tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9, so 4\u00d710 +9=40+9=49. Wait, but let me think again. From 1-99: 80-89 is 10. 100-199:180-189 is 10. 200-299:280-289 is 10. 300-399:380-389 is 10. 400-488:480-488 is 9. So, total is 4\u00d710 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, zero times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=49+49=98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90.

    "text": " Yes, because 484 is the 49th number where the units digit is 4. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place up to 488 can be calculated by taking the total number of pages, which is 488, and dividing by 10, then taking the floor of that. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, which floors to 48. But wait, 488 is included, so when the units digit is 4, it's 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. So, from 4 to 484, how many numbers? The number of terms in this sequence is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Oh, so I was wrong earlier. It's actually 49 times. Hmm, so maybe my initial approach was off. Let me correct that. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 49. Similarly, for the tens place, the 4 can appear in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one block, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers (440 to 449). So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 times. Now, for the hundreds place, the 4 appears in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. But in each of these, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, let me add that again: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that happens. The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? The formula is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488). So, let's count each block: - 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. - 100-199: 180-189 is 10. - 200-299: 280-289 is 10. - 300-399: 380-389 is 10. - 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's recount the 4's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the tens place for 4's again. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. For hundreds place, 400-488: 488-400+1=89 numbers, so 89 4's in hundreds place. Correct. For 8's, tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, 4 full blocks of 10 and one partial block of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct. Units place: 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, plus 1=49. Correct. So, 49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   Number of occurrences = \u230a488/10\u230b = 48, but since 484 is included, it's 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in 400-488.  \n   Number of occurrences = 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   Number of occurrences = \u230a488/10\u230b = 48, plus 1 for 488, totaling 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   Each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last contributes 9.  \n   Total = 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, there are 49 times that 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's one range, 140-149: another, 240-249: another, 340-349: another, and 440-449: another. That's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 440-449, which is within 488. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 in 400-499, but the book only goes up to 488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. Therefore, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Each full range (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers, so let's count them. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10. That's 4 ranges, each contributing 10, so 40. Now, the last range is 480-488, which has 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, adding that, 40 + 9 = 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero occurrences of 8 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. That seems right. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, from 400 to 488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 times in the hundreds place. And in the tens place, for 4's, I had 5 ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each has 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50. That seems correct. For 8's, in the tens place, I had 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4 x 10 = 40, plus 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct. So, yes, 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. Let me check again. The ranges for 8 in the tens place are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, that's 5 ranges, not 4. Because 480-488 is the fifth range. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, that's correct. So, 49 in the tens place for 8's. So, total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the digit '4':**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Yes, because 484 is the 49th number where the units digit is 4. So, units place contributes 49 times the digit 4. Wait, let me check that again. From 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra in the last incomplete decade. The total number of decades is 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8). But in each decade, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th occurrence because 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4. Wait, no, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 4 is in the units place every 10 numbers starting from 4. So, 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. How many terms? Let's see: The first term is 4, which is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 times in the units place. Hmm, I think my initial thought was wrong. So, 49 times for the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10. Continuing up to 440-449, which is another 10. Now, what about beyond that? The next would be 540-549, but since the book only goes up to 488, we don't have that. So, how many blocks are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first block, 140-149 is the second, 240-249 third, 340-349 fourth, and 440-449 fifth. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 blocks, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is calculated as follows: The nth term is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many full blocks there are. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the Digit 4:**\n1. **Units Place:** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

    "text": " Yes, because 484 is the 49th number where the units digit is 4. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 49. Wait, let me check: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, that's correct. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included. Let me count how many times the tens digit is 4. Each block of 100 numbers (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has a block where the tens digit is 4. From 1-100: 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, from 101-200: 140-149, another 10. From 201-300: 240-249, another 10. From 301-400: 340-349, another 10. Then from 401-488: 440-449, which is another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many hundreds are there? From 1-400, that's four hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Then from 401-488, which is part of the fifth hundred, but only up to 488. But in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total number of 4's in the tens place is 4 (hundreds) * 10 = 40? Wait, no, because from 1-400, each hundred contributes 10, so 4 hundreds would give 40. Then from 401-488, another 10, making it 50. Wait, but 401-488 is part of the 400-499 range, but since the book ends at 488, 440-449 is included. So, yes, 50 in total for the tens place. Wait, but let me check again. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 1-100: 40-49 \u2192 10. 101-200: 140-149 \u2192 10. 201-300: 240-249 \u219210. 301-400:340-349 \u219210. 401-488:440-449 \u219210. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens from page 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, let me add up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many times this happens. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is included. Let's count each block. From 1-100: 80-89 \u219210 numbers. 101-200:180-189 \u219210. 201-300:280-289 \u219210. 301-400:380-389 \u219210. 401-488:480-488 \u21929 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, let me check: 480 is the first, then 481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9. So, total in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (from 1-400) and 1 block of 9 (from 401-488). So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=49+50=99+89=188. For the 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but let me check the tens place for 4's again. I thought from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's correct, adding up to 50 in the tens place. Similarly, for the 8's, in the tens place, from 401-488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, yes, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.

There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks have 10 each, and the last block has 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Yes, because 484 is the 48th occurrence in the units place. Wait, no, actually, if I start counting from 4 as the first occurrence, then 4,14,...,484 would be 484/10 = 48.4, but since 484 is included, it's 48 + 1 = 49? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in the range, plus any extra if the last number is beyond that. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups. Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 484 fall within 488? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is page 488, which has an 8 in the units place, not a 4. So, the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the tens place is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 449 is less than 488, so all 10 are included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens in the numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, 8,18,28,...,488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is 488, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 488 is the last page, so 380-389 is within 488, but 480-489 is beyond 488, so only up to 389. So, how many such ranges? 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. But wait, let's check if 380-389 is within 488. Yes, 389 is less than 488, so all 10 numbers are included. So, 40 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800-899, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up the occurrences of 8: units (48) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 40 = 88. So, 88 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 88 (number of 8's) = 99. So, there are 99 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 40 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as there are no 800-899 pages.\n- **Total 8's:** 48 + 40 = 88.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of 4's) - 88 (number of 8's) = 99.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{99}"

    "text": " So, actually, from 4 to 484, the number of 4's in the units place is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range, so yes, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. Starting from 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many ranges? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449: that's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. However, wait, 440-449: the last page is 488, so 449 is within range, so all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have a 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. However, I think I need to check if 400 is included. Since the first page is 1, yes, 400 is page 400, so it's included. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many. The last occurrence is 488, so (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these contributes 10 numbers. Let's count the ranges. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. Now, does 480-489 fall within the 488 pages? Yes, up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. So, 480-489 would have been another 10, but since the book ends at 488, how many numbers are there? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the 480-489 range contributes only 9 numbers. So, total ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 ranges. For the first four, each contributes 10, and the last contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the hundreds place with 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Yes, because 484 is the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 4. So, units place gives us 49 occurrences of 4. Wait, let me check that again. If I consider 4 as the first occurrence, then 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Yes, that's correct. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5*10 = 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers. Let's see how many such ranges are there. From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). Now, 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the last number is 488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the hundreds place of 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many full ranges do we have? 4 ranges (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389), each contributing 10, and then 480-488 contributing 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is within 400-488, so the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens place for 8 has 49 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only when the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences for 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number \u2192 0 times.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
