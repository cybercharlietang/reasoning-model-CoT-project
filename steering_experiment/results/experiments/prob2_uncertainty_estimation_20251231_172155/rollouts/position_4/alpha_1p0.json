    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every 10 pages, the digits 0 through 9 appear once in the units place. So, for example, pages 1-10 have 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0 in the units place. This means that each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in the units place every 10 pages. Now, how many complete sets of 10 pages are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 pages and then 8 extra pages (481 to 488). \n\nIn each complete set of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 appears once as well. So, for 48 complete sets, the number of 4's in the units place would be 48, and the same for 8's. Now, looking at the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these extra pages, the digit 4 appears once (on page 484) and the digit 8 appears once (on page 488). Therefore, in the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's, so 49 as well. Wait, that can't be right because 488 is included, so maybe I need to check that again. Let me recount: from 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 each. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So yes, units place has 49 4's and 49 8's. Hmm, so that's equal so far.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digits go from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 pages. So, for each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. Now, 488 pages mean we have four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, that's actually five hundreds, but the last one is only up to 488. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of complete hundreds and then the remaining pages.\n\nLet's see, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are four complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages in the fifth hundred (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit in the tens place cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and the same for 8 (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, in four complete hundreds, the digit 4 appears 4 times 10, which is 40 times in the tens place, and the same for 8, so 40 each.\n\nNow, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? From 440-449, that's 10 times, right? But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 pages where the tens digit is 4. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in the remaining 88 pages. Similarly, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? From 480-488, that's 9 pages (480-488 inclusive), so the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages. Wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 pages, correct. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in the remaining 88 pages.\n\nTherefore, total in the tens place: 4's are 40 (from four hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. 8's are 40 (from four hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49. So, in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 49. That means 4's are one more in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, 400-488 would have hundreds digit 4. So, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. How about 8 in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears zero times in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4's are 89 and 8's are 0. So, that's 89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts from each place.\n\nUnits place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49. So, difference is 0.\n\nTens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 49. Difference is +1.\n\nHundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0. Difference is +89.\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check each step again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 pages, so hundreds digit is 4, so 89 times. But 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So, yes, 89 4's and 0 8's in hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. So, difference +1.\n\nUnits place: 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 +1 =49 for 4's, same for 8's. So, difference 0.\n\nSo, total differences: 0 (units) +1 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times 4 appears in hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, when I count the hundreds place, I should consider that 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, adding up the differences: units 0, tens +1, hundreds +89, total +90.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made a mistake in the units place. From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEach 10 pages, 4 appears once, so 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 times in complete sets, and then in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), 4 appears once at 484. So, 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears once every 10 pages, so 48 times, and once at 488, so 48 +1=49. So, units place: 49 each, difference 0.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 complete hundreds: 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), 4 appears 10 times (440-449), so total 50. 8 appears 10 times in each hundred, so 4*10=40, and in the last partial hundred, 8 appears 9 times (480-488), so total 40 +9=49. So, tens place: 50 vs 49, difference +1.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times, difference +89.\n\nSo, total difference: 0 +1 +89=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count any pages. For example, page 440 is counted in both tens and hundreds places, but each digit is considered separately, so that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the total number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract.\n\nLet me try that approach to verify.\n\nTotal number of 4's:\n\nUnits place: 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4, so 48. Plus, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), 4 appears once (484). So, units:49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4 complete hundreds: 4*10=40. In the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10. So, total tens:40+10=50.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)= 188.\n\nSimilarly, total number of 8's:\n\nUnits place: 488 /10=48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Plus, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), 8 appears once (488). So, units:49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 complete hundreds:4*10=40. In the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488), so 9. So, total tens:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 8 never appears, as the book ends at 488, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90.\n\nSo, that confirms it. There are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 90, so that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - 488 pages = 48 complete sets of 10 pages + 8 extra pages.\n   - 4's: 48 (from sets) + 1 (484) = 49.\n   - 8's: 48 (from sets) + 1 (488) = 49.\n   - Difference: 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - 488 pages = 4 complete hundreds + 88 extra pages.\n   - 4's: 4*10 (from hundreds) + 10 (440-449) = 50.\n   - 8's: 4*10 (from hundreds) + 9 (480-488) = 49.\n   - Difference: +1.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - 4's: 89.\n   - 8's: 0.\n   - Difference: +89.\n\nTotal difference: 0 (units) + 1 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 90.\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think about how many digits each page number has.\n\nFor pages 1 through 9, they are single-digit numbers. So, from 1 to 9, each page number is just one digit. Then, from page 10 to page 99, those are two-digit numbers. After that, from page 100 to page 488, those are three-digit numbers. So, I need to consider each of these ranges separately when counting the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nI think the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers, and then do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each position one by one.\n\nFirst, the units place. For the units digit, the 4 can appear in every set of 10 numbers. For example, in 1-10, the 4 is in 4; in 11-20, it's in 14, and so on. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place from 1 to 488?\n\nWell, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. Each group of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a digit, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but actually, 488 is exactly 48 full groups of 10, right? Because 48 x 10 is 480, and then we have 8 more numbers from 481 to 488. So, in those 480 numbers, there are 48 4's in the units place, and then in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so no 4's there. So, total 4's in units place are 48.\n\nNext, the tens place. The 4 in the tens place appears in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks is 10 numbers, and the 4 is in the tens place for all of them.\n\nLet me count how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's a total of 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The 4 in the hundreds place appears in numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds. That would be 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many 8's are in the units place?\n\nAgain, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups. Each group contributes one 8, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The 8 in the tens place appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488.\n\nLet me count how many such blocks. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the end). So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place, and the last block contributes 9.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4 x 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The 8 in the hundreds place would appear in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so 49 + 49 is 98. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the units place for 8's. Earlier, I thought that from 1 to 488, each 10 numbers contribute one 8 in the units place, so 48 times, and then in the last partial group, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks is 10 numbers, contributing 10 8's each, so 4 x 10 = 40. The last block, 480-488, is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nNow, the total number of 4's is 187, and the total number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 times. Because from 1-480, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place, so 480 / 10 = 48. Then, 481-488 doesn't add any, so 48 total.\n\n- Tens place: 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Units place: From 1-480, 480 / 10 = 48 8's. Then, in 481-488, 488 is the last number, which has an 8 in the units place, so 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens place: Blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, so 4 x 10 = 40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers, so 9 8's. Total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: No 8's, since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When counting the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's there. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the tens place, the 480-488 block contributes 9 8's because 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, 9 8's there.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is actually 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, yes, 9 numbers. So, 9 8's in the tens place from that block.\n\nSo, adding up, 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I think about page numbers, sometimes the hundreds digit is 4, but maybe I'm overcounting somewhere. Let me try another approach to verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's digit by digit, considering each position separately.\n\nStarting with the units digit:\n\nFor 4's in units place: As before, every 10 numbers have one 4. So, total 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no additional 4's. So, 48 4's.\n\nFor 8's in units place: Similarly, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers, 488 is the last, which has an 8 in the units place, so 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, tens digit:\n\nFor 4's in tens place: The 4 in the tens place occurs in blocks of 100, specifically in the decades where the tens digit is 4. So, in each hundred, the 4 in the tens place occurs in 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n\nFrom 1-488, how many such blocks are there? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 full hundreds. But actually, the blocks are 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nIn each of the first four blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), there's one block where the tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349. Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4 blocks x 10 = 40.\n\nThen, in the last block, 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8. So, when the tens digit is 4, that's 440-449. That's another 10 numbers, so 10 more 4's. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought there were 5 blocks, but now I'm counting 4 blocks in the first 400 numbers and one more in 400-488, making it 5 blocks. So, 5 x 10 = 50. That's correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place: Similarly, the 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n\nEach of the first four blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 x 10 = 40.\n\nIn the last block, 480-488, the tens digit is 8, so the numbers are 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, hundreds digit:\n\nFor 4's in hundreds place: From 400-488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place. The count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's.\n\nFor 8's in hundreds place: Since the book ends at 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nNow, adding up:\n\nTotal 4's: Units (48) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187.\n\nTotal 8's: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I missed anything. For example, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4. So, 89 is correct.\n\nIn the tens place for 4's, I had 5 blocks of 10, so 50, which seems right.\n\nIn the units place for 4's, 48, correct.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 49, tens place: 49, so 98 total.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me start by thinking about how often each digit (4 and 8) appears in each place. I'll probably need to calculate the number of times 4 appears in the units place, then in the tens place, and then in the hundreds place. I'll do the same for 8 and then compare the totals.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. Now, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and then an extra 8 pages. But wait, in each complete block, 4 and 8 each appear once. So for units place, 4 appears 48 times, and 8 appears 48 times. But wait, in the incomplete block (pages 481 to 488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So 4 appears once (page 484) and 8 appears once (page 488). So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's are 48 +1 = 49. So in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. So the difference here is zero.\n\nNext, the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each block of 100. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in each block of 100, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times. Now, how many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). \n\nSo, in each of the 4 complete blocks, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so 4*10=40 times. Similarly, 8 appears 4*10=40 times. Now, in the incomplete block (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Wait, let's see: 401-410: tens digit is 0, 411-420: 1, 421-430:2, 431-440:3, 441-450:4, 451-460:5, 461-470:6, 471-480:7, 481-490:8, but wait, our last page is 488, so 481-488 would have tens digit 8 for pages 481-488, which is 8 pages. So in the tens place for the incomplete block, 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. 8 appears in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 pages, so 8 times. Therefore, in the tens place, 4 appears 40 +10=50 times, and 8 appears 40 +8=48 times. So the difference in tens place is 50 -48=2. So 4's are appearing 2 more times than 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. Wait, so 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 -400 +1=89). So how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? 89 times. Now, does 8 ever appear in the hundreds place? Since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, summing up:\n\n- Units place: 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n- Tens place: 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 48 times.\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 +48 +0 =97\n\nSo the difference is 188 -97=91.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again, especially the hundreds place. Wait, 400-488 is 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. For the incomplete block, 401-488, the tens digit for 441-450 is 4, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. For 481-488, the tens digit is 8, which is 8 pages, so 8 times. So 4's in tens place: 40 (from complete blocks) +10=50, 8's:40 +8=48. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place: Each complete block of 10 contributes 1 each, and the last partial block contributes 1 each, so 49 each.\n\nSo total 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete blocks of 10 in 488 pages: 48 blocks.\n   - Each block contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488): units digits include 4 and 8 once each.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Complete blocks of 100: 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400).\n   - Each block contributes 10 4's and 10 8's.\n   - Remaining 88 pages (401-488): tens digits include 4 (10 times) and 8 (8 times).\n   - Total 4's: 4\u00d710 +10 =50\n   - Total 8's:4\u00d710 +8 =48\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 1-399: hundreds digit is 1,2,3 (no 4 or 8).\n   - Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4 (89 times).\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's:89\n   - Total 8's:0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188\n- 8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=97\n\n**Difference:**188 -97=91\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Wait, actually, page 1 is the first page, and page 488 is the last one. So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears, then find the difference between those two counts.\n\nLet me start by understanding how digits are counted in numbers. I remember that when counting digits, it's helpful to consider each digit position separately: units, tens, hundreds, etc. So, I'll need to analyze each position for both 4 and 8.\n\nFirst, let's consider the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times a specific digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then considering any remainder.\n\nWait, but since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, that means there are 48 full sets of 10 pages and then 8 extra pages. So, for the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times, and then for the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times, and the digit 8 appears 48 times as well, plus one more time in the remaining 8 pages because 488 has an 8 in the units place. Wait, no, 488 is page 488, so the units digit is 8, so in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, the digit 4 appears once more in the units place, and 8 appears once more. So, total units place counts: 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so the units digits go up to 8, so yes, 488 is included.\n\nWait, but actually, the total number of units digits is 488, so each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times in the units place, except that the last partial set (481-488) affects the count. Wait, no, actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488) have units digits 1 through 8, so in these, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So, total units place: 4 appears 48 +1=49 times, and 8 appears 48 +1=49 times.\n\nWait, but wait, 488 is included, so 488's units digit is 8, so yes, that adds one more 8. So, units place: 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) and then 1-9 for 10-99, each appearing 10 times. Then, from 100-199, the tens digit cycles again, and so on.\n\nSo, for the tens place, each digit appears 10 times per hundred. Since the book has 488 pages, that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nWait, but actually, from 1-400, there are 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 times 10 is 40 for each digit in the tens place up to page 400. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles again.\n\nWait, let me think again. From 1-100, the tens digit cycles 0-9 each appearing 10 times. Similarly, from 101-200, the tens digit is again 0-9 each appearing 10 times. Same for 201-300 and 301-400. So, up to page 400, each digit appears 4*10=40 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 481-488). So, let's see how many times each digit appears in the tens place in this range.\n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit is 0, so digit 0 appears 10 times, but we're interested in 4 and 8.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, let's list the ranges:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0\n- 411-420: tens digit 1\n- 421-430: tens digit 2\n- 431-440: tens digit 3\n- 441-450: tens digit 4\n- 451-460: tens digit 5\n- 461-470: tens digit 6\n- 471-480: tens digit 7\n- 481-488: tens digit 8\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 481-488 is 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for those 8 pages.\n\nSo, in the tens place from 401-488:\n\n- Digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times.\n- Digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place, from 401-488, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, total in the tens place:\n\n- Digit 4: up to 400, it's 40 times, plus 10 times from 401-488, so total 50 times.\n- Digit 8: up to 400, it's 40 times, plus 8 times from 401-488, so total 48 times.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check that. From 1-400, each digit appears 40 times in the tens place. Then, from 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, total for 4 in tens place: 40 +10=50, and for 8: 40 +8=48.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 48 times.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's zero. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, from 200-299 it's 2, and so on.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place, each digit from 1 to 4 appears in the hundreds place for 100 pages each. So:\n\n- 100-199: hundreds digit 1, 100 times\n- 200-299: hundreds digit 2, 100 times\n- 300-399: hundreds digit 3, 100 times\n- 400-488: hundreds digit 4, 89 times (since 488 is the last page)\n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 pages, right? Because 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, digit 4 appears 89 times, and digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, which is less than 800. So, digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all.\n\nSo, total counts:\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each position.\n\nFor digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89 = 188 times.\n\nFor digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 48 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\n\nTotal 8's: 49 +48 +0 = 97 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check these calculations.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 49 for both 4 and 8. Then, in the tens place, 50 for 4 and 48 for 8. In hundreds place, 89 for 4 and 0 for 8.\n\nSo, 4's total: 49 +50 +89 = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\n8's total: 49 +48 +0=97.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -97=91.\n\nWait, but let me check again, maybe I made a mistake in the units place.\n\nWait, earlier I thought that in the units place, each digit appears 48 times, and then in the remaining 8 pages, 481-488, digits 1-8 appear once each. So, for digit 4, that's 48 +1=49, and for 8, 48 +1=49. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, up to 400, each digit appears 40 times, and then from 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, 40+10=50 for 4, and 40+8=48 for 8. That seems correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 doesn't appear at all.\n\nSo, 4's total: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's total:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0=97.\n\nSo, 188 -97=91.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: total number of digits printed. Let's see, from 1-9: 9 numbers, 1 digit each: 9 digits.\n\nFrom 10-99: 90 numbers, 2 digits each: 180 digits.\n\nFrom 100-488: 389 numbers, 3 digits each: 1167 digits.\n\nTotal digits: 9 +180 +1167=1356 digits.\n\nNow, the total number of 4's and 8's is 188 +97=285. So, 285 digits, which is less than 1356, so that seems plausible.\n\nWait, but let me check if my counts for 4's and 8's are correct.\n\nWait, another approach: for each digit position, count how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nAs calculated, 49 times each.\n\nTens place:\n\n4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 48 times.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, 4's: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\n8's:49 +48 +0=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place in 401-488. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. For each tens digit, how many times does it appear?\n\n- 0: 401-410: 10 pages\n- 1:411-420:10\n- 2:421-430:10\n- 3:431-440:10\n- 4:441-450:10\n- 5:451-460:10\n- 6:461-470:10\n- 7:471-480:10\n- 8:481-488:8 pages\n\nWait, but that's 10 for each except the last one, which is 8. So, for the tens digit 4, it's 10 times, and for 8, it's 8 times.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the units place. Let me check again.\n\nTotal number of units digits from 1-488: 488 numbers, each with a units digit. So, each digit 0-9 appears floor(488/10)=48 times, and then the remainder is 8, so digits 1-8 appear once more.\n\nWait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so the last partial set is 481-488, which has units digits 1-8.\n\nSo, for units digit:\n\n- Each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times.\n- Then, in the last 8 pages, digits 1-8 each appear once more.\n\nSo, for digit 4: 48 +1=49.\n\nFor digit 8:48 +1=49.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because 488 is included, so 488's units digit is 8, so yes, 8 appears once more.\n\nSo, units place counts are correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 1-400, each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place.\n\nFrom 401-488, as I broke down earlier, 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, 40+10=50 for 4, and 40+8=48 for 8.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n\nSo, total counts as before.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 -97=91.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or something.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider each digit position separately and calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each.\n\nFor the units digit:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is given by:\n\ncount_units = (N // 10) * 1 + (1 if (N % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nWait, but that's for a specific d. Wait, actually, more accurately, for each digit d, the count in the units place is (N // 10) + (1 if (N % 10) >= d else 0), but only if d !=0, because for d=0, it's (N //10).\n\nWait, maybe I should use a more systematic approach.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in units place from 1 to 488:\n\nNumber of complete decades:488 //10=48, each contributing 1 occurrence of 4.\n\nThen, in the incomplete decade (481-488), check if 4 is <=8 (the last digit). Since 4 <=8, add 1.\n\nSo, total units for 4:48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8:\n\nComplete decades:48, each contributing 1 occurrence.\n\nIn the incomplete decade, 8 <=8, so add 1.\n\nTotal units for 8:48 +1=49.\n\nTens digit:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in tens place:\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 occurrences. So, up to 400, that's 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nTotal tens for 4:40 +10=50.\n\nFor 8 in tens place:\n\nUp to 400, 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40.\n\nFrom 401-488, tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 occurrences.\n\nTotal tens for 8:40 +8=48.\n\nHundreds digit:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in hundreds place:\n\nFrom 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 occurrences.\n\nNumber of times 8 appears in hundreds place:0, since the book doesn't go beyond 488.\n\nSo, total hundreds for 4:89.\n\nTotal hundreds for 8:0.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=97.\n\nDifference:188 -97=91.\n\nWait, so that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not overcounting or undercounting.\n\nWait, for example, in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, for each tens digit, how many times does it appear?\n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 times.\n\n411-420:1, 10 times.\n\n421-430:2, 10 times.\n\n431-440:3, 10 times.\n\n441-450:4, 10 times.\n\n451-460:5,10 times.\n\n461-470:6,10 times.\n\n471-480:7,10 times.\n\n481-488:8,8 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 8 times. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times, plus the last 8 digits from 481-488 add 1 to digits 1-8.\n\nSo, 4 and 8 each get an extra count.\n\nSo, yes, units place counts are correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, only 4 appears 89 times, as from 400-488.\n\nSo, yes, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, the total counts are 188 for 4 and 97 for 8, so the difference is 91.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me check the total number of digits printed.\n\nFrom 1-9:9 numbers, 1 digit each:9 digits.\n\nFrom 10-99:90 numbers, 2 digits each:180 digits.\n\nFrom 100-488:389 numbers, 3 digits each:1167 digits.\n\nTotal digits:9+180+1167=1356 digits.\n\nNow, total number of 4's and 8's:188 +97=285.\n\nSo, 285 digits are either 4 or 8. That seems reasonable because 285 is less than 1356.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about how many times each digit appears on average.\n\nBut I think the previous calculations are correct.\n\nSo, the answer is that there are 91 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

In the units place, the digits cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So for each set of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times a specific digit appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in the total number of pages, plus any extra if the total isn't a multiple of 10.\n\nWait, but in this case, the total number of pages is 488, which is a three-digit number. So I need to consider how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488. Let me calculate that. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and an additional 8 numbers. So for the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times, and then the digits from 0 to 8 appear one more time in the remaining 8 numbers. Therefore, the digit 4 appears 48 times in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears 48 times. Additionally, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears one more time. So for the units place, 4 appears 48 times and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The remaining 8 numbers after 480 would be 481 to 488. So the units digits in these numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So 8 appears once more in the units place, making the total for 8 in units place 48 + 1 = 49. But 4 appears once in the units place in 484, so 48 times plus once in 484, so 49 times as well? Wait, no, 484 is the 4th number after 480, so 481, 482, 483, 484, etc. So in the remaining 8 numbers, the units digits go up to 8, so 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So in the units place, 4 appears 48 times (from 1 to 480) plus 1 time in 484, totaling 49 times. Similarly, 8 appears 48 times plus 1 time in 488, so 49 times. So both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place. Hmm, maybe I was overcomplicating it earlier, but I think this is correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers, with each digit from 0 to 9 appearing 10 times in each cycle. So for example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. Each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred.\n\nSo, in 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred from 401-488. \n\nIn each complete hundred, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So for 4 complete hundreds, each digit appears 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Specifically, from 401-409, the tens digit is 0; 410-419, it's 1; and so on up to 480-488, where the tens digit is 8. So how many times does each digit appear in the tens place in this partial hundred?\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times, except for 8, which appears 9 times because the numbers go up to 488, which is 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481,...,488), so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times. Wait, no, actually, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-409) to 8 (480-488). So for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear?\n\nFrom 401-409: tens digit 0, which is 9 numbers (401-409), but wait, 401-409 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 0, so that's 9 times. But wait, in reality, 401 is the first number, so 401 has tens digit 0, 402 has 0, up to 409, which is 9 numbers. Then 410-419: tens digit 1, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, 420-429: tens digit 2, 10 numbers. Continuing up to 470-479: tens digit 7, 10 numbers. Then 480-488: tens digit 8, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So in the partial hundred, 0 appears 9 times, 1-7 each appear 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, for the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but the counts are as follows:\n\n- Tens digit 0: 401-409: 9 numbers\n- Tens digit 1: 410-419: 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 2: 420-429: 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 3: 430-439: 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 4: 440-449: 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 5: 450-459: 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 6: 460-469: 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 7: 470-479: 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 8: 480-488: 9 numbers\n\nSo in the partial hundred, the tens digits 0 and 8 each appear 9 times, while digits 1-7 appear 10 times each.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place, for the partial hundred (401-488), the digit 4 appears 10 times (from 440-449), and the digit 8 appears 9 times (from 480-488).\n\nSo in the tens place overall:\n\n- Digit 4: 4 complete hundreds * 10 times each = 40 times, plus in the partial hundred, 10 times, so total 50 times.\n- Digit 8: 4 complete hundreds * 10 times each = 40 times, plus in the partial hundred, 9 times, so total 49 times.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, in the tens place, for each complete hundred, each digit appears 10 times. So for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4*10=40 times for each digit. Then in the partial hundred, as calculated, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times. So total for 4 in tens place is 40 + 10 = 50, and for 8, it's 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but in the partial hundred, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. Similarly, 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is a bit different because it only changes every 100 numbers. For pages 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0 (since they are two-digit numbers). From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\n- Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so 0 appears 99 times, but since we're only counting 4 and 8, this doesn't contribute to either.\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so 1 appears 100 times, again not relevant for 4 or 8.\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, same thing.\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3.\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, and this is where 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers, meaning 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each place.\n\nFor 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times\n\nFor 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal for 8: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times\n\nSo the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So 48 * 1 = 48 for each. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8. So 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So total units: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each complete hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So 4 hundreds * 10 = 40 for each digit. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So total for 4: 40 + 10 = 50, and for 8: 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so 0. Correct.\n\nAdding them up:\n\n4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. Let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, which is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: for the hundreds digit, each hundred block contributes 100 numbers, but in the last partial block, it's only 88 numbers (400-488). Wait, no, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89, so yes, 89 numbers with hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, I think the calculation is correct. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place for the first 480 pages.\n   - Pages 481-488 add one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488).\n   - Total: 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times per hundred, totaling 40 times for 4 and 8 in the first 400 pages.\n   - Pages 401-488 add 10 more 4's (440-449) and 9 more 8's (480-488).\n   - Total: 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, 488 is a three-digit number, so I guess I need to consider all possibilities up to three digits.\n\nLet me start by considering how many times each digit appears in each position: units, tens, and hundreds. I remember that for counting digits in numbers, we can break down the problem by each digit place separately. So, I should calculate the number of 4's and 8's in the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place separately, and then add them up.\n\nFirst, let me handle the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 numbers. For example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit appears once in the units place every 10 numbers. Now, since the book has 488 pages, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 more numbers.\n\nIn each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 times 1, which is 48, plus any additional in the last partial block. Wait, the last partial block is from 481 to 488, so the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial block, does a 4 appear? Yes, at 484, and an 8 at 488. So, that's one more 4 and one more 8. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each block of 100. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, same with 8.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 100 do we have in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial block from 401-488.\n\nIn each complete block of 100, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, same with 8. So, for 4 blocks, that's 4 times 10 = 40 for each digit. Now, in the partial block from 401-488, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nLooking at 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page. Wait, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the partial block.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, when we're considering 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 480-488). So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, it's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. For the digit 8, it's from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place, the total number of 4's is 4 (complete blocks) * 10 = 40 plus 10 from the partial block, totaling 50. For 8's, it's 4 * 10 = 40 plus 9 from the partial block, totaling 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times. The difference here is 50 - 49 = 1.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. Each digit in the hundreds place appears 100 times for each digit. For example, from 1-99, there's no hundreds digit. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, appearing 100 times. Similarly, 200-299 has 2 appearing 100 times, and so on.\n\nIn our case, the book goes up to 488, so the hundreds digits we have are 1, 2, 3, and 4. Let's see how many times each digit appears in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, appearing 100 times.\nFrom 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, appearing 100 times.\nFrom 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, appearing 100 times.\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages.\n\nWait, let me check that. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nNow, we're looking for how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, as we just saw. The digit 8, however, doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. The next hundred would be 500-599, which isn't included. So, the hundreds digit 8 never appears. Therefore, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times, and 8's appear 0 times. The difference here is 89 - 0 = 89.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each digit place:\n\n- Units place: 0 difference\n- Tens place: +1 difference (more 4's)\n- Hundreds place: +89 difference (more 4's)\n\nTotal difference = 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each calculation to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nTotal units digits: 488 numbers. Each digit 0-9 appears floor(488/10) = 48 times, and then the remainder is 8. So, for digits 0-9, each appears 48 times, and then for the last 8 numbers (481-488), digits 1-8 appear once each. So, 4 appears once more, and 8 appears once more. So, total units 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, same for 8's: 48 +1 =49. So, units place difference is 0. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach block of 100 has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 blocks give 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, the last partial block from 401-488: the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, for 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 +10=50 for 4's, and 40 +9=49 for 8's. So, difference is +1. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 100-199: 100 times 1, 200-299: 100 times 2, 300-399: 100 times 3, 400-488: 89 times 4. So, 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times. So, difference is +89. That seems correct.\n\nAdding up: 0 +1 +89=90. So, 4's appear 90 more times than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I considered all the digits correctly. For example, in the hundreds place, does 488 count as having a hundreds digit? Yes, 488 is in the 400-488 range, so the hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times.\n\nAnother point to check: in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, correct. And 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the units place. Because when considering the last partial block, I added 1 for 4 and 1 for 8, but actually, the last partial block is from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers: 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, the units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I calculated the units place, I considered that each block of 10 has one 4 and one 8, so 48 blocks give 48 each, and then the last 8 numbers add 1 each. So, 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nSo, adding up, the total number of 4's is 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, no, I think I confused the counts here. Wait, no, actually, I think I should be adding the counts per digit, not the differences. Wait, no, I was calculating the differences per digit place, not the total counts. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the problem is to find how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, I can calculate the total number of 4's and the total number of 8's, then subtract.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the difference per digit place and sum them up, which is what I did earlier, getting a total difference of 90.\n\nBut let me try calculating the total counts to cross-verify.\n\nTotal number of 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49\n\nTens place: 50\n\nHundreds place:89\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89= 188\n\nTotal number of 8's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:49\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98\n\nDifference:188 -98=90\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, 4's appear 90 more times than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any digit places. For example, in the hundreds place, is 488 included? Yes, as the hundreds digit is 4, so it's counted in the 400-488 range, which is 89 times.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: from 1-488, how many times does each digit appear in each place.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for digit counting:\n\nFor units digit: total numbers /10 = 488/10=48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each, plus the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), which contribute one 4 and one 8, so total 49 each.\n\nFor tens digit: total numbers /100=4.88, so 4 full cycles, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's, so 40 each, plus the remaining 88 numbers (401-488). In these 88 numbers, the tens digit cycles 0-8, each digit appearing 10 times except for the last partial cycle.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to calculate how many times each digit appears in the tens place in the last partial hundred.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear?\n\nFrom 400-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410 (10 numbers), 1 for 411-420 (10), ..., up to 8 for 480-488 (9 numbers). So, for the tens digit 4, it appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the partial block, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times. So, total tens place: 4*10 +10=50 for 4's, and 4*10 +9=49 for 8's.\n\nSimilarly, in the hundreds place, from 1-488, the hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199 (100 times), 2 for 200-299 (100), 3 for 300-399 (100), and 4 for 400-488 (89). So, 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with hundreds digit 4. So, that's 89 times. And no 8's in the hundreds place, as the book doesn't go beyond 488.\n\nAnother point: when considering the tens place in the partial block, I have to make sure I'm not double-counting or missing any numbers. For example, in 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8, and each digit from 0-8 appears 10 times except for 8, which appears 9 times because we stop at 488.

    "text": " Wait, so page 1 is single-digit, pages 1-9, then pages 10-99 are two-digit, and pages 100-488 are three-digit numbers. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately.\n\nFirst, the units place. For the units digit, the 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, we take the integer part, which is 48. So that gives 48 times where the units digit is 4. But wait, does 488 include an extra 4 in the units place beyond those 48? Let me check: the last group is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the units digit 4 appears in 484, which is within that range. So actually, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, plus one more in 484, making it 49 times. Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, so the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So from 1 to 480, there are 480 pages, which is 48 groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, adding one more 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers long, so each contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? From 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But we're only interested in how many times the hundreds digit is 4, which is once for each number in that range. So 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Okay.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, plus the 8 in 488. So units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that range. So how many full tens ranges with 8 in the tens place? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo total in the tens place: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 4*10=40, plus the 480-488 range contributing 9. So 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. So 49 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Units: 49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So 49+49=98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So total 4's:188, total 8's:98. So 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nFirst, checking the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49. Let's see, from 1-488, every 10 pages, 4 appears once in the units place. So 488 /10=48.8, so 48 times, plus one more in 484, making 49. That seems correct.\n\n- Tens place: 5 ranges (40-49, 140-149, etc.) each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place:49. Same logic as 4's, 488/10=48.8, so 48 full groups, plus 488, making 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place:5 ranges, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place:0, since 800-899 is beyond 488. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems a large difference. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I overcounted the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times the hundreds digit is 4. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider each digit place separately for each page number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a formula approach.\n\nFor each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) =48, plus if the last digit is >=4, which it is (8), so 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's: floor(488/10)=48, plus if last digit >=8, which it is (8), so 48 +1=49.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100)*10 + min(max(488%100 -40 +1,0),10). Wait, perhaps a better way.\n\nThe tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So for each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49). So number of complete hundreds is 4 (0-399), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total 40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place: each hundred contributes 10 numbers where tens digit is 8 (80-89). So 4 complete hundreds: 4*10=40. In the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So total 40+9=49.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nNumber of 8's: from 800-899, but since 488 <800, 0 times.\n\nSo total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89)=188.\n\nTotal 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try a different approach.\n\nAnother way is to iterate through each page number and count the digits, but that's time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe using a formula for digit counting.\n\nIn general, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is:\n\nunits = (N // 10) + (1 if N % 10 >= d else 0)\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\n\ntens = (N // 100) * 10 + min(max(N % 100 - d*10 +1,0),10)\n\nAnd for hundreds place:\n\nhundreds = (N // 1000) * 100 + min(max(N % 1000 - d*100 +1,0),100)\n\nWait, perhaps that's overcomplicating, but let's try.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits place: N=488, d=4.\n\nunits = 488//10=48, plus 1 because 488%10=8 >=4, so 49.\n\nTens place: N=488, d=4.\n\ntens = (488 // 100) *10 + min(max(488%100 -4*10 +1,0),10)\n\n488//100=4, so 4*10=40.\n\n488%100=88, so 88 -40=48, so min(max(48,0),10)=10.\n\nSo tens=40+10=50.\n\nHundreds place: N=488, d=4.\n\nhundreds = (488//1000)*100 + min(max(488%1000 -4*100 +1,0),100)\n\n488//1000=0, so 0.\n\n488%1000=488, so 488 -400 +1=89.\n\nmin(89,100)=89.\n\nSo hundreds=89.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place: N=488, d=8.\n\nunits=488//10=48, plus 1 because 488%10=8 >=8, so 49.\n\nTens place: N=488, d=8.\n\ntens=(488//100)*10 + min(max(488%100 -80 +1,0),10)\n\n488//100=4, so 4*10=40.\n\n488%100=88, so 88 -80 +1=9.\n\nmin(9,10)=9.\n\nSo tens=40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: N=488, d=8.\n\nhundreds=(488//1000)*100 + min(max(488%1000 -800 +1,0),100)\n\n488//1000=0, so 0.\n\n488%1000=488, so 488 -800 +1= -311, which is less than 0, so max(-311,0)=0.\n\nSo hundreds=0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that confirms it again. So the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit '4':**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, '4' appears once in the units place.\n   - Total groups of 10: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n   - Additionally, '484' is within the range, adding one more.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - '4' appears in the tens place in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total: 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - '4' appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit '8':**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, '8' appears once in the units place.\n   - Total groups of 10: 48.\n   - Additionally, '488' is within the range, adding one more.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - '8' appears in the tens place in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9.\n   - Total: (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have '8' in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I should probably consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me start by considering how often each digit appears in each place. For the units place, every 10 pages, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once. So, for example, from page 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, the digit 4 appears once in the units place every 10 pages, and the same goes for 8. Now, how many times does this happen from 1 to 488?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 pages and then 8 extra pages. In each complete group, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for the units place, 4 appears 48 times and 8 also appears 48 times. But wait, we have 8 extra pages beyond 480. Pages 481 to 488. Let me check the units digits here: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in these 8 pages, 4 appears once (page 484) and 8 appears once (page 488). So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, in the units place, they are equal. Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 pages. So, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds do we have? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, each hundred contributes 10 occurrences, and same for 8. So, 4 hundreds would contribute 4 * 10 = 40 times for 4 and 40 times for 8 in the tens place. Now, let's look at the remaining 88 pages (401-488). The tens digits here go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490), but since we're only going up to 488, the last group is 8 (481-488). So, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place in these 88 pages?\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. For each tens digit, there are 10 numbers except for the last one, which is 8 and only has 8 numbers (481-488). So, for the tens digit 4, that's from 441-450, which is 10 pages. So, 4 appears once in the tens place here. For 8, it's from 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 appears once in the tens place here.\n\nSo, in the remaining 88 pages, 4 appears once in the tens place and 8 appears once. Therefore, in the tens place, 4 appears 40 + 1 = 41 times, and 8 appears 40 + 1 = 41 times. Hmm, again, they are equal. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought 4 might appear more, but maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me double-check. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does each digit appear? Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which is 8 and only appears 8 times because we stop at 488. So, for the tens digit 4, it's 10 times (441-450). For 8, it's 8 times (481-488). So, in the remaining 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 8 times. Therefore, in the tens place, 4 appears 4*10 + 10 = 50 times, and 8 appears 4*10 + 8 = 48 times. Wait, that makes more sense.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Let me clarify. Each complete hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.) contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So, for 4 hundreds, each digit appears 4*10 = 40 times. Now, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for the tens digit 4, it's 10 times (441-450), and for 8, it's 8 times (481-488). So, adding that to the previous 40, 4 appears 40 + 10 = 50 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 40 + 8 = 48 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 48 times. So, 4 is ahead by 2 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only present from page 100 onwards. So, for pages 1-99, there is no hundreds digit. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. How about 8? The hundreds digit never reaches 8 because the book only has 488 pages. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let me sum up the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each place.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 48 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal for 8: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97 times.\n\nWait, that seems off because earlier in the tens place, I thought 4 was ahead by 2, but when adding up, 4 is way ahead. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 49 for both 4 and 8. In the tens place, 50 for 4 and 48 for 8. In the hundreds place, 89 for 4 and 0 for 8. So, adding up:\n\n4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n8: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but that seems like a big difference. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those pages, which is correct. So, 89 times.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4, I think I miscalculated earlier. Let me go back.\n\nIn the tens place, from 1-400, we have 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times for each digit in the tens place, so 4*10=40 for 4 and 40 for 8. Then, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for the tens digit 4, it's 10 times (441-450). For 8, it's 8 times (481-488). So, in the incomplete hundred, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times. So, total in tens place: 40 +10=50 for 4, and 40 +8=48 for 8. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place: Each digit from 0-9 appears equally. From 1-488, there are 488 numbers. Each digit appears 48 times in the units place for each digit 0-9, except for the last partial set. Wait, actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so each digit 0-9 appears 48 times, and then in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8. So, digits 1-8 each get an extra count. So, for digits 1-8, they appear 48 +1=49 times. For 9 and 0, they appear 48 times because the remaining pages don't include them. So, 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times in the units place.\n\nSo, units place: 49 each.\n\nTens place: 50 for 4, 48 for 8.\n\nHundreds place: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 +50 +89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49 +48 +0=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if I'm counting correctly because sometimes when you have numbers like 400, 401, etc., the hundreds digit is 4, but the tens and units digits can also be 4 or 8. But I think I'm counting each digit separately, so that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should count how many times each digit appears in each position without overlap. For example, in 444, the hundreds, tens, and units digits are all 4, so each occurrence is counted separately. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. So, the difference is 188 -97=91.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in each position?\n\nUnits place: As calculated, 49 times.\n\nTens place: 50 times.\n\nHundreds place:89 times.\n\nTotal:188.\n\nSimilarly, 8's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:48\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTotal:97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nSo, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total pages: 488.\n   - Complete groups of 10: 48 groups (480 pages).\n   - Each digit appears 48 times in the units place.\n   - Remaining pages (481-488): units digits are 1-8, so '4' and '8' each appear once.\n   - Total '4's in units: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total '8's in units: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Complete hundreds: 4 (1-400).\n   - Each digit appears 40 times in the tens place.\n   - Remaining pages (401-488):\n     - Tens digits cycle 0-8.\n     - '4' appears in 441-450 (10 times).\n     - '8' appears in 481-488 (8 times).\n   - Total '4's in tens: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total '8's in tens: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 1-99: No hundreds digit.\n   - Pages 100-399: Hundreds digits 1, 2, 3 (no '4's or '8's).\n   - Pages 400-488: Hundreds digit is '4' for 89 pages.\n   - '4's: 89.\n   - '8's: 0.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - '8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n   - Difference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8, then subtract the totals to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I'll calculate how many 4's and 8's appear.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in every block of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 and one 8 in the units place. \n\nNow, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then a partial block of 8 numbers (481 to 488). In each full block, we have one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So for 48 blocks, that's 48 4's and 48 8's. \n\nNow, the partial block from 481 to 488. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So in this partial block, we have one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So adding that, the total for units place would be 48 + 1 = 49 4's and 48 + 1 = 49 8's. Wait, that seems like the same number. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. From 1 to 480, each 10 numbers contribute one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 480/10=48 blocks, giving 48 4's and 48 8's. Then from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. So total units place: 48 +1=49 4's and 48 +1=49 8's. So in units place, 4's and 8's are equal, 49 each. So the difference in units place is 0.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digits go from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, it appears 10 times in 40-49, 140-149, etc. Similarly for 8 in the tens place, it appears 10 times in 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is less than 500, so we have 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So that's five blocks. Let's calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place in each block.\n\nIn each 100-number block, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So in each block, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well. So for four full blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), that's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 4's and 40 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the last block is 400-488. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. The tens digit in this block is 0 for 400-409, 1 for 410-419, 2 for 420-429, 3 for 430-439, 4 for 440-449, 5 for 450-459, 6 for 460-469, 7 for 470-479, 8 for 480-488. Wait, but 488 is the end, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So in the tens place for 400-488, how many times does 4 appear? It's only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. For 8, it's in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So in the last block, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nSo total for tens place: 40 (from four full blocks) +10=50 for 4's, and 40 +9=49 for 8's. So in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times. So the difference here is 50 -49=1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for numbers 100 and above. The hundreds digit cycles every 1000 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), or 4 (400-488).\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times and 8 appears 0 times. The difference here is 89 -0=89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each place:\n\n- Units place: 49 4's vs 49 8's \u2192 difference 0\n- Tens place: 50 4's vs 49 8's \u2192 difference +1\n- Hundreds place: 89 4's vs 0 8's \u2192 difference +89\n\nTotal difference: 0 +1 +89=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 488 pages. Each 10 pages contribute one 4 and one 8 in the units place. 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full tens and a partial of 8 pages. Each full ten gives 1 each, so 48 each. The partial ten from 481-488: units digits 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. So total 49 each, so difference 0. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each 100 pages contribute 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. We have four full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), so 4\u00d710=40 each. Then in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449 (10 times) and 8 in 480-488 (9 times). So total 4's in tens place: 40+10=50, 8's:40+9=49. Difference +1. That seems right.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times. 8 never appears in hundreds place. So difference +89.\n\nAdding up: 0 +1 +89=90. So 4's are printed 90 times more than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, right? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So yes, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nAnd in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times 8 in the tens place, correct.\n\nSo yes, the total difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - 488 pages mean 48 full blocks (480 pages) and a partial block of 8 pages (481-488).\n   - Each full block gives 1 each, so 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - Partial block contributes 1 each, so total 49 4's and 49 8's.\n   - Difference: 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each 100 pages contribute 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - Four full blocks (0-399) give 40 each.\n   - The 400-488 block contributes 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 4's and 49 8's.\n   - Difference: +1.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 400-488 contributes 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Difference: +89.\n\nSumming the differences: 0 (units) +1 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Let me think about how many digits each page number has:\n\n- Pages 1 to 9: These are single-digit page numbers, so they only have one digit.\n- Pages 10 to 99: These are two-digit page numbers.\n- Pages 100 to 488: These are three-digit page numbers.\n\nI think I should handle each of these ranges separately because the number of times a digit appears can vary based on the number of digits in the page numbers.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers (1-9). In this range, the digits are just 1 through 9. So, how many 4's and 8's are there? Well, each digit from 1 to 9 appears exactly once in this range. So, there's one 4 and one 8. That means the count for both digits is 1 in the single-digit range.\n\nNext, moving on to two-digit page numbers (10-99). Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I think I should calculate the number of 4's and 8's in both the tens and units places separately.\n\nLet's start with the units place for two-digit numbers. The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each ten. So, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 9 times (since there are 9 sets of ten in the two-digit range: 10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99). Wait, actually, that's not quite right. Each digit from 0-9 appears 9 times in the units place for two-digit numbers because for each ten (like 10-19), the units digit cycles through 0-9, and there are 9 such tens (10-99). So, for each digit, it's 9 times in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, each digit from 1-9 appears 10 times. For example, in the 10-19 range, the tens digit is 1, and that happens 10 times. Same for 20-29 with tens digit 2, etc., up to 90-99 with tens digit 9.\n\nSo, for two-digit numbers:\n\n- Number of 4's in the units place: 9 (since 4 appears once in each ten's units place, and there are 9 tens).\n- Number of 4's in the tens place: 10 (since 40-49 have 4 in the tens place, and there are 10 numbers there).\n- Similarly, number of 8's in the units place: 9.\n- Number of 8's in the tens place: 10.\n\nWait, but hold on. When considering two-digit numbers, from 10 to 99, that's 90 numbers. So, the units digit for each digit 0-9 appears 9 times, and the tens digit for each digit 1-9 appears 10 times.\n\nSo, for 4's in two-digit numbers:\n\n- Units place: 9\n- Tens place: 10\n- Total 4's: 9 + 10 = 19\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 9\n- Tens place: 10\n- Total 8's: 9 + 10 = 19\n\nWait a minute, that seems like the same number of 4's and 8's in two-digit numbers. But that can't be right because when we get to three-digit numbers, maybe the counts differ. Let me check my math again.\n\nWait, no, actually, 4 appears as the tens digit in 40-49, which is 10 times, and as the units digit in each ten's place, so 9 times. So, 10 + 9 = 19. Similarly for 8's, it's the same. So, in two-digit numbers, both 4's and 8's appear 19 times each. So, the difference so far is zero between 4's and 8's in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. Let's break this down.\n\nEach three-digit number has a hundreds place, a tens place, and a units place. I think I need to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each of these places separately.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many three-digit page numbers there are. From 100 to 488, that's 488 - 100 + 1 = 389 numbers. Wait, no, 488 - 100 is 388, so adding 1 gives 389. But maybe I should handle each digit place separately.\n\nLet me consider the hundreds place first. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, hundreds digits are 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place:\n\n- When the hundreds digit is 1: 100-199. How many times does 4 appear? Zero times in the hundreds place.\n- When the hundreds digit is 2: 200-299. Similarly, 4 doesn't appear in the hundreds place.\n- When the hundreds digit is 3: 300-399. Again, 4 doesn't appear in the hundreds place.\n- When the hundreds digit is 4: 400-488. Here, 4 appears in the hundreds place for each number from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, how about 8's in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place in three-digit numbers up to 488. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place in three-digit numbers.\n\nFor the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears in each ten's group. Let me think about how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place across all three-digit numbers from 100 to 488.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds digit. For each hundreds digit (1, 2, 3, 4), the tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 numbers. But we have to consider that when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit only goes up to 8 because the book ends at 488. So, for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: the tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each hundred, so 10 times each. For hundreds digit 4: the tens digit goes from 0-8 because 488 is the last page. So, 9 times for each digit in the tens place when hundreds digit is 4.\n\nWait, let me clarify. For each hundreds digit, the number of tens groups is as follows:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 100-199. There are 10 tens groups (0-9 in tens place), each with 10 numbers. So, for each digit in the tens place, it appears 10 times.\n- Similarly, hundreds digits 2 and 3: same as above, each digit in the tens place appears 10 times per hundred.\n- Hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Here, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digit cycles through 0-8, which is 9 groups, each with 10 numbers except the last one if it's cut short. Wait, no, 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is 8 full tens groups (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488). Wait, no, 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is 8 full tens (each 10 numbers) plus 9 more numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 400-409 is 10 numbers, 410-419 is another 10, ..., up to 480-489, but since we stop at 488, the last group is 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nWait, but for the tens digit, in 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear?\n\n- Tens digit 0: 400-409: 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 1: 410-419: 10 numbers\n- ...\n- Tens digit 7: 470-479: 10 numbers\n- Tens digit 8: 480-488: 9 numbers\n\nSo, for hundreds digit 4, the tens digits 0-7 each appear 10 times, and tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nNow, for each digit in the tens place across all three-digit numbers:\n\n- For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n- For hundreds digit 4: digits 0-7 appear 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, let's calculate the number of 4's and 8's in the tens place.\n\nFirst, 4's in the tens place:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: each has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 3 * 10 = 30.\n- Hundreds digit 4: tens digit 4 appears in 440-449: 10 numbers.\n- Wait, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, right? So, that's another 10 times.\nWait, but earlier I thought that for hundreds digit 4, tens digits 0-7 appear 10 times each, but 4 is within 0-8, so it should also appear 10 times. Wait, no, because 4 is less than 8, so yes, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that for hundreds digit 4, the tens digits go up to 8, so 4 would be included. So, in the tens place, for hundreds digit 4, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449). So, total 4's in the tens place:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1,2,3: 3 * 10 = 30\n- Hundreds digit 4: 10\n- Total 4's in tens place: 30 + 10 = 40\n\nSimilarly, 8's in the tens place:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1,2,3: each has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 3 * 10 = 30.\n- Hundreds digit 4: tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n- So, total 8's in tens place: 30 + 9 = 39\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 4's in tens place: 40, 8's: 39.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers.\n\nIn the units place, each digit from 0-9 appears equally in each position, except possibly for the last group if it's cut short.\n\nLet's consider each hundreds digit:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 100-199. For each tens group (like 100-109, 110-119, etc.), the units digit cycles through 0-9. There are 10 tens groups, each contributing 1 occurrence of each digit in the units place. So, for each digit, it appears 10 times in the units place for hundreds digit 1.\n- Similarly, hundreds digits 2 and 3: same as above. Each digit appears 10 times in the units place for each hundred.\n- Hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Here, the units digit cycles through 0-9 for each tens group, but the last tens group is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, for the units digit, in the last tens group (tens digit 8), the units digits go from 0-8, so digits 0-8 appear once each, and 9 doesn't appear.\n\nSo, for hundreds digit 4, the units digit for each digit 0-9 appears as follows:\n\n- For tens digits 0-7: each units digit 0-9 appears once per tens group, so 10 times each (since there are 8 tens groups: 400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479). Wait, no, 400-488 includes tens digits 0-8, but the last tens group (480-488) only has 9 numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to calculate how many times each digit appears in the units place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nEach tens group from 400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479 has 10 numbers, so each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place for each of these 8 tens groups. So, that's 8 times each for digits 0-9.\n\nThen, in the last tens group, 480-488, the units digits go from 0-8, so each digit 0-8 appears once, and 9 doesn't appear.\n\nSo, for digits 0-8: 8 (from the full tens groups) + 1 (from the last partial group) = 9 times each.\nFor digit 9: only 8 times, since it doesn't appear in the last partial group.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because in the full tens groups (400-479), each digit 0-9 appears 8 times in the units place (since there are 8 tens groups). Then, in 480-488, digits 0-8 appear once each, and 9 doesn't. So, total for each digit:\n\n- Digits 0-8: 8 (from full groups) + 1 (from partial group) = 9\n- Digit 9: 8 (from full groups) + 0 (from partial group) = 8\n\nWait, but that would mean that digits 0-8 appear 9 times each, and 9 appears 8 times in the units place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right because in each full tens group (like 400-409), each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place, so 8 full tens groups would give 8 times each. Then, in the last partial group (480-488), digits 0-8 appear once each, so adding 1 to each of those, making it 9 times. Digit 9 doesn't appear in the last group, so remains at 8.\n\nSo, for units place in hundreds digit 4:\n\n- Digits 0-8: 9 times each\n- Digit 9: 8 times\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of 4's and 8's in the units place across all three-digit numbers.\n\nFirst, for hundreds digits 1,2,3:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the units place per hundred. So, for 3 hundreds digits, that's 3 * 10 = 30 times each for digits 0-9.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4:\n\n- Digits 0-8: 9 times each\n- Digit 9: 8 times\n\nSo, total units place counts:\n\n- For digit 4: 30 (from hundreds 1-3) + 9 (from hundreds 4) = 39\n- For digit 8: 30 (from hundreds 1-3) + 9 (from hundreds 4) = 39\n\nWait, that seems odd. Let me check again.\n\nWait, for hundreds digits 1-3, each digit in the units place appears 10 times per hundred, so 3 * 10 = 30 times for each digit.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4, digit 4 appears 9 times in the units place, and digit 8 appears 9 times as well. So, total for units place:\n\n- Digit 4: 30 + 9 = 39\n- Digit 8: 30 + 9 = 39\n\nWait, that's correct. So, both 4 and 8 appear 39 times in the units place across all three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in three-digit numbers.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 times (from 400-488)\n- Tens place: 40 times\n- Units place: 39 times\n- Total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0 times (since hundreds digits are 1-4)\n- Tens place: 39 times\n- Units place: 39 times\n- Total 8's in three-digit numbers: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check the tens and units place counts again.\n\nEarlier, for the tens place in three-digit numbers, I calculated:\n\n- 4's in tens place: 40\n- 8's in tens place: 39\n\nAnd for the units place:\n\n- 4's: 39\n- 8's: 39\n\nSo, adding hundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\n- 8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the counts across single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nFirst, single-digit (1-9):\n\n- 4's: 1\n- 8's: 1\n\nTwo-digit (10-99):\n\n- 4's: 19\n- 8's: 19\n\nThree-digit (100-488):\n\n- 4's: 168\n- 8's: 78\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nWait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 = 90, but I think I might have made a mistake in the three-digit counts. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, the hundreds place for 4's is 89, which seems correct because from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place for 4's: I had 40, which came from 3 hundreds (1,2,3) each contributing 10 times (3*10=30) plus 10 times in hundreds digit 4 (440-449), so 30+10=40. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 30 from hundreds 1-3, plus 9 from hundreds 4, totaling 39. That seems correct.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 for 4's in three-digit numbers.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nTens place: 39 (30 from hundreds 1-3, and 9 from hundreds 4's tens digit 8 in 480-488).\n\nUnits place: 39 (30 from hundreds 1-3, and 9 from hundreds 4's units digit 8 in 480-488).\n\nSo, 39 + 39 = 78. That seems correct.\n\nNow, adding single and two-digit numbers:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 each.\n\nTwo-digit: 19 each.\n\nThree-digit: 168 for 4's, 78 for 8's.\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's would have more, but 90 seems a bit high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in three-digit numbers, 4's in the hundreds place are 89, which is a significant contribution. 8's in three-digit numbers don't have any in the hundreds place, so they only get their counts from tens and units places, which are 39 each, totaling 78.\n\nSo, 168 (4's in three-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 1 (single-digit) = 188\n\nAnd 78 (8's in three-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 1 (single-digit) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me think about how to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately.\n\nAlright, let's start by considering each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each place one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every block of 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same for 8. For example, in pages 1-10, the 4 is in page 4 and the 8 is in page 8. So, every 10 pages, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10, and then an extra 8 pages (since 48*10=480, and 488-480=8). So, in the units place, each of the digits 4 and 8 will appear 48 times. But wait, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (page 484) and the digit 8 appears once (page 488). So, adding those, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's, 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, no difference there yet.\n\nMoving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for every 100 pages. For example, in pages 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for pages 1-9, 1 for 10-19, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, for each digit, it appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 pages.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial block from 401-488.\n\nIn each complete block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49 in each block), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89 in each block). So, for 4 blocks, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times each.\n\nNow, looking at the partial block from 401-488. The tens digit here goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, the digit 4 in the tens place would be in pages 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. The digit 8 in the tens place would be in pages 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is only 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 pages, but actually, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 pages. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the partial block. Wait, but let me double-check. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit, the number of times it appears is 10 except for the last one, which might be less if the total pages don't complete the block.\n\nWait, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for tens digit 0: 10 pages (401-410), 1: 10 (411-420), ..., up to 8: 9 pages (480-488). So, the digit 4 in the tens place is in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. The digit 8 in the tens place is in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, in the partial block, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total for the tens place: 4's = 4 blocks * 10 + 10 = 50, and 8's = 4 blocks * 10 + 9 = 49. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 = 90, but I think I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, I said 4 appears 89 times, which is correct because from 400 to 488 is 89 pages. But for 8's, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 0 times. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me recount the tens place for 8's. In the partial block (401-488), the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, in the tens place, 8's are 4 blocks * 10 (40) + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each, correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the hundreds digit for 4's would be 89, but maybe I should check that again. From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages, so yes, 89 times.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. In the partial block (401-488), the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. So, in the tens place, 4's are 4 blocks * 10 + 10 = 50, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, it's 4 blocks * 10 + 9 = 49, correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 pages, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48 times, and then in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once more. So, 48 + 1 = 49, correct.\n\nSame for 8's in the units place: 48 full cycles, 48 times, plus once in the remaining 8 pages, so 49.\n\nSo, the total 4's are 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because when I thought about the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 pages, but maybe I should include 480 as well, which is 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 times, which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as 480-489 would be 10 pages, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 9 pages. So, yes, 9 times.\n\nSo, the difference is 90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because I thought maybe the hundreds digit for 4's would be 89, but maybe I should check that again.\n\nWait, from page 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct, and the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think about how to count the number of times the digits 4 and 8 appear in each position: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place, I know that each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in the units place as we go through the numbers. For example, in every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), each digit appears once in the units place. So, for the entire book, how many blocks of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times, and then in the remaining 8 numbers, the digits 1-8 appear once each, and 9 doesn't appear because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, actually, 488 is the last page, so the units digits in the last partial block would be 1-8, right? So, for the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times, and then once more in 484, making it 49 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 48 times in the units place and then once more in 488, so that's 49 times as well. Wait, no, 488 is the last page, so the units digits go up to 8. So, in the last partial block, the units digits are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, both 4 and 8 appear once more in the units place. So, units place: 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for 488 pages, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). Wait, no, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages, but actually, 400-488 is 89 pages, but wait, 400 is included, so 400-488 is 89 pages. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. For the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each hundred. So, for 400 pages, each digit appears 4 times 10 = 40 times in the tens place. Then, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles again. From 401-410, tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; and so on up to 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit in 481-488 is 8. So, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place in the remaining 88 pages? Let's see: from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but we stop at 488). Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which appears only 8 times (since 481-488 is 8 numbers). Wait, no, from 401-488, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which is 8 and appears only 8 times because 481-488 is 8 numbers. Wait, that might not be accurate. Let me think again.\n\nActually, from 401-488, the tens digits go like this:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 numbers)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 numbers)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10 numbers)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10 numbers)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 numbers)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10 numbers)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10 numbers)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10 numbers)\n- 481-490: tens digit 8 (but we only go up to 488, so it's 8 numbers: 481-488)\n\nSo, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in the remaining 88 pages. Therefore, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the 400s (441-450), and the digit 8 appears 10 times in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in the 400s and 0 times elsewhere except in the 400s. Wait, no, in the first 400 pages, each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place, right? Because each hundred has 10 times each digit, and 4 hundreds would be 40 times. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and the tens digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, total in the tens place: 4 appears 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50 times. 8 appears 40 (from 1-400) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48 times.\n\nWait, but wait, from 1-400, each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place. Then, from 401-488, as I listed before, the tens digits go up to 8, with 8 appearing 8 times. So, for 4, in the 400s, 441-450 is 10 numbers, so tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, total for 4 in tens place is 40 + 10 = 50. For 8, in the 400s, 481-490 would be tens digit 8, but we only go up to 488, so that's 8 numbers. So, 8 in the tens place is 40 (from 1-400) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place? For 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0. For 100-199, hundreds digit is 1, appearing 100 times. Similarly, 200-299: 100 times 2, and 300-399: 100 times 3. Then, 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, and there are 89 pages (400-488 inclusive). So, digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, for 8 in the hundreds place, does it appear anywhere? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. The hundreds digit is only 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this book. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, total for hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nStarting with 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nNow for 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 48 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check these calculations because I might have made a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place for the first 480 pages (48*10). Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so each of these digits appears once more. So, for 4 and 8, they each get an additional 1, making it 48 + 1 = 49 in the units place. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 1-400, each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place. Then, from 401-488, the tens digits go as I listed before. For 4 in the tens place, it's 10 times (441-450). For 8, it's 8 times (481-488). So, 4's total tens count is 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's is 40 + 8 = 48. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 appears 0 times. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when counting in the tens and hundreds places, I might have overlapped or missed something.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) = 48 full cycles, each contributing 1 four, plus check the remainder. 488 mod 10 = 8, so the units digit goes up to 8, which includes 4, so add 1. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly for 8's: same calculation, 48 +1 = 49.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100) = 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, check the remaining 88 pages (400-488). In the tens place, how many fours? From 440-449, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 pages, so add 10. So total 40 +10=50.\n\nFor 8's in tens place: floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 pages (480-488), but wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 starting at 480? Wait, no, 480 has tens digit 8, right? Wait, 480 is 4-8-0, so tens digit is 8. So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, each with tens digit 8. So, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 8, but maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's clarify: from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490). But 480 is part of the 480-489 range, which would be the tens digit 8. So, in 401-488, how many times does the tens digit 8 appear? From 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, that's 9 times, not 8. So, earlier I thought it was 8, but actually it's 9. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49 times.\n\nWait, that changes things. So, let me correct that.\n\nSo, for tens place:\n\n4's: 40 +10=50\n\n8's: 40 +9=49\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place:49\n\nThen, in hundreds place:\n\n4's: 89 (400-488)\n\n8's: 0\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188\n\nTotal 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98\n\nSo, difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 91, but now it's 90. So, I must have made a mistake in the tens place count for 8's.\n\nWait, let me recount the tens place for 8's.\n\nFrom 1-400, each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place. So, 40 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nThen, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 times.\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place:40+9=49.\n\nSo, 8's total: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0: 49+49=98.\n\n4's total: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89: 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so the correct difference is 90.\n\nBut earlier I thought it was 91, but that was because I mistakenly counted 8's in the tens place as 8 instead of 9.\n\nWait, let me confirm: 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the remaining 88 pages.\n\nSo, 8's in tens place:40+9=49.\n\nSo, 8's total:49+49=98.\n\n4's total:49+50+89=188.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any other mistakes.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to consider each digit place separately and count the number of 4's and 8's in each.\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10)=48, plus if the last digit is >=4, add 1. Since 488 mod 10=8>=4, so 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly for 8's: floor(488/10)=48, and since 8>=8, add 1:48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100)=4, each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then, check the remaining 88 pages (400-488). In the tens place, how many fours? From 440-449, which is 10 pages, so add 10. Total 40+10=50.\n\nNumber of 8's: floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so add 9. Total 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/1000)=0, but since we have 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages (400-488 inclusive), so 89.\n\nNumber of 8's: 0, since the book doesn't reach 800 pages.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears equally in the units place.\n   - For 488 pages, there are 48 full cycles of 10, contributing 48 occurrences of each digit.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one more 4 and one more 8.\n   - **Total 4's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n   - **Total 8's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears 10 times in each hundred.\n   - For 400 pages, each digit appears 40 times in the tens place.\n   - In the remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n     - 4 appears 10 times (441-450).\n     - 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - **Total 4's in tens place:** 40 + 10 = 50\n   - **Total 8's in tens place:** 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89\n   - **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me think about how to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately, maybe in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10 numbers, there's one 4 and one 8. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). In each full block, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48, and the same for 8's. But wait, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in this partial block, there's one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488). So, adding those, the total number of 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49, and similarly for 8's, it's 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, 4's and 8's are equal, both 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), and so on up to 9 (90-99). So, in each block of 100 numbers, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 488 pages, how many full hundreds are there? There's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages left (401-488). So, in each of these four hundreds, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for 4's in the tens place, that's 4 * 10 = 40. For 8's, it's also 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nNow, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, I need to check if 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. Let's see: 401-410 has tens digit 0, 411-420 has 1, and so on until 480-488 has tens digit 8. So, in this partial block, does the tens digit equal 4? Yes, when the tens digit is 4, which would be 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So, that's 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Similarly, when the tens digit is 8, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, in the tens place for the last partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times. Therefore, adding this to the previous counts, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me make sure. So, in the full hundreds, 4's and 8's each had 40 in the tens place. Then, in the last partial hundred, 4's have 10 more, making it 50, and 8's have 9 more, making it 49. So, in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 49, so 4's are one more.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers from 100 to 488. So, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Each of these digits appears 100 times in the hundreds place for each hundred block. So, from 100-199, hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. How about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, the count for 4's in the hundreds place is 89, and 8's are 0.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. For 8's, 49 + 49 is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the tens place, I had 4's at 50 and 8's at 49, so that's one more 4. In the hundreds place, 4's are 89 more than 8's, which is 89. So, total difference would be 89 + 1 = 90. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me go through each digit place again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- Each block of 10 has one 4 and one 8.\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each.\n- The last 8 numbers: 481-488, units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, one 4 and one 8.\n- So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4's and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8's. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each block of 100 has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n- 4 full hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40 for each.\n- Then, the last partial hundred (401-488) has tens digits from 0 to 8.\n- For 4's in tens place: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more 4's, making it 50.\n- For 8's in tens place: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page), so 9 more 8's, making it 49.\n- So, tens place: 50 for 4's and 49 for 8's. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so 89 times.\n- 800-899: not present, so 0 times.\n- So, hundreds place: 89 for 4's and 0 for 8's. Correct.\n\nAdding them up:\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, I think that's correct. There are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers has one 4 and one 8.\n   - 48 full blocks (480 pages) contribute 48 each.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) add one 4 and one 8.\n   - **Total:** 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers has 10 4's and 10 8's.\n   - 4 full hundreds (400 pages) contribute 40 each.\n   - The last partial hundred (401-488) adds 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - **Total:** 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Only pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 4's.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total:** 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\n**Summing Up:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think about how many digits each page number has and where the digits 4 and 8 appear.\n\nMaybe I should consider each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That way, I can calculate how many times each digit appears in each position and then sum them up for the total count of 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10 numbers, there's one 4 and one 8. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. Wait, but actually, when considering units digits, each page number from 1 to 488 will have a units digit, so the total number of units digits is 488. But for each position, the number of times a digit appears can be calculated by dividing the total number by the base (which is 10 for units place) and then considering the remainder.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to calculate how many times each digit appears in each position separately. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n can be calculated as:\n\nNumber of times = floor(n / 10) + (1 if d <= (n % 10) else 0)\n\nWait, no, actually, for each digit d, the count in the units place is:\n\ncount_units = (n // 10) + (1 if (d <= (n % 10)) else 0)\n\nBut wait, actually, that's for digits from 0 to 9, but since our page numbers start at 1, the first digit is 1, so maybe the formula is a bit different. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that for each position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times a digit appears can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor units place:\n\nThe number of times digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is:\n\ncount_units = (n // 10) + (1 if d != 0 else 0) * (d <= (n % 10))\n\nWait, maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, for each position, the count can be calculated as:\n\nFor units place:\n\nEach digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often, except possibly the last partial cycle. So, for units place, the number of times 4 appears is floor(488 / 10) + (1 if 4 <= (488 % 10) else 0). Similarly for 8.\n\nSo, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, for units place:\n\nCount of 4's = 48 + (1 if 4 <=8 else 0) = 48 +1=49\n\nSimilarly, count of 8's in units place = 48 + (1 if 8 <=8 else 0) =48 +1=49\n\nWait, but that can't be right because from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (each 10 numbers) and then 8 extra numbers. So, in each full cycle of 10, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, 48 cycles give 48 4's and 48 8's. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in this partial cycle, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So total units place: 48+1=49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nWait, but that would mean both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place. But that seems correct because in each full 10, they each appear once, and in the last 8, they each appear once.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each block of 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit cycles 0 (1-9), 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), ..., 9 (90-99). So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for each 100 numbers.\n\nSo, for 488 pages, how many full hundreds do we have? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each full hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49 in each hundred). Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89 in each hundred).\n\nSo, for 4 full hundreds, that's 4*10=40 times for 4's and 4*10=40 times for 8's.\n\nNow, the remaining 88 pages (401-488). Let's see how the tens digit behaves here.\n\nFrom 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles through 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-488).\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so from 481 to 488, the tens digit is 8, but the units digit goes up to 8.\n\nSo, in the tens place, for the 401-488 range, the digit 4 appears once in the tens place (441-450), which is 10 numbers. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once in the tens place (481-488), which is 8 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. Wait, but in the tens place, each occurrence is for a full 10 numbers, except possibly the last partial group.\n\nWait, but 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, but since it's only 8 numbers, does that count as 8 times for the tens digit 8? Or is it that each full 10 numbers contribute 10 counts, and partial groups contribute as per the number of numbers?\n\nWait, no, in the tens place, each digit appears for 10 consecutive numbers. So, for example, 481-490 would be 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 numbers. So, does that mean the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in 481-488? Or is it that the tens digit is 8 for those 8 numbers, so each of those 8 numbers contributes one count of 8 in the tens place. So, that's 8 counts for 8 in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, the digit 4 in the tens place occurs in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 counts.\n\nSo, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, total tens place counts:\n\nFor 4's: 40 (from the 4 full hundreds) +10 (from 401-488) =50\n\nFor 8's: 40 (from the 4 full hundreds) +8 (from 401-488) =48\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Each full hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 counts of 4 and 10 counts of 8 in the tens place. So, 4 full hundreds give 4*10=40 for each digit.\n\nIn the 401-488 range, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 counts. The tens digit 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 counts.\n\nSo, total for tens place:\n\n4's:40+10=50\n\n8's:40+8=48\n\nWait, but that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, each digit from 1 to 4 appears, since we have a 488-page book. So, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4, it appears from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (400-488 inclusive). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, hundreds digit 8 doesn't appear at all because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds digit 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place:\n\n4's:89\n\n8's:0\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in all positions.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:50\n\nHundreds place:89\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:48\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from total 4's:188-97=91\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n488 pages. For units digits, each digit 0-9 appears 48 full times (since 488//10=48), and then the remainder is 8. So, digits 1-8 appear once more in the units place, but wait, no, actually, the units digits go from 1 to 8 in the last partial block. So, digits 1-8 each appear once more, and 9 and 0 don't appear in the last partial block. Wait, but earlier I thought both 4 and 8 appeared once, but actually, 4 is <=8, so yes, both appear once. So, units place counts for 4 and 8 are both 48+1=49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nFull hundreds:4, each contributing 10 counts for 4 and 10 for 8, so 40 each.\n\nIn the 401-488 range, 4's tens digit occurs once (441-450, 10 numbers) and 8's occurs once (481-488, 8 numbers). So, 10 and 8 counts respectively. So, total 4's in tens place:40+10=50, 8's:40+8=48. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 counts.\n\n8's: none, since the book ends at 488, so hundreds digit 8 doesn't occur. So, 0 counts.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nWait, but let me check if I considered all page numbers correctly. Page 1 is page 1, so the first page is single-digit, but in my calculations, I included all page numbers from 1 to 488, so I think that's correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: let's compute the total number of digits printed. Each page number from 1 to 488 has:\n\n- Pages 1-9: 1 digit each, 9 pages, 9 digits.\n\n- Pages 10-99: 2 digits each, 90 pages, 180 digits.\n\n- Pages 100-488: 3 digits each, 389 pages, 1167 digits.\n\nTotal digits:9+180+1167=1356 digits.\n\nNow, total 4's:188, total 8's:97, so total 4's and 8's:188+97=285. The remaining digits would be other digits, which should sum up to 1356-285=1071.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps, but just as a sanity check.\n\nWait, another thought: in the hundreds place, from 1-399, the hundreds digit is 1,2,3, each appearing 100 times. Then from 400-488, hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times. So, hundreds digit counts:1:100, 2:100, 3:100, 4:89, others:0. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, for each hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10=40 for each digit, and then in the last partial hundred (401-488), as calculated.\n\nSo, I think my counts are correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188-97=91. So, there are 91 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the number of 8's. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately:\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times in the units place for the first 480 pages.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) add one more 4 and one more 8.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times per hundred, totaling 40 times for each digit in the first 400 pages.\n   - From 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91\n\nThus, there are 91 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " I should probably count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each place one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place**: The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers (like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 times. But wait, the last group goes up to 488, and 484 is the last number with a 4 in the units place before 488. So, yes, 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place**: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers (like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449). Let's see how many hundreds we have. From 1 to 488, there are four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. Wait, actually, 400-488 is the fifth hundred, but only up to 488. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers. So, how many times does this happen? From 40-49: 10 times, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 times. So 5*10 = 50 times. Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so the last hundred is 401-488, which includes 440-449. So yes, 5 sets. So 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding these up: Units (48) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, the digit 4 appears 187 times.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place**: Similar to 4, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers (like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 ends with an 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's the same as the number of complete tens. Since 488 is 48*10 + 8, so the number of times 8 appears in the units place is 49 times. Wait, because 8 appears in 8, 18, ..., 488, which is 49 numbers. Let me confirm: The first occurrence is at 8, which is the 8th number, and the last is 488, which is the 488th number. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place**: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers (like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-489). But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many full sets of 10 are there? From 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9. So that's 4 full sets and one partial set. So, 4*10 = 40, plus 9 = 49 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8 in the page numbers. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding these up: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8. From 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 times. So total is 4*10 + 9 = 49, which matches what I had earlier.\n\nSo, digit 4 appears 187 times, and digit 8 appears 98 times.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place of 4, we had 5 sets: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct.\n\nUnits place for 4: 48 times. Wait, but earlier I thought 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is included, so maybe it's 49? Wait, no, because 488 is the 488th page, and 488 has an 8 in the units place, not a 4. So, the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 484th page. So, from 4 to 484, that's 484/10 = 48.4, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4. So, 48 times. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I calculated units place for 8, I had 49 because 488 is included. So, for 4, it's 48, because 488 isn't a 4 in the units place. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, 4 appears 187 times, 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nI think that's the answer. Let me just go through once more to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, for the hundreds place of 4: 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct.\n\nTens place of 4: 5 sets of 10, so 50.\n\nUnits place of 4: 48.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nUnits place of 8: 49.\n\nTens place of 8: 49.\n\nHundreds place of 8: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place**: 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 48 such occurrences.\n2. **Tens place**: 4 appears in sequences like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place**: 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place**: 8 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences.\n2. **Tens place**: 8 appears in sequences like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place**: 8 does not appear in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference**: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should separate the counting into different parts based on the number of digits.\n\nLet me start by considering one-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digits 4 and 8 each appear once. So, for one-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear once. That means the count for 4 is 1, and for 8, it's also 1. So far, they're equal.\n\nNext, I'll move on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a ones place. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nStarting with the tens place: For the tens digit, 4 appears from 40 to 49, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears from 80 to 89, also 10 times. So in the tens place, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times each.\n\nNow, for the ones place in two-digit numbers: The digit 4 appears once in every ten numbers, like 14, 24, 34, etc., up to 94. That's 9 times in total. Wait, but from 10 to 99, how many 4's are there in the ones place? Let me think: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times. Similarly, for 8's in the ones place: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's also 9 times. So in the ones place, 4 and 8 each appear 9 times.\n\nAdding up the two places for two-digit numbers: For 4's, 10 (tens) + 9 (ones) = 19. For 8's, 10 (tens) + 9 (ones) = 19. So, in two-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear 19 times each. So far, in one and two-digit numbers, 4's and 8's are both at 1 + 19 = 20 each. So, they're equal up to page 99.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is where it might get a bit more complicated because the hundreds place can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, and the tens and ones places can vary. I think I should break this down further.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since we're only interested in how many times 4 and 8 appear, I should check each hundreds digit separately.\n\nStarting with hundreds digit 1 (pages 100-199): In this range, the hundreds digit is 1, so it doesn't affect the count for 4 or 8. So, I need to look at the tens and ones places.\n\nIn the tens place for pages 100-199: The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each hundred. So, for each ten, the digit 4 appears once in the tens place, specifically in 140-149, and 8 appears once in 180-189. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (from 140-149) and 8 appears 10 times (from 180-189). Wait, no, actually, each ten has 10 numbers, so for each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 140-149) and similarly for 8. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 10 times in each hundred. But since we're only considering 100-199, that's just once each. Wait, no, actually, in each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in 100-199, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (140-149) and 8 appears 10 times (180-189). So, for the tens place in 100-199, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\nNow, for the ones place in 100-199: The ones digit cycles from 0-9 for each ten. So, in each ten, 4 appears once in the ones place, and 8 appears once. Since there are 10 tens (00-99), each digit appears 10 times in the ones place. So, in 100-199, 4 appears 10 times in the ones place, and 8 appears 10 times as well.\n\nSo, in 100-199, the total count for 4's is 10 (tens) + 10 (ones) = 20. Similarly, 8's are 10 + 10 = 20.\n\nNext, hundreds digit 2 (pages 200-299): The same logic applies here. The hundreds digit is 2, so it doesn't affect the count. The tens place will have 4 appearing 10 times (240-249) and 8 appearing 10 times (280-289). The ones place will have 4 appearing 10 times and 8 appearing 10 times. So, 4's total is 20, and 8's total is 20.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds digit 3 (pages 300-399): The tens place for 4 is 340-349 (10 times), and for 8, it's 380-389 (10 times). The ones place will also have 10 each. So, 4's: 20, 8's: 20.\n\nNow, hundreds digit 4 (pages 400-488): Here, the hundreds digit is 4, so every page from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place here? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, let's check the tens and ones places.\n\nIn the tens place for 400-488: The tens digit can be 0-8, but since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, let's break it down:\n\n- For tens digit 0: pages 400-409. Here, 4 appears in the hundreds place, but we're considering the tens place. So, 4 doesn't appear in the tens place here. 8 appears in the ones place once (408), but that's in the ones place.\n\nWait, no, I'm considering the tens place for 4's and 8's. So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 times. Similarly, 8 in the tens place appears in 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is only 9 pages because 488 is the last one. So, 480-488 is 9 pages, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 400-488, the tens digit for 8 would be in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, in the ones place for 400-488: The ones digit cycles from 0-9 for each ten. So, in each ten, 4 appears once in the ones place, and 8 appears once. But since the last ten is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers, does that affect the count?\n\nWait, no, because for each hundred, the ones digit cycles through 0-9 ten times. So, in 400-499, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the ones place. But since we're only going up to 488, let's see:\n\nFrom 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the ones place? Let's see: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 times because 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, but 494 isn't. So, 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, 8 in the ones place: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 times as well.\n\nWait, but in 400-488, each ten from 400-409, 410-419, etc., up to 480-488. So, for the ones place, in each ten, 4 appears once and 8 appears once, except maybe the last ten, which is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 488 is included, so 8 appears once in the ones place there.\n\nWait, but actually, from 400 to 488, there are 9 complete tens (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488). Wait, no, 400-409 is the first ten, then 410-419, up to 480-488, which is the ninth ten. So, each ten has 10 numbers except the last one, which has 9. So, in the ones place, for each ten, 4 appears once, so in 8 complete tens, that's 8 times, and in the ninth ten, 480-488, 4 appears once (484). So total 8 + 1 = 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, 8 in the ones place appears once in each ten, so 8 times in the first 8 tens, and once in the ninth ten (488). So, 8 + 1 = 9 times.\n\nWait, but 400-409: 404 is 4 in ones place.\n\n410-419: 414.\n\n420-429: 424.\n\n430-439: 434.\n\n440-449: 444.\n\n450-459: 454.\n\n460-469: 464.\n\n470-479: 474.\n\n480-488: 484.\n\nSo that's 9 times for 4 in the ones place.\n\nSimilarly, 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488: 9 times for 8 in the ones place.\n\nSo, in the ones place, 4 appears 9 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nPutting it all together for the hundreds digit 4 (400-488):\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (from 400 to 488 inclusive).\n- Tens place: 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n- Ones place: 4 appears 9 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total for 4's in 400-488:\n\nHundreds: 89\n\nTens: 10\n\nOnes: 9\n\nTotal: 89 + 10 + 9 = 108\n\nTotal for 8's in 400-488:\n\nHundreds: 0 (since hundreds digit is 4, not 8)\n\nTens: 9\n\nOnes: 9\n\nTotal: 0 + 9 + 9 = 18\n\nWait, that seems off because in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, but 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all in 400-488. So, 8's only come from the tens and ones places, which are 9 each, totaling 18.\n\nNow, let me summarize all the counts:\n\nOne-digit numbers (1-9):\n\n4: 1\n\n8: 1\n\nTwo-digit numbers (10-99):\n\n4: 19\n\n8: 19\n\nThree-digit numbers:\n\n100-199: 4:20, 8:20\n\n200-299: 4:20, 8:20\n\n300-399: 4:20, 8:20\n\n400-488: 4:108, 8:18\n\nSo, adding up all 4's:\n\n1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 20 (100-199) + 20 (200-299) + 20 (300-399) + 108 (400-488) = 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 20 = 40; 40 + 20 = 60; 60 + 20 = 80; 80 + 108 = 188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\n1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 20 (100-199) + 20 (200-299) + 20 (300-399) + 18 (400-488) = 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 20 = 40; 40 + 20 = 60; 60 + 20 = 80; 80 + 18 = 98.\n\nWait, so 4's total is 188 and 8's total is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the counts because 90 seems a bit high.\n\nWait, let me recheck the counts for each range.\n\nOne-digit:\n\n4:1, 8:1\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n4:19, 8:19\n\n100-199:\n\n4:20, 8:20\n\n200-299:\n\n4:20, 8:20\n\n300-399:\n\n4:20, 8:20\n\n400-488:\n\n4:108, 8:18\n\nAdding up 4's: 1 + 19 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 108 = 188\n\nAdding up 8's: 1 + 19 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 18 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, but I'm a bit concerned about the 400-488 range. Let me verify the counts there again.\n\nIn the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times.\n\n8 appears in the tens place in 480-488, which is 9 times.\n\nIn the ones place, 4 appears 9 times, as we listed earlier, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, 4's in 400-488: 89 + 10 + 9 = 108\n\n8's in 400-488: 0 + 9 + 9 = 18\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nSo, adding all up, the total 4's are 188 and 8's are 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I was counting the ones place in 400-488, I considered 9 times for both 4 and 8. Is that accurate?\n\nFrom 400-488, the ones digit cycles through 0-9 for each ten, except the last ten, which is 480-488, which has 9 numbers. So, in each complete ten (e.g., 400-409), 4 appears once in the ones place, and 8 appears once. There are 8 complete tens before 480-488. So, 8 times each. Then, in 480-488, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total 9 each. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, 440-449 is 10 pages, so 4 appears 10 times. 480-488 is 9 pages, so 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, yes, the counts seem accurate.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's printed is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot. Let me see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position across all page numbers up to 488.\n\nLet's consider each digit position separately: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nFor units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nSimilarly for 8.\n\nIn the units place, each digit from 0-9 appears equally often, except possibly the last digit if the total number isn't a multiple of 10.\n\nSo, total numbers: 488\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: 48 (since 48*10=480), and then 8 more numbers (481-488).\n\nIn each group of 10, 4 appears once in the units place, and 8 appears once.\n\nSo, for 48 complete groups: 48*1 = 48 times for 4, and 48 times for 8.\n\nIn the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488).\n\nSo, total for units place:\n\n4: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n8: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nWait, but earlier I had 9 in the 400-488 range. Hmm, this approach is different. Let me see.\n\nWait, no, this is a different approach, considering all numbers from 1 to 488, not just the three-digit ones. So, perhaps this is a better way.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, there are 4 hundreds (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, actually, 488 is in the 400-488 range, which is part of the 400s.\n\nSo, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\nBut in the 400-488 range, the tens digit goes up to 8, but only up to 488, so the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the 400-488 range, but in the other hundreds, it's 10 times each.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to calculate the total number of times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place across all page numbers.\n\nTotal numbers: 488\n\nFor the tens place:\n\nEach hundred (0-99, 100-199, etc.) contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place.\n\nSo, for 1-99: 10 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n\nFor 100-199: same, 10 each.\n\nFor 200-299: same.\n\nFor 300-399: same.\n\nFor 400-488: the tens digit goes from 0-8, but only up to 488.\n\nSo, in 400-488, the tens digits go from 0-8, but the last group (80-88) only has 9 numbers (480-488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nSo, total for tens place:\n\n4: 10 (1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (440-449) = 50\n\n8: 10 (1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (480-488) = 49\n\nWait, but that seems different from my earlier approach. Let me check.\n\nWait, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\nFor 4's in tens place: 10 (1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (440-449) = 50\n\nFor 8's in tens place: 10 (1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (480-488) = 49\n\nSimilarly, for the hundreds place:\n\n4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 times.\n\n8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is only 1,2,3,4.\n\nSo, hundreds place:\n\n4: 89\n\n8: 0\n\nNow, let's sum up all the digit positions.\n\nUnits place:\n\n4: 49\n\n8: 49\n\nTens place:\n\n4: 50\n\n8: 49\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4: 89\n\n8: 0\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nSo, that matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nI think this makes sense now. So, the final answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **One-Digit Page Numbers (1-9):**\n   - Both '4' and '8' appear once.\n\n2. **Two-Digit Page Numbers (10-99):**\n   - **Tens Place:** Each digit (4 and 8) appears 10 times (e.g., 40-49 for '4', 80-89 for '8').\n   - **Units Place:** Each digit appears 9 times (e.g., 14, 24, ..., 94 for '4'; 18, 28, ..., 98 for '8').\n   - **Total for Two-Digit Numbers:** Both digits appear 19 times each.\n\n3. **Three-Digit Page Numbers (100-488):**\n   - **100-199, 200-299, 300-399:**\n     - **Tens and Units Places:** Each digit appears 20 times in each hundred.\n   - **400-488:**\n     - **Hundreds Place:** '4' appears 89 times.\n     - **Tens Place:** '4' appears 10 times (440-449), '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n     - **Units Place:** Both digits appear 9 times each.\n\n4. **Summing Up:**\n   - **Total '4's:** 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 20 (100-199) + 20 (200-299) + 20 (300-399) + 108 (400-488) = 188.\n   - **Total '8's:** 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 20 (100-199) + 20 (200-299) + 20 (300-399) + 18 (400-488) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me think about how many digits each page number has and where the digits 4 and 8 might appear.\n\nMaybe I should consider each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. That way, I can calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in each position and then sum them up. Okay, let's start with the units place.\n\nFor the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Wait, but page numbers start at 1, so the first block is 1-10, which actually has 10 numbers. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times from the full blocks and then once more in 484, making it 49 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 48 times from the full blocks and then once more in 488, so that's 49 times. Wait, but hold on, 488 is the last page, so the units digit in 488 is 8, so that's correct. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. Hmm, so the difference in the units place is zero.\n\nNow, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the digit in the tens place goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 times, and similarly, 8 appears in 80-89, which is also 10 times. So, for each 100 pages, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, how many full hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial hundred from 401-488. So, in each full hundred, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. So that's 4 times 10, which is 40 times each from the full hundreds.\n\nNow, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Let's see, in 401-488, the tens digits go through 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-488). Wait, but 488 is the end, so the tens digit in 481-488 is 8, but that's only 8 numbers, right? From 481 to 488, that's 8 numbers. So, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place in this partial block?\n\nFor 4 in the tens place: It's from 441-450, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 441-450 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in the partial block.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place: It's from 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 appears 8 times in the tens place here. Wait, but wait, 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for each of these, so that's 8 times. So, in the partial block, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, adding this to the full hundreds, 4 appears 40 + 10 = 50 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 40 + 8 = 48 times in the tens place. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 48 times, so the difference here is 2 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is a bit trickier because it's only present in three-digit numbers. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place.\n\nFor 4 in the hundreds place: It's from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nFor 8 in the hundreds place: Hmm, wait, does the hundreds digit ever reach 8? The book only has 488 pages, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each digit place.\n\nFrom the units place: 49 4's vs 49 8's \u2192 difference is 0.\n\nFrom the tens place: 50 4's vs 48 8's \u2192 difference is +2.\n\nFrom the hundreds place: 89 4's vs 0 8's \u2192 difference is +89.\n\nSo, total difference is 0 + 2 + 89 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because 91 seems a bit high, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place: Each block of 10 has one 4 and one 8. There are 48 full blocks (1-480), each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so that's 48 each. Then, from 481-488, we have 484, which adds one more 4, and 488, which adds one more 8. So, units place: 49 4's and 49 8's. That's correct.\n\nTens place: Each full hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.) contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 times 10 is 40 each. Now, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. For 4 in the tens place, it's 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more 4's. For 8 in the tens place, it's 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 more 8's. So, total in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 4's and 40 + 8 = 48 8's. So, difference of +2. That's correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So, 0 8's. So, difference of +89.\n\nAdding up: 0 (units) + 2 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 91. So, the total number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother thing to check: Did I count the units and tens digits correctly in the partial block? Let's see, in 401-488, for the units digit, we had 484 and 488, which are correct. For the tens digit, 441-450 adds 10 4's, and 481-488 adds 8 8's. So, that seems correct.\n\nI think my calculations are correct, so the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n1. **Units Place Analysis:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) has one '4' and one '8' in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full blocks (1-480), contributing 48 '4's and 48 '8's.\n   - The partial block (481-488) adds one '4' (484) and one '8' (488).\n   - Total: 49 '4's and 49 '8's in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens Place Analysis:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers has 10 '4's and 10 '8's in the tens place.\n   - Four full hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 '4's and 40 '8's.\n   - The partial block (401-488) adds 10 '4's (441-450) and 8 '8's (481-488).\n   - Total: 50 '4's and 48 '8's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place Analysis:**\n   - The hundreds digit is '4' for pages 400-488, contributing 89 '4's.\n   - '8' never appears in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n   - Total: 89 '4's and 0 '8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSumming up the differences:\n- Units place: 0 difference.\n- Tens place: +2 difference.\n- Hundreds place: +89 difference.\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 2 + 89 = 91.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Wait, actually, 488 is a three-digit number, so the page numbers range from 1 up to 488, meaning the first few pages are single-digit, then two-digit, and then three-digit.\n\nI think the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have the counts for both digits, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 and then an additional 8 numbers. In each full set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again in the units place here. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place in numbers from 40 to 49, 140 to 149, 240 to 249, etc. Each of these blocks is 10 numbers long. Let's see how many such blocks there are. The hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, or 3 because 488 is less than 500. So, for each hundred, there's a block where the tens digit is 4. So, for hundreds digit 0: 40-49 (10 numbers), hundreds digit 1: 140-149, hundreds digit 2: 240-249, and hundreds digit 3: 340-349. Each of these contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So that's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 times. Now, do we have any more blocks beyond that? The next would be 440-449, but since the book only goes up to 488, 440-449 is within that range. Wait, no, 440 is part of the hundreds digit 4, but in our case, the hundreds digit goes up to 3 because 488 is less than 500. Wait, no, 440 is still within 488. Hmm, I think I made a mistake here. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, 488 is the last page, so the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, but only up to 488. So, for the tens digit being 4, the blocks are:\n\n- 040-049 (but 040 is actually 40, so 40-49)\n- 140-149\n- 240-249\n- 340-349\n- 440-449\n\nEach of these is 10 numbers, so that's 5 blocks. Each contributes 10 occurrences, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, I think I initially missed that. So, the tens place has 50 occurrences of 4.\n\nWait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 in total. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: Each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's correct. So, 89 occurrences in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many full sets of 10 are there in 488? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks is 10 numbers, so that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 8's, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, is there a 480-489 block? Yes, but 480-488 is part of that. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, in the tens place, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. The blocks are:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 numbers\n\nSo, 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, so 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because when I calculated 4's, I got 187, and 8's as 98, which would mean 187 - 98 = 89 more 4's. But let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me go back to the 8's in the tens place. The 480-488 block: from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8, right? So, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 times the digit 8 in the tens place. So, 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 4\u00d710=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. That seems correct.\n\nNow, units place for 8's: from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Each 10 numbers, so 48 full sets (48\u00d710=480), contributing 48 8's. Then, the remaining 8 numbers are 481-488, where the units digit is 8 in 488, so that's one more. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier for 4's, I had 187. So, 187 - 98 = 89. So, 4's appear 89 times more than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the 4's count because I might have made a mistake there.\n\nFor 4's in the units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, so 48 full sets (48\u00d710=480) contributing 48 4's. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so no 4's there. So, 48 units place 4's.\n\nTens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, 50 tens place 4's.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 hundreds place 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nSo, 187 4's and 98 8's. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So, 4's are printed 89 times more than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I thought about the tens place for 4's, I considered 440-449, but in the 8's case, I considered 480-488, which is only 9 numbers. So, that's correct because 480-488 is part of the 8's in the tens place but not a full block of 10.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: For 4's in the tens place, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four are 10 each, and the last is 9, so 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. For 4's, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nFor 8's, the hundreds digit is 8 only in 800-899, which is beyond 488, so zero.\n\nSo, yes, 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 = 98.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 187, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I counted 4's in the hundreds place, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. But when I count 8's in the hundreds place, it's zero because 800 is beyond 488. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to check: Let me think about how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a formula or a more systematic approach.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is floor(N/10) + (1 if the units digit of N is >= d else 0).\n\nWait, but maybe that's complicating it. Alternatively, for each digit position, calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the standard method for counting digit occurrences.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) = 48, and since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so add 1? Wait, no, because we're counting how many times 4 appears in the units place. So, for units digit, it's floor(488/10) = 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, check if the remaining numbers (from 481 to 488) have a 4 in the units place. Since 481-488 are 8 numbers, and 484 is within that range, so that's one more 4. So, total 48 + 1 = 49? Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, I'm confused now.\n\nWait, no, earlier I thought that in the units place, 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, and then in the remaining 8 numbers, 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once more at 484. So, total 48 +1=49. But earlier, I thought it was 48. Wait, which is correct?\n\nWait, let me list some numbers:\n\n4,14,24,...,484. So, 484 is the 48th occurrence in the units place? Wait, 484 is 484, which is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4. So, 484 is the 49th occurrence because 4 is the first at 4, then 14, 24,...,484. So, from 4 to 484, that's 484 -4 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, so earlier I made a mistake. I thought it was 48, but it's actually 49.\n\nWait, but when I did the 4's count earlier, I had units place as 48, but that's incorrect. It should be 49.\n\nWait, let me correct that.\n\nSo, for 4's in units place: 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: floor(488/10)=48, and 488 mod 10=8, which is >=8, so add 1, so 49.\n\nSo, units place for both 4 and 8 is 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought for 4's it was 48, but that was wrong. It's actually 49.\n\nSo, let me correct the counts.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49\n\nTens place: 50 (from 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449: 5 blocks \u00d710=50)\n\nHundreds place: 89 (400-488)\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89= 188.\n\nWait, that's different from before. Earlier, I had 187, but now it's 188.\n\nWait, let me check again.\n\nWait, 4's in units place: 49\n\nTens place: 5 blocks of 10, so 50\n\nHundreds place: 89\n\nTotal: 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:49\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, so earlier I had 187 4's and 98 8's, difference 89, but now I'm getting 188 4's and 98 8's, difference 90.\n\nHmm, seems like I made a mistake in the initial count of units place for 4's. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, let me list the units place 4's:\n\n4,14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94,104,114,...,484.\n\nHow many are there? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 -4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49.\n\nYes, so 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place:8,18,28,...,488.\n\nFrom 8 to 488, stepping by 10. Number of terms: ((488 -8)/10)+1=480/10 +1=48+1=49.\n\nSo, units place for both is 49.\n\nSo, initial count for 4's units place was wrong; it's 49, not 48.\n\nSo, correcting that, total 4's are 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)= 188.\n\n8's are 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, so earlier I had 89, but now it's 90. Which is correct?\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's in the tens place.\n\nTens place for 4's: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449.\n\nEach block is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d710=50.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nHundreds place:400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nUnits place:49.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:49\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTotal:98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 89, but now I'm getting 90. I need to figure out where I went wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check that again.\n\nFrom 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. So, 89 hundreds place 4's. That's correct.\n\nSo, 4's total:49+50+89=188\n\n8's total:49+49=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 187, but that was because I had incorrectly counted units place as 48 instead of 49.\n\nSo, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the 8's in the tens place again.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488.\n\nEach of the first four blocks is 10 numbers, contributing 10 each, so 4\u00d710=40.\n\nThe last block,480-488, is 9 numbers, contributing 9.\n\nSo, total 40+9=49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 8's in tens place:49\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTotal 8's:98\n\n4's:188\n\nDifference:90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10, contributing 48 occurrences.

    "text": " Let me think about how to count the number of times the digits 4 and 8 appear in all the page numbers.\n\nI guess I should handle each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. That makes sense because each position can be treated independently when counting digit occurrences.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For the units digit, how often does each digit from 0 to 9 appear? Well, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit appears once in the units place every 10 numbers.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Let me calculate that. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). So, in each of these 48 blocks, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48, and the number of 8's is also 48. But wait, I also have those extra 8 numbers from 481 to 488. Let me check the units digits in that range. The units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in that extra block, the digit 8 appears once in the units place (488), and the digit 4 appears once (484). So, adding that, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's, it's 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that seems off because 488 is the last page, so maybe I should check if 488 is included correctly. Let me think again.\n\nWait, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so the units digits go up to 8. So, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 8 appears 48 times, and 9 appears 48 times as well, but wait, no, that's not correct. Because each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times in the units place across 480 pages, and then from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 through 8, so each of those digits appears once more. So, for digits 1 through 8, each appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and digits 9 and 0 appear 48 times each. So, in the units place, 4 appears 49 times, and 8 also appears 49 times. So, the count for units place is 49 each.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, in 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for the digit 4, in each hundred, it appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49 in the first hundred, 140-149 in the second, etc.). Similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in each hundred (80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\nSince there are 4 complete hundreds, the digit 4 appears 4 * 10 = 40 times in the tens place, and the same for 8, it's 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, we have the remaining 88 pages from 401 to 488. Let's look at the tens digits in this range. The tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digits in 401-488 are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Each of these digits appears how many times?\n\nFrom 401 to 488, the tens digits are as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0 (10 numbers)\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1 (10 numbers)\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2 (10 numbers)\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3 (10 numbers)\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4 (10 numbers)\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5 (10 numbers)\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6 (10 numbers)\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7 (10 numbers)\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8 (8 numbers)\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 481-488 is 8 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in this last partial hundred.\n\nSo, in the tens place for 401-488:\n\n- Digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450)\n- Digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488)\n\nSo, adding to the previous counts:\n\n- Digit 4 in tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50\n- Digit 8 in tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 8 = 48\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check again. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but each of the digits 0-8 appears a certain number of times. Specifically, digits 0-7 appear 10 times each (for 401-410, 411-420, etc.), but digit 8 appears only 8 times because the range stops at 488.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. From 401-488, the tens digits are as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 numbers)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 numbers)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10 numbers)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10 numbers)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 numbers)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10 numbers)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10 numbers)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10 numbers)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 numbers)\n\nSo, digits 0-7 each appear 10 times, and digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place:\n\n- Digit 4 appears 10 times in the partial hundred (441-450)\n- Digit 8 appears 8 times in the partial hundred (481-488)\n\nSo, adding to the complete hundreds:\n\n- Digit 4: 4*10 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50\n- Digit 8: 4*10 (from 1-400) + 8 (from 401-488) = 48\n\nWait, but I think I might have an error here. Because from 1-400, each digit in the tens place appears 40 times (4 hundreds, 10 times each). Then, from 401-488, digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (441-450), and digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, yes, 4's tens count is 40 +10=50, and 8's is 40 +8=48.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. Let's see, pages 1-99 have no hundreds digit, pages 100-199 have hundreds digit 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nSo, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit 1 (100 numbers)\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit 2 (100 numbers)\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit 3 (100 numbers)\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit 4 (89 numbers, since 488 - 400 +1 = 89)\n\nWait, 400 to 488 is 89 pages, so the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, how about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, the count for 8 in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, summarizing the hundreds place:\n\n- Digit 4: 89 times\n- Digit 8: 0 times\n\nNow, let's add up all the occurrences for each digit across units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nNow for digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal for 8: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nWait, let me check the calculations again because I might have made a mistake in adding.\n\nWait, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99, plus 89 (hundreds) gives 188 for 4's. For 8's, 49 (units) + 48 (tens) = 97, plus 0 = 97.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The question asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's, so we subtract 97 from 188.\n\n188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: 488 pages, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place for 480 pages, then 8 more pages where digits 1-8 appear once each. So, 4 appears 48 +1=49 times, and 8 appears 48 +1=49 times. Correct.\n\nTens place: Each complete hundred (100 pages) has each digit 0-9 appearing 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 40 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place. Then, from 401-488, the tens digits go up to 8. The digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, 4's tens count is 40+10=50, and 8's is 40+8=48. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So, 8's hundreds count is 0. Correct.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's total: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n8's total: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\nWe analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately:\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place for pages 1-480.\n   - Pages 481-488 add one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488).\n   - Total: 49 each.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times per hundred, totaling 40 times for each digit in 1-400.\n   - Pages 401-488 add 10 more 4's (441-450) and 8 more 8's (481-488).\n   - Total: 50 for 4, 48 for 8.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 add 89 occurrences of 4.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nSumming up:\n- 4's total: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's total: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 appears 91 more times than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Let me think about how to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each place one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, how often does 4 appear? Well, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So for example, from 1 to 10, 4 appears once (at page 4). From 11 to 20, it's at page 14, and so on.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8, it also appears once every 10 numbers in the units place. So 8 appears at 8, 18, 28, etc.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're dealing with complete blocks, there are 48 complete blocks of 10, and then an extra 8 pages (from 481 to 488). So in each of the 48 complete blocks, both 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So that's 48 times each. Now, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So in these, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49 times for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 times for 8. So the count for units place is equal for both digits.\n\nNext, let's move to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So in each hundred, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. So for the digit 4, in the tens place, it appears 10 times in every 100 numbers (like 40-49). Similarly, for 8, it appears 10 times in every 100 numbers (like 80-89).\n\nNow, how many hundreds do we have in 488 pages? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So let's think in terms of hundreds.\n\nIn the first 100 pages (1-100), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49), and 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n\nIn the next 100 pages (101-200), the tens digit 4 appears again from 140-149, which is another 10 times, and 8 appears from 180-189, another 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, in 201-300, 4 appears in 240-249 (10 times), and 8 in 280-289 (10 times).\n\nIn 301-400, 4 appears in 340-349 (10 times), and 8 in 380-389 (10 times).\n\nNow, after 400, we have pages 401-488. Let's see how the tens digit behaves here. The tens digit in 401-488 cycles from 0 to 8. So the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 401-488? Yes, because 440 is within 401-488, and 449 is also within that range. So that's another 10 times for 4 in the tens place.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place, it would appear in 480-489. But wait, our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the last partial hundred.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., up to 8 for 480-488. So the tens digit 8 is only present from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers. So in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in this last partial hundred.\n\nSo let me tally up the counts for the tens place:\n\n- For 4: In each full hundred (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), we have 10 times each, so 4 hundreds * 10 = 40 times. Plus in 401-488, another 10 times (from 440-449). So total 40 + 10 = 50 times for 4 in the tens place.\n\n- For 8: In each full hundred (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), 10 times each, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. Plus in 401-488, 9 times (from 480-488). So total 40 + 9 = 49 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but hold on, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So 4 in the tens place is 50 times, and 8 is 49 times.\n\nSo in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times. So 4 is ahead by 1 in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit cycles every 1000, so in 1-488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total for hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times\n\nFor 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- 488 pages, so units digit cycles 48 full times (48*10=480) plus 8 extra pages (481-488). So in each full cycle, 4 and 8 each appear once in units. So 48*1 + 1 (from 484) = 49 for 4. Similarly, 48*1 +1 (from 488) =49 for 8. So that's correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For 4: Each full hundred has 10 times in tens place, so 4 hundreds *10=40. Then in 401-488, 440-449 is 10 times. So 40+10=50.\n\n- For 8: Each full hundred has 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then in 401-488, 480-488 is 9 times. So 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times. 8 doesn't appear in hundreds place in 1-488.\n\nSo totals:\n\n4's: 49 +50 +89= 188\n\n8's:49 +49 +0=98\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place in the last partial hundred. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So 480,481,...488: that's 9 numbers, so 9 times. So that seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times.\n\nSo yeah, I think 90 is the correct difference.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, each digit (0-9) appears once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full decades (1-480) and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n   - **Count for 4:** 48 times in full decades + 1 (484) = 49.\n   - **Count for 8:** 48 times in full decades + 1 (488) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 full centuries (1-400) and a partial century (401-488).\n   - **Count for 4:** 4 centuries \u00d7 10 = 40 + 10 (440-449) = 50.\n   - **Count for 8:** 4 centuries \u00d7 10 = 40 + 9 (480-488) = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears from page 400 to 488, which is 89 times.\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n   - **Count for 4:** 89.\n   - **Count for 8:** 0.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider the digits in each place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me start by thinking about the units place. For every 10 pages, the digits 0 through 9 appear once in the units place. So, for example, pages 1-10 have 1,2,3,...,9,0 in the units place. Similarly, pages 11-20 have 1,2,3,...,9,0 again, and so on. So, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often. Now, how many times does each digit appear in the units place?\n\nSince the book has 488 pages, I can divide 488 by 10 to see how many complete sets of 10 there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 pages, and then 8 extra pages (pages 481-488). So, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times. But wait, the extra 8 pages (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8, so digits 1-8 each appear once more. So, for the units place:\n\n- The digit 4 appears 48 times in the units place from the complete sets, plus 1 more time in the extra pages, making it 49 times.\n- The digit 8 appears 48 times in the units place from the complete sets, plus 1 more time in the extra pages, making it 49 times as well.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so the extra pages are 481 to 488, which is 8 pages. So, units digits from 1 to 8 each appear once. So, for the units place, 4 and 8 each get an extra count. So, units place: 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit changes every 10 pages. For example, pages 1-9 have 0 in the tens place, pages 10-19 have 1, pages 20-29 have 2, and so on. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for every 100 pages. So, for 488 pages, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, which means there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). So, for the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 4 times in the tens place for each hundred, except for the last partial hundred.\n\nWait, actually, let me think again. Each hundred block (like 1-100) has 10 sets of 10 pages, so each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred. So, for 4 complete hundreds, each digit appears 4*10 = 40 times in the tens place. Now, the last partial hundred is 401-488, which is 88 pages. So, the tens digits here go from 0 (for 401-410) to 8 (for 480-488). So, each digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times in the tens place, except that 8 only appears 9 times because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, from 480-488, that's 9 pages (480-488), so the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages. So, in the tens place for 401-488:\n\n- Digits 0-7 each appear 10 times (from 401-410, 411-420, ..., 471-480).\n- Digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nSo, in the tens place, for the partial hundred:\n\n- 0: 10 times\n- 1: 10 times\n- 2: 10 times\n- 3: 10 times\n- 4: 10 times\n- 5: 10 times\n- 6: 10 times\n- 7: 10 times\n- 8: 9 times\n\nSo, in total, for the tens place:\n\n- Each digit from 0-7 appears 4*10 + 10 = 50 times.\n- Digit 8 appears 4*10 + 9 = 49 times.\n- Digit 9 appears 4*10 = 40 times (since the last partial hundred doesn't reach 490-499).\n\nWait, but I'm only concerned with digits 4 and 8, so let me focus on those.\n\nIn the tens place:\n\n- Digit 4 appears 50 times (4*10 in the complete hundreds and 10 in the partial hundred).\n- Digit 8 appears 49 times (4*10 in the complete hundreds and 9 in the partial hundred).\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check again. Each complete hundred (like 1-100) has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 complete hundreds mean 4*10 = 40 times each for digits 0-9 in the tens place. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. For each digit from 0 to 7, they appear 10 times (e.g., 401-410 has 0 in the tens place, 411-420 has 1, etc.), but for digit 8, it's from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, in the partial hundred:\n\n- 0: 10\n- 1: 10\n- 2: 10\n- 3: 10\n- 4: 10\n- 5: 10\n- 6: 10\n- 7: 10\n- 8: 9\n- 9: 0\n\nSo, in total:\n\n- Digit 4 in tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from partial) = 50\n- Digit 8 in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit changes every 100 pages. For a 488-page book, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\n- Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so 0 appears 99 times.\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so 1 appears 100 times.\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, so 2 appears 100 times.\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, so 3 appears 100 times.\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so 4 appears 89 times (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages).\n\nWait, no, 400 to 488 is 89 pages (488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- Digit 4 appears 89 times.\n- Digit 8 appears 0 times because the hundreds digit never reaches 8 in a 488-page book.\n\nSo, now, let's sum up the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each place.\n\nFirst, for digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nNow, for digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place for 4: 49, for 8: 49. Tens place for 4:50, for 8:49. Hundreds place for 4:89, for 8:0.\n\nSo, 4's total: 49 +50 +89 = 188. 8's total:49 +49 +0=98. Difference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place Analysis:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 sets (480 pages).\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488) add digits 1-8 once.\n   - **Count of '4' in units place:** 48 (complete sets) + 1 (extra) = 49.\n   - **Count of '8' in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place Analysis:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times per hundred pages.\n   - Complete hundreds: 4 sets (400 pages), so each digit appears 40 times.\n   - Partial hundred (401-488): 88 pages.\n     - Digits 0-7 each appear 10 times.\n     - Digit 8 appears 9 times (pages 480-488).\n   - **Count of '4' in tens place:** 40 (complete) + 10 (partial) = 50.\n   - **Count of '8' in tens place:** 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place Analysis:**\n   - Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0.\n   - Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1.\n   - Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2.\n   - Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3.\n   - Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times.\n   - **Count of '4' in hundreds place:** 89.\n   - **Count of '8' in hundreds place:** 0.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - More '4's than '8's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think about how to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately.\n\nAlright, let's start by considering each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll need to calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let me count the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place one by one.\n\n1. **Units place**: For every 10 numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, in 1-10, it's on page 4; in 11-20, it's on page 14, and so on. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and a partial block of 8 pages. In each full block, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Now, in the partial block (pages 481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, does 4 appear here? Yes, on page 484. So that's one more 4. So total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check that again. 488 divided by 10 is indeed 48.8, so 48 full blocks and then 8 extra pages. Each full block contributes 1, so 48. Then in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So 4 is present once. So yes, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place**: Now, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for pages 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, in 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10 times, and so on. Let's see how many hundreds are there in 488. There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). In each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So 4 hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449, which is 10 pages. So that's another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So that's 10 more. So total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. From 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400-488. So how many pages is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nSo total number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49+50=99, plus 89=188. So 188 4's.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's.\n\n1. **Units place**: Similar to 4's. For every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full blocks and 8 extra pages. Each full block gives 1, so 48. In the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once on page 488. So total units place 8's: 48 +1=49.\n\n2. **Tens place**: The tens digit 8 appears in blocks of 100. For example, in 1-100, it's 80-89, which is 10 times. Similarly, in 101-200, 180-189, another 10, and so on. Now, how many hundreds do we have? 4 full hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is pages 480-488. Wait, but the tens digit is 8 only in 480-489, but since our book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. Wait, but the tens digit is 8 for all these pages. So that's 9 times. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think again. The tens digit is 8 for any number where the tens place is 8. So in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So that's 9 times. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9=49.\n\nWait, but earlier, in the 4's, in the tens place, we had 50, and here it's 49? Hmm, that seems correct because 480-488 is only 9 pages, not 10. So 40 from the full hundreds and 9 from the partial, total 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 98 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I was counting 4's, I had 188. So the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. So 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place for 8's. So from 1-400, each hundred has 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then in 401-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So 40 + 9=49.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? For every 10 numbers, once. So 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full times, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1-8, so 8 appears once on 488. So 48 +1=49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the units place, we had 49. So 4's total 188, 8's total 98. So the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count all the 4's correctly? Let me recount.\n\n4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds:89\n\nTotal: 49+50=99 +89=188. That seems right.\n\n8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\n\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nSo 188-98=90. So 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting digits, especially in the hundreds place, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me check the hundreds place for 4's again.\n\nFrom 400-488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. So the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8, since the book ends at 488. So 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me think about the tens place for 8's again. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? So 9 times. So 40 (from the first four hundreds) +9=49. That's correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked all the parts, so the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, and hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - Total blocks of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full blocks and 8 extra pages.\n   - 48 * 1 = 48 occurrences.\n   - In the last 8 pages (481-488), 4 appears once (page 484).\n   - Total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49).\n   - 4 hundreds (1-400) contribute 4 * 10 = 40 occurrences.\n   - In 401-488, 440-449 adds another 10 occurrences.\n   - Total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - 48 full blocks contribute 48 occurrences.\n   - In the last 8 pages (481-488), 8 appears once (page 488).\n   - Total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89).\n   - 4 hundreds contribute 4 * 10 = 40 occurrences.\n   - In 401-488, 480-488 adds 9 occurrences (since 480-488 is 9 numbers).\n   - Total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think about how to count the number of times the digits 4 and 8 appear in each position\u2014units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place, I know that every 10 pages, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place. So for example, pages 1-10 have 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0 in the units place. So, for the units digit, the number of 4's would be the number of times 4 appears in the units place across all page numbers, and similarly for 8's.\n\nLet me calculate how many times each digit appears in the units place. The total number of pages is 488, so we can think of this as 488 divided by 10, which is 48 full sets of 10 pages, and then 8 extra pages (since 48*10=480, and 488-480=8). In each full set of 10, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place. So for 48 sets, the digit 4 appears 48 times in the units place, and the same for 8. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So in these, 4 appears once (page 484) and 8 appears once (page 488). Therefore, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. So in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. That means the difference here is zero.\n\nNext, I need to consider the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. In each block of 100 pages, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), etc., up to 9 (90-99). So for each digit, it appears 10 times in the tens place per 100 pages.\n\nNow, since the book has 488 pages, let's see how many full hundreds we have. 488 divided by 100 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). So, in each of these four hundreds, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and the same for 8 (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So for the four full hundreds, the digit 4 appears 4*10 = 40 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 4*10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Let's break this down. Pages 401-409: tens digit is 0. Pages 410-419: tens digit is 1. Pages 420-429: tens digit is 2. Pages 430-439: tens digit is 3. Pages 440-449: tens digit is 4. Pages 450-459: tens digit is 5. Pages 460-469: tens digit is 6. Pages 470-479: tens digit is 7. Pages 480-488: tens digit is 8.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so pages 480-488 are 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So in the tens place, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), how many times do 4 and 8 appear?\n\nLooking at the tens digit in 401-488:\n\n- 401-409: tens digit 0 (9 pages)\n- 410-419: tens digit 1 (10 pages)\n- 420-429: tens digit 2 (10 pages)\n- 430-439: tens digit 3 (10 pages)\n- 440-449: tens digit 4 (10 pages)\n- 450-459: tens digit 5 (10 pages)\n- 460-469: tens digit 6 (10 pages)\n- 470-479: tens digit 7 (10 pages)\n- 480-488: tens digit 8 (9 pages)\n\nSo, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in the block 440-449, which is 10 times. The digit 8 appears in the block 480-488, which is 9 times because it's only 9 pages (480-488). So in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in the remaining 88 pages.\n\nTherefore, total tens place 4's: 4*10 (from the four hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50.\n\nTotal tens place 8's: 4*10 (from the four hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times, making a difference of 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. Each page number from 1-99 has a hundreds digit of 0, which isn't printed, so we can ignore that. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299 it's 2; 300-399 it's 3; and 400-488 it's 4.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. Let's see how many pages that is: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nThe digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\nTotal hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences of 4 and 8 across units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nTotal 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems like a big difference.\n\nWait, when I calculated the units place, I considered that each digit appears 48 times for 48 full sets of 10 pages, and then in the remaining 8 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once. So 48 +1 =49 for both. That seems correct.\n\nFor the tens place, in each full hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So 4 full hundreds give 4*10=40 for 4 and 40 for 8. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449 (10 times) and 8 in 480-488 (9 times). So, 40 +10=50 for 4 and 40+9=49 for 8. That seems correct, so the difference in tens place is 1.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times (from 400-488) and 8 appears 0 times. So, 89 for 4 and 0 for 8.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Because from 400-488, that's 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's. But 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place anywhere, so 0.\n\nBut wait, in the tens place, I counted 10 times for 4 in 440-449 and 9 times for 8 in 480-488. But wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but when I'm adding up the 4's in the tens place, I had 4*10=40 from the four hundreds, plus 10 from 440-449, which is 50. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, 4*10=40 plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49.\n\nSo, the difference in the tens place is 1, and in the hundreds place, 89 for 4 and 0 for 8, so that's 89 more 4's.\n\nSo total difference is 89 (from hundreds) +1 (from tens) =90.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes I might have miscounted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this by counting the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nTotal number of units digits: For each digit from 0-9, how many times does it appear in the units place from 1 to 488.\n\nSince 488 divided by 10 is 48 full cycles, each digit appears 48 times. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So total units 4's:48 +1=49, units 8's:48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach digit appears 10 times per hundred. So for 488 pages, which is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each full hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So for 4's: 4*10=40, 8's:4*10=40.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-409) up to 8 (480-488). So let's see where 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\n- Tens digit 4: pages 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times.\n- Tens digit 8: pages 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens 4's:40 +10=50, tens 8's:40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-99, hundreds digit is 0 (not printed). From 100-199, hundreds digit is 1 (100 times). From 200-299, it's 2 (100 times). From 300-399, it's 3 (100 times). From 400-488, it's 4 (89 times).\n\nSo, hundreds 4's:89, hundreds 8's:0.\n\nNow, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, so I think my calculation is correct. So the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because the difference seems quite large. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times because pages 400-488 are 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times, so 1 more 4.\n\nIn the units place, both appear 49 times, so no difference.\n\nSo total 4's:89+50+49=188.\n\n8's:0+49+49=98.\n\n188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears 48 times in the units place within 480 pages (48 sets of 10).\n   - Pages 481-488 add one more 4 (page 484) and one more 8 (page 488).\n   - Total 4's in units: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's in units: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times per hundred, so 40 times for 4 and 40 times for 8 in the first 400 pages.\n   - Pages 401-488:\n     - 440-449: 10 times for 4.\n     - 480-488: 9 times for 8.\n   - Total 4's in tens: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's in tens: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488: 89 times for 4.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's in hundreds: 89.\n   - Total 8's in hundreds: 0.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think about how to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately\u2014units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, in 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, there's one 4 and one 8. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10, and then an extra 8 pages. So, in each of the 48 blocks, we have one 4 and one 8 in the units place. That gives 48 fours and 48 eights from the units place.\n\nBut wait, there's an extra 8 pages beyond the 480th page, which are pages 481 to 488. In these, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, we have another 4 (page 484) and another 8 (page 488). So, adding those, we have 48 + 1 = 49 fours and 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place. Wait, no, that can't be right because 488 is included. Let me check again.\n\nActually, from 1 to 480, there are 48 blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 48 fours and 48 eights. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 through 8. So, in these, the units digits include a 4 (484) and an 8 (488). So, that's 1 more four and 1 more eight. So, total fours in units place: 48 + 1 = 49, and eights: 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place contributes equally.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every block of 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), ..., up to 9 (90-99). So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred.\n\nNow, how many hundreds do we have in 488 pages? We have four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so it's four full hundreds (1-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nSo, for the tens digit, let's consider each hundred block:\n\n1. 1-100: The tens digit cycles from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\n2. 101-200: Similarly, the tens digits go from 0 (101-109) to 9 (190-199). So, again, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\n3. 201-300: Same pattern, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place.\n\n4. 301-400: Again, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times.\n\nNow, the last partial hundred is 401-488. Let's check the tens digits here. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears at least once. But how many times does each digit appear?\n\nFor each tens digit in 401-488, the tens digit is fixed for 10 numbers, except possibly the last one if it's cut short. So:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 numbers\n- 411-420: tens digit 1, 10 numbers\n- 421-430: tens digit 2, 10 numbers\n- 431-440: tens digit 3, 10 numbers\n- 441-450: tens digit 4, 10 numbers\n- 451-460: tens digit 5, 10 numbers\n- 461-470: tens digit 6, 10 numbers\n- 471-480: tens digit 7, 10 numbers\n- 481-488: tens digit 8, 8 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, in the tens place, in 401-488, the digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and the digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, for the tens place, in the last partial hundred, we have 10 fours and 8 eights.\n\nAdding this up:\n\nFor the full hundreds (1-400), each hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. There are four hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40 fours and 4 * 10 = 40 eights.\n\nIn the last partial hundred (401-488), we have 10 fours and 8 eights. So, total fours in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, and eights: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, tens place gives us 50 fours and 48 eights.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's zero. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1. From 200-299, it's 2. From 300-399, it's 3. From 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's.\n- 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, so no 4's or 8's.\n- 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, so no 4's or 8's.\n- 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so every page from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, we have 89 fours and zero eights.\n\nWait, let me check that calculation. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total fours in hundreds place: 89, and eights: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the fours and eights from each digit place.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal eights: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nNow, to find how many more fours than eights, subtract the total eights from total fours: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, from 481-488, units digits have 4 and 8, so +1 each, making 49 fours and 49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: For each full hundred (1-400), each hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digits have 10 fours (441-450) and 8 eights (481-488), so adding 10 fours and 8 eights. So, total fours: 40 + 10 = 50, eights: 40 + 8 = 48. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: Only from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 fours, and no eights. Correct.\n\nTotal fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal eights: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me check if I considered all the pages correctly, especially in the tens place for 401-488. From 401-488, the tens digits go up to 8, but does each tens digit from 0 to 8 appear exactly 10 times except for the last one?\n\nWait, 401-488 is 88 pages. Let me see:\n\n- 401-410: 10 pages, tens digit 0\n- 411-420: 10 pages, tens digit 1\n- 421-430: 10 pages, tens digit 2\n- 431-440: 10 pages, tens digit 3\n- 441-450: 10 pages, tens digit 4\n- 451-460: 10 pages, tens digit 5\n- 461-470: 10 pages, tens digit 6\n- 471-480: 10 pages, tens digit 7\n- 481-488: 8 pages, tens digit 8\n\nSo, yes, tens digits 0-7 each appear 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears once in 441-450, which is 10 fours, and 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 eights. So, that part is correct.\n\nAnother thing to check: When counting the hundreds place, I considered 400-488 as 89 pages, which is correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\nFours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\nEights: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It should be once every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, and then in the last partial set (481-488), 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's one more, making 49. Similarly for 8's, 488 is included, so 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nWait, but when I calculated the units place, I considered 48 full tens and then an extra 8 pages, which includes 484 and 488, so 1 more 4 and 1 more 8. So, units place: 49 fours and 49 eights.\n\nWait, but in the eights count, I had 49 in units, 48 in tens, and 0 in hundreds, totaling 97. Fours: 49 + 50 +89=188. So, 188 -97=91.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 91 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total units digits: 48 full sets of 10 (480 pages) + 8 extra pages.\n   - 4's: 48 (from full sets) + 1 (page 484) = 49.\n   - 8's: 48 (from full sets) + 1 (page 488) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Full hundreds (1-400): 4 sets, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's.\n   - 401-488: Tens digits 0-8, with 4's appearing 10 times (441-450) and 8's 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total 4's: 4\u00d710 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 4\u00d710 + 8 = 48.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 400-488: 89 pages, each contributing a 4.\n   - 4's: 89.\n   - 8's: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Wait, 488 is a three-digit number, so I might need to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the digit 8 also appears once (like 8, 18, 28, etc.). So in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear equally, right? But wait, does this hold true all the way up to 488? Let me check.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so there are 48 full cycles of 10 (since 48*10=480) and then 8 more numbers (481-488). In each full cycle, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So for 48 cycles, that's 48 fours and 48 eights. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So total in units place: 48+1=49 fours and 48+1=49 eights. So they're equal in the units place.\n\nNext, let me check the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0-9 ten times each. So in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and the digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89). Now, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4*10=40 fours. Similarly, 8 appears 4*10=40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0-8. So the tens digit 4 appears in 410-419, which is 10 times, and the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (from 410-419) and 8 appears 9 times (from 480-488). \n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So in the tens place, for the last partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times. So total tens place: 40+10=50 fours and 40+9=49 eights. So in the tens place, fours are more by 1.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. Each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has the hundreds digit fixed. So in the hundreds place, 4 appears only in the numbers 400-488. How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 +1 = 89). So 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo adding up all the digits:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal fours = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal eights = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears equally in the units place every 10 numbers.\n   - Total cycles of 10 in 488: 48 full cycles (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n   - In each cycle, 4 and 8 each appear once.\n   - Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times in each hundred (e.g., 40-49 for 4, 80-89 for 8).\n   - There are 4 full hundreds (1-400) and a partial hundred (401-488).\n   - Full hundreds: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 fours and 40 eights.\n   - Partial hundred (401-488): 4 appears 10 times (410-419), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89\n   - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place one by one. I'll start with the units place because that might be simpler. For the units digit, I know that in every block of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, in 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, there's exactly one 4 and one 8. \n\nNow, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then an extra 8 pages. So, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times in the first 480 pages. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once more in 484, and 8 appears once in 488. \n\nSo, for the units place:\n- Number of 4's: 48 (from the full blocks) + 1 (from 484) = 49\n- Number of 8's: 48 (from the full blocks) + 1 (from 488) = 49\n\nWait, so in the units place, they are equal? Hmm, that's interesting. So, the count for 4's and 8's in the units place is the same.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. In each block of 100 pages, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (in 1-9) to 9 (in 90-99). So, in each 100-page block, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, how many full 100-page blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an additional 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each of these 4 full blocks, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49 in each block), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89 in each block). So, for the tens place up to 400 pages, we have 4 times 10 = 40 occurrences of each digit 4 and 8.\n\nNow, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (in 401-410) up to 8 (in 480-488). Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit is 0\n411-420: tens digit is 1\n421-430: tens digit is 2\n431-440: tens digit is 3\n441-450: tens digit is 4\n451-460: tens digit is 5\n461-470: tens digit is 6\n471-480: tens digit is 7\n481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears once in 441-450 (10 times, actually, but wait, 441-450 is 10 numbers, so the tens digit is 4 for all of them. Similarly, 481-488 has the tens digit as 8 for 8 numbers (481-488 is 8 numbers, so 8 times 8 in the tens place? Wait, no, let me correct that.\n\nWait, from 481-488, the tens digit is 8 for each of those 8 numbers, so that's 8 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, in 441-450, the tens digit is 4 for each of the 10 numbers, so that's 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nSo, in the remaining 88 pages:\n- Number of 4's in tens place: 10\n- Number of 8's in tens place: 8\n\nTherefore, total in the tens place:\n- 4's: 40 (from full blocks) + 10 = 50\n- 8's: 40 (from full blocks) + 8 = 48\n\nSo, in the tens place, there are 50 4's and 48 8's. So, 4's are more by 2 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, in the first 99 pages, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0, but since we're only considering printed digits, those pages don't have a hundreds digit. So, starting from page 100, the hundreds digit becomes 1, then 2, 3, 4.\n\nIn each block of 100 pages, the hundreds digit remains the same. For example, 100-199: hundreds digit is 1; 200-299: 2; 300-399: 3; 400-488: 4.\n\nSo, let's calculate how many times each digit appears in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so 1 appears 100 times.\nFrom 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, 100 times.\nFrom 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, 100 times.\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, 89 times (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages).\n\nWait, 400-488 is 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n\nNow, we're interested in how many 4's and 8's appear in the hundreds place. \n\nLooking at the hundreds place:\n- 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 times.\n- 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4. There's no page 800-899, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n- Number of 4's: 89\n- Number of 8's: 0\n\nThat's a significant difference. So, 4's are way more in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each digit place.\n\nFirst, units place:\n- 4's: 49\n- 8's: 49\n\nTens place:\n- 4's: 50\n- 8's: 48\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nSo, total number of 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal number of 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because 188 - 97 is 91, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the steps.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 full blocks of 10, so 48 4's and 48 8's. Then, in the last 8 pages, 484 has a 4 in units, and 488 has an 8. So, units: 49 each.\n\nTens place: 4 full blocks of 100, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's, so 40 each. Then, in the last 88 pages, 441-450 contributes 10 4's, and 481-488 contributes 8 8's. So, tens: 50 4's and 48 8's.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAnd for 8's in the hundreds place, since the book ends at 488, there are no pages with hundreds digit 8, so 0. Correct.\n\nSo, the total 4's are 188, 8's are 97, difference is 91.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was thinking about the tens place, I thought 4's were more by 2, and hundreds place by 89, but let me see:\n\nWait, units place: same.\n\nTens place: 50 vs 48, so 2 more 4's.\n\nHundreds place: 89 vs 0, so 89 more 4's.\n\nSo, total difference: 2 + 89 = 91. That makes sense.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for the last 88 pages.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits:\n\n401-410: 0\n411-420:1\n421-430:2\n431-440:3\n441-450:4 (10 times)\n451-460:5\n461-470:6\n471-480:7\n481-488:8 (8 times)\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, yes, 10 and 8, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the counts are correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is that there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place for the first 480 pages.\n- Pages 481-488 add one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n- Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n- Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each digit appears 10 times in each 100-page block, totaling 40 times for 4 and 8 in the first 400 pages.\n- Pages 401-488 add 10 4's (441-450) and 8 8's (481-488).\n- Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n- Total 8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n- 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n- Total 4's: 89\n- Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:**\n188 - 97 = 91\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by looking at each digit place one by one.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every set of ten pages, the units digit cycles through 0 to 9. So, in each ten-page block, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. For example, from 1 to 10, the 4 is on page 4 and the 8 is on page 8. So, in each 10 pages, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place.\n\nNow, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, we'll consider 48 full blocks and then the remaining 8 pages. In each full block, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place, so that's 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once (on page 484) and the digit 8 appears once (on page 488). So, in total, the units place contributes 48 + 1 = 49 fours and 48 + 1 = 49 eights. Hmm, so in the units place, they are equal.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. In each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for example, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in pages 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in pages 80-89, also 10 times. Now, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? There are four hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and then 400-488. Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so we have four full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 400-488. \n\nSo, for each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and the same for 8. So, for four hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours and 40 eights. Now, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 appears in pages 440-449, which is 10 times, and the tens digit 8 appears in pages 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 times (480-488). So, in the tens place, we have 10 fours and 9 eights. Therefore, adding that to the previous totals: 40 + 10 = 50 fours and 40 + 9 = 49 eights. So, in the tens place, there's one more 4 than 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. So, from 1 to 99, the hundreds digit is 0, which doesn't count. From 100 to 199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299 is 2; 300-399 is 3; and 400-488 is 4. So, how many times does each hundreds digit appear?\n\nFor digit 4 in the hundreds place: pages 400-488. That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nFor digit 8 in the hundreds place: Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times and 8 appears 0 times. That's a significant difference.\n\nNow, let's sum up the totals for each digit place.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal fours = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal eights = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are, subtract the total eights from the total fours: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when adding up, it's easy to miscount.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then in the last 8 pages (481-488), units digits 4 and 8 each appear once, so 49 each. Correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights. Four full hundreds give 40 each. Then in the last partial hundred (400-488), tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, 50 fours and 49 eights. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times. Correct.\n\nAdding up fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Let me add them again: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Correct.\n\nEights: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. That seems right.\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each 10-page block has one 4 and one 8.\n   - 48 full blocks give 48 each.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) add one 4 and one 8.\n   - **Total:** 49 fours, 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each 100-page block contributes 10 fours and 10 eights.\n   - Four full hundreds give 40 each.\n   - The last partial hundred (400-488) adds 10 fours (440-449) and 9 eights (480-488).\n   - **Total:** 50 fours, 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 contribute 89 fours.\n   - No page numbers have an 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total:** 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\n**Summing Up:**\n- **Fours:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **Eights:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 fours - 98 eights = 90 more fours.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, does page 488 count as the last page? I think so, so the total number of pages is 488, which is a three-digit number. \n\nAlright, so I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. Let me structure this by looking at each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\nStarting with the units place. For each set of ten pages, like 1-10, 11-20, and so on, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once (like 4, 14, 24, etc.) and the digit 8 appears once (like 8, 18, 28, etc.). \n\nNow, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). So, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times, except for the last partial set where only digits 1 through 8 appear once each. \n\nWait, no, actually, each set of ten contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 complete sets, that's 48 times each. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does that mean the digit 4 appears once more in the units place (484), and the digit 8 appears once more (488)? So, for units place, 4's count is 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's count is 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, but wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit is 8, so that's correct. So, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again. Each complete set of ten (like 1-10, 11-20) has exactly one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 complete sets would have 48 4's and 48 8's. Then, the last partial set is 481-488, which has units digits 1-8. So, in this partial set, the units digit 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total for units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4's, and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8's. So, they are equal in the units place.\n\nMoving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. In each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (like 40-49), and the digit 8 appears 10 times (like 80-89). \n\nNow, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an extra 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 hundreds would have 4 * 10 = 40 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times per hundred, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. \n\nNow, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, the pages from 440-449 would have 4 in the tens place. That's 10 pages, so 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 in the tens place would appear in pages 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488), so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here, right? Because 480-488 is 9 pages, each with 8 in the tens place. Wait, but 480 is part of 401-488, so yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? It's when the tens digit is 4, which is 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. Similarly, 8 in the tens place is 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's count is 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50. And 8's count is 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, that seems right. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From page 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, because 800 would be page 800, which is beyond 488. So, 8 appears zero times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but wait, 488 is page 488, so the hundreds digit is 4, not 8. So, yes, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all.\n\nSo, summarizing the hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's add up all the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each digit place.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nNow for 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 complete sets of ten, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, the last partial set (481-488) has units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then, the partial hundred (401-488) has 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488). So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's. That adds up.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 appears 0 times. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly. From page 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times the hundreds digit is 4. That's correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nAnd for the tens place in the partial hundred, 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 times 8 in the tens place. That's correct.\n\nI think my calculations are accurate. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately:\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each set of ten pages (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) has one '4' and one '8'.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of ten in 480 pages, contributing 48 '4's and 48 '8's.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) add one more '4' (484) and one more '8' (488).\n   - Total: 49 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each hundred contains ten '4's and ten '8's in the tens place.\n   - Four complete hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 '4's and 40 '8's.\n   - The partial hundred (401-488) adds ten '4's (440-449) and nine '8's (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - Pages 400-488 have '4' in the hundreds place, contributing 89 '4's.\n   - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place within 488 pages.\n   - Total: 89 '4's and 0 '8's.\n\nSumming up:\n- Total '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- Total '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears, then subtract the two counts to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll go through each position one by one, counting the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each.\n\nFirst, the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in a complete set of numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. In each set of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same for 8. So, for 48 complete sets, that's 48 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place.\n\nNow, considering the extra 8 numbers beyond 48 sets of 10, which are 481 to 488. In these, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once in 484, and 8 appears once in 488. Therefore, in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, they're equal in the units place, which means the difference here is 0.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. Similarly, each digit from 0 to 9 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for the tens digit, in each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times (like 40-49), and the same for 8 (like 80-89). \n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an extra 88 numbers (401-488).\n\nIn each of the 4 complete blocks, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4*10 = 40 times. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in each block, so 4*10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, looking at the extra 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times, but since we only go up to 488, it's a bit less. Let's see: from 401-409, the tens digit is 0; 410-419, tens digit is 1; 420-429, tens digit is 2; 430-439, tens digit is 3; 440-449, tens digit is 4; 450-459, tens digit is 5; 460-469, tens digit is 6; 470-479, tens digit is 7; 480-488, tens digit is 8.\n\nSo, in this partial block, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers? Wait, 480 is the first, 481, 482, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers, but actually, from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers because 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in this partial block.\n\nWait, but let me check that. 480 is the first, then 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times the digit 8 in the tens place.\n\nSo, in the tens place, the total for 4 is 40 (from the complete blocks) + 10 (from the partial block) = 50 times. For 8, it's 40 (from complete blocks) + 9 (from partial block) = 49 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times. That means 4 is ahead by 1 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is a bit different because it's only non-zero in numbers from 100 onwards. Let's see, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so we can ignore that. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. How about 8? Well, in the hundreds place, 8 would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, 4 is ahead by 89 here.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nStarting with 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal for 8: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times\n\nSo, the difference is 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1 to 4 and 1 to 8 in units place. So, 48 each, plus the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), which have 4 in 484 and 8 in 488. So, 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- 4 complete hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10 times 4 and 10 times 8 in the tens place, so 4*10=40 each. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles. As I calculated earlier, 440-449 gives 10 times 4, and 480-488 gives 9 times 8. So, 40+10=50 for 4, and 40+9=49 for 8. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. 8 never appears because the book doesn't go beyond 488. So, 89 for 4, 0 for 8. Correct.\n\nAdding up:\n4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nYes, that seems right. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. By analyzing each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), we find that the digit 4 appears 188 times, while the digit 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me start by thinking about the units place. For every 10 pages, the digits 0 through 9 appear once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once every 10 pages. Now, how many times does the digit 4 appear in the units place? Well, in each set of 10 pages, it appears once. So, I can calculate how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488 pages and then see how many 4's are in the units place.\n\nWait, but 488 isn't a multiple of 10. The last set will be from 481 to 488, which is only 8 pages. So, I need to adjust for that. Let me think. The total number of complete sets of 10 in 488 pages is 48 because 48*10=480. Then, there are 8 pages left (481-488). So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears once every 10 pages, so 48 times from the complete sets. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once more in the units place. So, total 4's in units place would be 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, it also appears once every 10 pages. So, same calculation: 48 times from the complete sets and in the remaining 8 pages, the units digit 8 appears once (at page 488). So, total 8's in units place would be 48 +1=49 as well. Hmm, so in the units place, 4 and 8 appear the same number of times.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. From 1 to 480, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 48 times in the units place because 480/10=48. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (at 484), and 8 appears once (at 488). So yes, both 4 and 8 have 49 occurrences in the units place. So, no difference there.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred.\n\nNow, in a 488-page book, how many hundreds are there? Well, it's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages in the 401-488 range. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, in 400 pages, the digit 4 appears 4 times 10 = 40 times in the tens place. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Let me see: 401-410 has tens digit 0, 411-420 has 1, 421-430 has 2, 431-440 has 3, 441-450 has 4, 451-460 has 5, 461-470 has 6, 471-480 has 7, and 481-488 has 8. So, in this range, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 pages. So, that's 10 more occurrences. So, total 4's in tens place would be 40 +10=50.\n\nWait, but 441-450 is only 10 pages, right? So, that's correct. So, 4's in tens place: 50.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place. Let's see: In each hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, in 400 pages, that's 4 times 10 = 40 occurrences. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). But the tens digit here is 8, right? Because 480 is 48 0, so tens digit is 8, and 481 is 48 1, so tens digit is 8, up to 488. So, that's 9 pages where the tens digit is 8. So, in the remaining 88 pages, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place. So, total 8's in tens place would be 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 401-488, the tens digits go up to 8, as I thought. So, 480-488 is the last part, which is 9 pages where the tens digit is 8. So, yes, 9 occurrences. So, 40 (from the first 400 pages) +9=49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times. So, 4's have 1 more occurrence here.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. Each digit from 1-4 appears in the hundreds place for 100 consecutive pages. So, for example, 100-199 have 1 in the hundreds place, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's count in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. That's a significant difference.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 +50 +89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 +49 +0 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98 =90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n- 488 pages. Each 10 pages, 4 appears once in units. So, 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once. So, 48+1=49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears once every 10 pages, so 48 times, plus once in 488, so 49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n- For 4: Each hundred has 10 occurrences, so 4 hundreds (1-400) give 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 pages. So, 40+10=50. Correct.\n\nFor 8: Each hundred has 10 occurrences, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 40+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, 89 times. 8 never appears, so 0. Correct.\n\nAdding up:\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I thought about the units place, I thought 4 and 8 each had 49, but the tens place gives 4 an extra 1, and hundreds place gives 4 a lot more. So, the total difference is 90.\n\nBut wait, let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 pages. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. That seems correct. So, 4 has 89 more in hundreds place than 8.\n\nSo, overall, 4's are printed 90 times more than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I didn't make a mistake in the tens place for 8. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. How many pages is that? 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 pages, so 9 times. So, 40+9=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4 in the tens place, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 pages. So, 40+10=50. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, right? Because 488 -400 +1=89. So, each of those 89 pages has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. So, 4's in hundreds place:89, 8's:0. So, that's a big difference.\n\nSo, adding up all the digits, 4's have 49+50+89=188, and 8's have 49+49+0=98. So, 188-98=90. So, 4's are printed 90 times more than 8's.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - In 488 pages, there are 48 complete sets of 10, contributing 48 occurrences each for 4 and 8.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one more 4 and one more 8.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - In 400 pages, 4 appears 40 times, and 8 appears 40 times.\n   - From 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears, then subtract the two to find the difference.\n\nAlright, let me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I can calculate how many 4's and 8's appear.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, every 10 numbers, the digit cycles through 0 to 9. So in every block of 10 pages, the units digit is 4 exactly once and 8 exactly once. Therefore, for the units place, the number of 4's and 8's should be the same. But I need to check if this holds true all the way up to 488.\n\nWait, let me think. The total number of pages is 488, so the units digit cycles 48 full times (since 48*10=480) and then 8 more pages (481 to 488). So in each full cycle of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So for 48 full cycles, that's 48 4's and 48 8's. Now, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1 to 8. So in these, the units digit 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So in total, units place contributes 49 4's and 49 8's. Wait, no, that's not right. Because 48 full cycles would give 48 4's and 48 8's, and the last 8 pages add one more 4 and one more 8. So total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 4's and 48 +1 = 49 8's. So the units place actually has the same number of 4's and 8's, 49 each.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so page 488 has units digit 8. So in the last partial cycle, units digits go up to 8, so 484 is the only 4, and 488 is the only 8. So yes, units place has 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nMoving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So for example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 ten times (40-49) and 8 ten times (80-89). Similarly, in 101-200, it's the same pattern, and so on.\n\nBut since the book ends at 488, which is less than 500, I need to check how many full hundreds we have and if there's a partial hundred.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, we have four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488.\n\nWait, actually, 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. So that's four full hundreds and a partial hundred.\n\nIn each full hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49) and 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So for four full hundreds, that's 4*10=40 4's and 4*10=40 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? It's from 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, our range is up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488. So that's 10 4's in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? From 480-488, which is 9 times, because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481,...,488). Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the partial hundred.\n\nSo adding up, in the tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) +10 (from partial) =50 4's, and 40 +9=49 8's.\n\nSo in the tens place, there are 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. Wait, actually, 400-488 has hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo let's calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place.\n\nFirst, 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. The hundreds digit can only be 1,2,3, or 4. So the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nNow, how many 4's are there in the hundreds place? From 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo summarizing the hundreds place: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nNow, let's add up the counts from each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's =49+50+89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's=49+49+0=98\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's)=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 full tens (each contributing one 4 and one 8) and then 8 more pages where 4 and 8 each appear once. So 48+1=49 for both.\n\nTens place: Each full hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's. Four full hundreds give 40 each. Then in 401-488, tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So total tens place 4's:40+10=50, 8's:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 4's from 400-488:89 times, 8's:0.\n\nSo total 4's:49+50+89=188, 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but wait, when I was counting the units place, I thought that in the last 8 pages, units digits go up to 8, so 484 is 4, and 488 is 8. So that's one each. So units place:49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: In the partial hundred, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So 40+9=49 8's in tens place.\n\nSimilarly, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 4's in tens place, making it 40+10=50.\n\nHundreds place: 89 4's, correct.\n\nSo total 4's:188, 8's:98, difference 90.\n\nHmm, but I'm a bit confused because 488 is the last page, so in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 4's. That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. For units digit, in 1-488, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see: every 10 pages, 4 appears once. So 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus in the last partial cycle (481-488), 484 is the only 4, so 48+1=49. Similarly for 8's, same logic.\n\nSo yes, units place:49 each.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, 10 4's and 10 8's. So 4 hundreds would be 40 each. Then in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 times. So 40+10=50 for 4's, and 40+9=49 for 8's.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 4's, and no 8's.\n\nSo total 4's:49+50+89=188, 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me check again. The hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488. So that's 488-400+1=89 pages. So 89 4's in the hundreds place, correct. And no 8's in hundreds place, correct.\n\nSo yeah, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I was counting the tens place, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes up to 8, but does it include 480-488? Yes, so that's 9 times for 8 in the tens place. And 440-449 is 10 times for 4 in the tens place. So that seems correct.\n\nSo I think my calculation is right, and the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so each digit appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total page numbers: 488.\n   - Number of complete cycles of 10: 48 (since 48*10=480).\n   - In each cycle, '4' and '8' each appear once in the units place, contributing 48 each.\n   - Remaining pages: 481-488 (8 pages), where units digits are 1-8.

    "text": " I should probably check how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8, then subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by analyzing the units place. For every 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in the units place, each digit, including 4 and 8, appears exactly once every 10 pages. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, from page 1 to 488, there are 488 pages, which means 488 divided by 10 is 48 full groups of 10, with 8 pages remaining. So, in each group of 10, 4 appears once in the units place, so 48 times, plus one more in the remaining 8 pages if the 4 is within that range. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the 49th group starts at 481 and ends at 490, but our book ends at 488, so the units digit goes up to 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times, and 8 appears 48 times as well, because in each group of 10, both 4 and 8 appear once. Wait, but in the last partial group, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, both 4 and 8 have 49 occurrences in the units place? Wait, no, because 488 is included, so from 1 to 488, how many times does each digit appear in the units place?\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to calculate it as follows: For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often, except possibly for the last partial set. So, total number of complete decades (groups of 10) is 48 (since 480 is the last multiple of 10 before 488). So, in each complete decade, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place, so 48 times each. Then, in the last partial decade (pages 481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (page 484) and 8 appears once (page 488). So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 times for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 times for 8. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, in each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. Now, how many hundreds do we have in 488 pages? Well, we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages in the 401-488 range. So, for the tens place, in each of the first four hundreds, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49 in the first hundred, 140-149 in the second, etc.), same for 8, which would be 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, for 4, that's 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 times = 40 times. Similarly, for 8, it's also 40 times.\n\nNow, in the last partial hundred, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is 4 8 8). So, the tens digit cycles through 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), up to 8 (481-490, but we only go up to 488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Well, 440-449 would have the tens digit as 4, but wait, 440 is in the 400-499 range, but our book only goes up to 488. So, 440-449 is within 401-488. So, from 440-449, that's 10 pages where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 10 times. Similarly, for 8 in the tens place, we have 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so that's 9 pages (480-488), so the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages. Wait, but actually, 480-489 is a full set of 10, but since we stop at 488, it's 9 pages. Wait, but 480 is included, so pages 480-488 are 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages in this partial hundred.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490). So, in the tens place, 4 appears when the tens digit is 4, which is from 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 10 times for 4 in the tens place in the last partial hundred. For 8, the tens digit is 8 from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 9 pages (480-488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred.\n\nSo, total for the tens place: 4's are 40 (from the four full hundreds) + 10 (from the last partial hundred) = 50 times. 8's are 40 (from four full hundreds) + 9 (from the last partial hundred) = 49 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times. So, the difference here is 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 1 from 1-99, 2 from 100-199, 3 from 200-299, and 4 from 300-399 and 400-488. Wait, but 300-399 is 100 pages, and 400-488 is 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's 89 times, once for each page from 400 to 488.\n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit never reaches 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, the count for 8 in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n- Each full decade (1-10, 11-20, etc.) has one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n- There are 48 full decades in 480 pages, so 48 each.\n- Then, from 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n- So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nTens place:\n- Each full hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n- So, 4 full hundreds (1-400) give 4\u00d710=40 each.\n- In the last partial hundred (401-488), 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n- So, 4's: 40 + 10 = 50; 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place because 488 < 800.\n\nTotal counts:\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for the last partial hundred.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490). So, when the tens digit is 4, it's from 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, that's correct. For 8, it's from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 pages. So, yes, 9 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nSo, the total difference is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, right? Because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nAnother way to think about it: The hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything else. Did I consider all possible positions? Units, tens, hundreds. Yes, because 488 is a three-digit number, so each page number up to 488 is either one, two, or three digits, but leading zeros aren't counted, so only the actual digits present are considered. So, I think I covered all the cases.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48 groups.\n   - Each digit appears 48 times in the units place.\n   - In the remaining 8 pages (481-488), 4 and 8 each appear once.\n   - Total: 49 times each.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times in each group of 100.\n   - Four complete hundreds (1-400): 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 times each.\n   - In the last partial hundred (401-488):\n     - 4 appears 10 times (440-449).\n     - 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 times for 4, 49 times for 8.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears from page 400 to 488: 89 times.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I should probably look at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nLet me start by thinking about the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So in each block of 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once (like 4, 14, 24, etc.) and the digit 8 also appears once (like 8, 18, 28, etc.). So, for every 10 pages, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. \n\nNow, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 pages and then 8 extra pages. In each of these 48 blocks, the units digit 4 and 8 each appear once, so that's 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So in these last 8 pages, the units digit 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So for the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's, which is also 49. So, in the units place, they are equal.\n\nNext, let's consider the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages, right? For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (like 40-49) and the same for 8 (like 80-89). So in each 100 pages, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages left (401-488). \n\nIn each of these 4 full hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times each hundred, so that's also 40 times. Now, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times, but since we're only going up to 88, it's actually 8 full cycles (401-480) and then 8 more pages (481-488). \n\nWait, let me correct that. From 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490), but since we're stopping at 488, the last part is 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, in the tens place, from 401-480, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 7, each appearing 10 times, and then from 481-488, the tens digit is 8 for all 8 pages. \n\nSo, in the tens place for 401-480, the digit 4 appears once (440-449), which is 10 times, and the digit 8 appears once (480-489), but wait, 480-489 is 10 pages, but we're only going up to 480. So in 401-480, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and the tens digit 8 appears 10 times (480-489), but since we're stopping at 480, does that affect it? Wait, no, because 480 is included in 401-480, so 480 is part of that range. So, in 401-480, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 10 times. Then, in 481-488, the tens digit is 8 for all 8 pages, so that's an additional 8 times for the digit 8 in the tens place. \n\nSo, in the tens place, the total number of 4's is 40 (from the four hundreds) + 10 (from 401-480) = 50. And the total number of 8's is 40 (from the four hundreds) + 10 (from 401-480) + 8 (from 481-488) = 58. Wait, that can't be right because from 401-480, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times, and then from 481-488, it's another 8 times. So total for 8's in tens place is 40 + 10 + 8 = 58, while for 4's it's 40 + 10 = 50. So in the tens place, 8's appear 8 more times than 4's.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1-400, the tens digit 4 appears 4*10=40 times, and 8 appears 4*10=40 times. Then from 401-480, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 10 times (480-489, but since we're stopping at 480, does that mean only 10 times up to 480? Wait, 480 is part of the 401-480 range, so 480 is included, so the tens digit 8 appears 10 times in 401-480. Then, from 481-488, the tens digit is 8, so that's 8 more times. So total for 8's in tens place is 40 + 10 + 8 = 58, and for 4's it's 40 + 10 = 50. So in the tens place, 8's are 8 more than 4's.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 1 for 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and then 4 again for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, so that's 89 times. \n\nWhat about the hundreds digit 8? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit never reaches 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, the hundreds digit 8 appears zero times. \n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times and 8 appears 0 times. Therefore, in the hundreds place, 4's are 89 more than 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 58\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 58 + 0 = 107\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my calculations again. \n\nWait, earlier in the tens place, I thought 4's were 50 and 8's were 58, but let me confirm:\n\nFrom 1-400:\n- Tens digit 4: 4*10 = 40\n- Tens digit 8: 4*10 = 40\n\nFrom 401-480:\n- Tens digit 4: 10 (440-449)\n- Tens digit 8: 10 (480-489, but since we're only going up to 480, is that 10 times? Wait, 480 is the 10th page in that tens group, so yes, 10 times.\n\nFrom 481-488:\n- Tens digit 8: 8 times (481-488)\n\nSo, total tens digit 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\nTotal tens digit 8's: 40 + 10 + 8 = 58\n\nUnits digits:\n- Each digit from 0-9 appears equally in units place. For 488 pages, there are 48 full decades (48*10=480) plus 8 pages. In each decade, 4 and 8 each appear once in units place. So, 48*1 + 1 (from 484) = 49 for 4's, and 48*1 + 1 (from 488) = 49 for 8's.\n\nHundreds digits:\n- 4 appears from 400-488: 89 times\n- 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 58 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 107\n\nWait, but 188 - 107 = 81. So, there are 81 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again because I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. From 401-480, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times (480-489), but since we're only going up to 480, is that 10 times? Because 480 is the 10th page in that tens group, so yes, 10 times. Then from 481-488, the tens digit is 8 for all 8 pages, so that's 8 more. So, total 10 + 8 = 18 times in the tens place for 8's in the 401-488 range. So, from 1-400, 40 times, plus 18 times, so total 58 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, from 1-400, 40 times, plus 10 times in 401-480, so total 50 times.\n\nSo, 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n8's: 49 + 58 + 0 = 107\nDifference: 188 - 107 = 81\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought about it, I thought the difference might be 81, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, another way to calculate is to consider each digit place separately and sum them up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position.\n\nLet me try another approach for the units place:\n\nTotal number of units digits: 488 pages, so for each digit 0-9, how many times does each appear in the units place?\n\nThe number of times each digit appears in the units place is floor(488 / 10) = 48 full cycles, each contributing 1 occurrence per digit, and then the remaining 8 pages (481-488) contribute digits 1-8.\n\nSo, for digit 4: 48 times from the full cycles, plus 1 more from the remaining pages (484), total 49.\n\nFor digit 8: 48 times from the full cycles, plus 1 more from the remaining pages (488), total 49.\n\nSo, units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach digit appears 10 times every 100 pages. So, total number of tens digits is 488 / 100 = 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 times per digit, and then the remaining 88 pages.\n\nWait, actually, the number of times each digit appears in the tens place is:\n\nFor each hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 hundreds (1-400), each digit appears 4*10 = 40 times.\n\nThen, from 401-488, which is 88 pages, the tens digit cycles through 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in 401-480, which is 80 pages, the tens digit goes from 0-7, each appearing 10 times. Then, from 481-488, the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages.\n\nSo, for the tens digit:\n\nDigit 4: in 401-480, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449). So total 40 (from 1-400) + 10 = 50.\n\nDigit 8: in 401-480, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times (480-489, but since we're only going up to 480, does that mean 10 times? Yes, because 480 is included. Then, from 481-488, the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages. So total for 8's in tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-480) + 8 (from 481-488) = 58.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nDigit 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times.\n\nDigit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0.\n\nAdding them up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) + 58 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 107\n\nDifference: 188 - 107 = 81.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 81 more than the number of 8's.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just double-check the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those, so 89 times. And since the book doesn't go beyond 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 0 times. That seems right.\n\nIn the tens place, I had to be careful about the partial hundreds. From 401-480, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times. Then, from 481-488, 8 appears 8 more times. So, 10 + 8 = 18 times for 8's in the tens place beyond the initial 40, making it 58. For 4's, it's 10 times beyond the initial 40, making it 50.\n\nUnits place was straightforward: 49 each.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's total 188 and 8's total 107, so the difference is 81.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place Analysis:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears equally in the units place every 10 pages.\n   - Total full decades in 488 pages: 48 (since 48*10 = 480).\n   - Each digit appears 48 times in the units place.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488) contribute digits 1-8, adding one more '4' (at 484) and one more '8' (at 488).\n   - **Total '4's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Total '8's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place Analysis:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Total full hundreds in 488 pages: 4 (1-400).\n   - Each digit appears 4*10 = 40 times in the tens place.\n   - From 401-480 (80 pages), digits 0-7 each appear 10 times, and digit 8 appears 10 times (480-489, but only up to 480).\n   - From 481-488, digit 8 appears 8 times.\n   - **Total '4's in tens place:** 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-480) = 50.\n   - **Total '8's in tens place:** 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-480) + 8 (from 481-488) = 58.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place Analysis:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n   - **Total '4's in hundreds place:** 89.\n   - **Total '8's in hundreds place:** 0.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 58 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 107.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 107 (8's) = 81.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe digit '4' is printed 81 more times than the digit '8' in the page numbers.\n\n\\boxed{81}"

    "text": " I should probably check if I need to consider four-digit numbers, but since 488 is a three-digit number, I don't think so. \n\nAlright, so I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. Let me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, let's count the number of times 4 appears in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (at page 4). From 11-20, it appears once at page 14, and so on. \n\nSo, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and a partial set of 8 numbers (481-488). In each complete set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the partial set from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire block of 100 numbers. Specifically, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. \n\nLet's count how many such blocks exist up to 488. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks in total. So, that's 5 times 10, which is 50 occurrences. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, hold on, that might not be accurate. Let me check. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 times. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times.\n\nNow, let me add up all the 4's: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89). That gives 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, the digit 4 appears 187 times in total.\n\nNow, I need to do the same for the digit 8. Let's go through each place again.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, in each set of 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-10, 8 appears at page 8. From 11-20, at 18, and so on. \n\nSo, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488? 48 complete sets, as before. So, 48 times. Now, the partial set from 481-488: the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, the total number of 8's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks has 10 occurrences of the digit 8 in the tens place. \n\nLet me count how many such blocks exist up to 488. The first block is 80-89, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four blocks. So, 4 times 10 is 40 occurrences. Now, does 480-489 fall within 488? Yes, but 480-489 is beyond 488, so we only go up to 488. So, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but only for 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, actually, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, how many times does 8 appear? \n\nWait, I think I made a mistake here. Earlier, I considered four blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 40. But then, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but it's only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 more times. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's five blocks, but the last block is only 9 numbers instead of 10. So, 4 full blocks of 10 and one partial block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, yes, 49 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 times.\n\nWait, but let me check. The hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, yes, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier, when I counted 8's in the tens place, I thought it was 49, and units place was 49, so total 98. But let me double-check because that seems high. Let me recount the tens place.\n\nWait, earlier I thought that in the tens place, 8 appears in 80-89 (10 times), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 times). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. So, yes, 49 times in the tens place. So, total 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but when I counted 4's, I got 187, and 8's are 98. So, the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89. But I feel like that might be correct, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nWait, let me check the 4's again. Units place: 48 times, tens place: 50 times, hundreds place: 89 times. So, 48+50=98, plus 89 is 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's: units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. So, 49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. From 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but how many times does 8 appear in the tens place there? Let's see, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, in each of these, the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 times. So, yes, 9 times in the tens place for the 480-488 range. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I counted the tens place for 4's, I included 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But in the 8's case, the last block is only 9 numbers. So, that's why the tens place for 8's is 49 instead of 50.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't overcount the 8's in the tens place. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then in the last partial set, 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once more. So, 48+1=49. That's correct.\n\nSo, adding up, 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98 for 8's.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 (4's) -98 (8's)=89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I remember sometimes when counting digits, especially in higher places, there can be overlaps or miscounts, so maybe I should check another approach.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately by considering each digit place and the number of times each digit appears.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each position up to a certain number. There's a formula for that, right?\n\nFor a given digit d and position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times d appears can be calculated based on higher digits and lower digits.\n\nBut maybe for simplicity, since the number isn't too large, I can stick to the method I used before.\n\nWait, but let me try to think of it differently. Maybe using a formula for each digit place.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is equal to (N // 10) * 1 + min(max(d, N % 10 + 1), 10). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me recall the formula correctly.\n\nActually, the formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is:\n\nIf d != 0, it's (N // 10) * 1 + (1 if (N % 10) >= d else 0).\n\nWait, no, that's not quite accurate. Let me think.\n\nIn each block of 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, up to N, the number of complete blocks is N // 10, and in each block, the digit d appears once. Then, in the partial block, if the units digit of N is >= d, then d has appeared once more; otherwise, it hasn't.\n\nWait, but for d=0, it's a bit different because 0 doesn't appear in the units place for numbers like 1-9. So, for d=0, the count is (N // 10) - 1 if N >= 10, plus 1 if N % 10 == 0.\n\nBut in our case, we're dealing with d=4 and d=8, so non-zero digits.\n\nSo, for the units place:\n\nNumber of 4's = (488 // 10) * 1 + (1 if (488 % 10) >=4 else 0)\n= 48 *1 + (1 if 8 >=4 else 0)\n=48 +1=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I got 48 for 4's in the units place. Hmm, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me check again. Wait, when I was counting 4's in the units place, I thought that in each set of 10, 4 appears once, and there are 48 complete sets (since 488//10=48), and then in the partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once. So, 48 +1=49. But earlier, I thought the units place for 4's was 48. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, in my initial counting, I thought that the units place for 4's was 48, but using this formula, it's 49. So, I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me recount. From 1-10, 4 appears once. 11-20, once, and so on. So, 488//10=48, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48. Then, in the partial set 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once. So, total 48+1=49. So, I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought it was 48. So, the correct count for 4's in the units place is 49.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I was calculating 4's, I thought units place was 48, but that was a mistake. So, that changes things.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: same approach. 488//10=48, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the partial set 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once. So, total 48+1=49. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought units place for 4's was 48; it's actually 49.\n\nSo, let's recalculate the total number of 4's.\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place: Let's recalculate.\n\nIn the tens place, for each block of 100 numbers, the digit d appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4's in the tens place, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n\nEach of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences. So, 5 blocks, so 5*10=50.\n\nBut wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct.\n\nSo, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 187, but that was because I had mistakenly counted units place as 48 instead of 49. So, correct total is 49+50=99, plus 89=188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place: Let's recalculate.\n\nIn the tens place, 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n\nEach of the first four blocks contributes 10 occurrences, so 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, contributes 9 occurrences (since 488 is the last page). So, total 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:0, as before.\n\nSo, total 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)=98.\n\nSo, now, the difference is 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89, but that was due to a miscalculation in the units place for 4's. So, correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure again.\n\nWait, when I used the formula for units place, I got 49 for 4's, which makes sense because in the last partial set, 481-488, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 488//10=48, plus 1 for the partial set, total 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, same logic:48+1=49.\n\nSo, 4's:49+50+89=188\n\n8's:49+49=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the answer was 89, but now it's 90. I must have made a mistake in my initial counting.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's in the units place.\n\nFrom 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 488//10=48, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial set, 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once. So, total 48+1=49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the units place:48+1=49.\n\nSo, 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89, but that was due to a miscalculation. So, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm overcounting the hundreds place for 4's.\n\nWait, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so 89 times. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 5*10=50. That's correct.\n\nUnits place:49.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:40-80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. So, 4 full blocks of 10, and one partial block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nSo, 49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I recall sometimes when counting digits, especially in the higher places, you have to be careful about overlaps or whether the last block is complete. But in this case, I think the counting is accurate.\n\nWait, another way to check is to consider that for each digit place, the count is as follows.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10)=48, plus 1 if the last digit is >=4, which it is (8>=4), so 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's: floor(488/10)=48, plus 1 if last digit >=8, which it is (8>=8), so 48+1=49.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100)=4 (since 488/100=4.88), so 4 complete blocks of 100, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the partial block (400-488), the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, 140-149, etc., but wait, no, that's not the right way.\n\nWait, actually, for the tens place, the formula is a bit different. The number of times a digit d appears in the tens place up to N is:\n\nhigher = N // 100\n\ncurrent = (N // 10) % 10\n\nlower = N % 10\n\nif d < current: count = (higher +1) * 10\n\nelif d == current: count = higher *10 + lower +1\n\nelse: count = higher *10\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe it's better to stick with the block method.\n\nWait, let me try this formula for 4's in the tens place.\n\nhigher = 488 // 100 =4\n\ncurrent = (488 //10) %10=8\n\nlower=488%10=8\n\nSo, for d=4:\n\nIf 4 < current (8), then count = (higher +1)*10 = (4+1)*10=50.\n\nSo, 50 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:\n\nd=8\n\nhigher=4\n\ncurrent=8\n\nlower=8\n\nSince d == current, count= higher *10 + lower +1=4*10 +8+1=40+9=49.\n\nSo, that matches our earlier counts.\n\nSo, using this formula, 4's in the tens place:50, 8's in the tens place:49.\n\nSimilarly, for the hundreds place:\n\nFor 4's, higher=488//1000=0\n\ncurrent=(488//100)%10=4\n\nlower=488%100=88\n\nSo, for d=4 in hundreds place:\n\nIf d < current (4 <4? No), so if d == current, then count= higher*100 + (if lower >=0, then 100, else 0). Wait, maybe the formula is different for hundreds place.\n\nAlternatively, since the hundreds digit is 4 for 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the hundreds place, since 800>488, it's 0.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n4's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:50\n\nHundreds:89\n\nTotal:49+50+89=188\n\n8's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:49\n\nHundreds:0\n\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that's accurate now. I had to correct my initial mistake where I thought the units place for 4's was 48 instead of 49, which led me to an incorrect difference of 89. After re-evaluating, the correct difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " I should probably handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me start by counting how many times the digit 4 appears in each place. \n\nStarting with the units place: The digits cycle every 10 numbers, so in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks and then 8 extra numbers. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times for the full blocks, plus one more time in the last partial block (since 484 is within the 481-490 range). So, that's 49 times in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for a whole block of 100 numbers, specifically from 40 to 49. Each of these 10 numbers contributes a 4 in the tens place. So, in each 100-number block, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Let's see, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 extra pages (401-488). In each of the first four blocks, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the partial block from 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, 1 for 410-419, and so on up to 8 for 480-488. Wait, actually, the tens digit in 401-409 is 0, so the digit 4 doesn't appear in the tens place here. So, in the partial block, the digit 4 in the tens place only appears in the 440-449 range, which is 10 times. So, total for the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding all these up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through each place again.\n\nUnits place: Similar to the 4's, in every block of 10, 8 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks and 8 extra. So, 48 times in the units place, plus one more in the last block (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences. How many such blocks are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 full blocks. So, 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 9 times. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800 and 899, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, the digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding these up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. \n\nFor the 4's:\n- Units: 48 full blocks (48) + 1 in the last 8 numbers (484) \u2192 49\n- Tens: 4 full blocks (40 each) \u2192 40, plus 10 in 440-449 \u2192 50\n- Hundreds: 89 (400-488)\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nFor the 8's:\n- Units: 48 +1 =49\n- Tens: 4*10=40, plus 9 in 480-488 \u2192 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 +49=98.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90. Yes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think about how to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately.\n\nI remember that when dealing with digit counting problems, it's often helpful to look at each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) individually and calculate the number of times each digit appears in each place. Then, I can sum them up for the total count of 4's and 8's.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in a sequence of numbers, right? So, for every block of 10 numbers, each digit appears once in the units place. For example, from 1 to 10, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n\nNow, for the tens place, it's similar but a bit different. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every block of 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), and so on up to 9 (90-99). So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for every 100 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, for the hundreds place, each digit from 1 to 9 appears 100 times in every block of 1000 numbers. But since our book only has 488 pages, the hundreds place will only go up to 4, because 488 is less than 500. So, the hundreds digit will be 1, 2, 3, or 4 for the numbers 100-488.\n\nWait, actually, the hundreds digit is 0 for numbers 1-99, then 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. But I think I might need to correct that because each hundred block (100-199, etc.) has 100 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 1 for 100 numbers, 2 for another 100, and so on. But since we're only going up to 488, the last hundreds block (400-488) is only 89 numbers, not 100. So, the hundreds digit for 4 appears 89 times, whereas the hundreds digits 1, 2, and 3 each appear 100 times.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, which is 100 numbers. Similarly, 2 for 200-299, another 100. 3 for 300-399, another 100. Then, 4 for 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times, and digits 1, 2, 3 appear 100 times each.\n\nBut wait, in the hundreds place, from 1 to 488, how many times does each digit appear? Let me calculate that.\n\nFrom 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's here in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, again no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, same here.\n\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and 8's don't appear here in the hundreds place because 488 is the last page, so the hundreds digit only goes up to 4.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place, 8 never appears because the book only goes up to 488, which is 4 in the hundreds place. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. Let's figure out how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place across all page numbers.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (1-9), 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), ..., 9 (90-99). Each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for every 100 numbers.\n\nBut since our book goes up to 488, we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488.\n\nWait, actually, 488 is page 488, so the last page is 488, meaning the tens digits go up to 8 in the last two digits (488). Let me approach this systematically.\n\nFirst, for each hundred block (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), we can calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nIn the first hundred (1-99):\n\n- The tens digit cycles from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 appears 10 times (40-49), and 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n\nIn the second hundred (100-199):\n\n- The tens digit again cycles 0-9, so 4 appears 10 times (140-149), and 8 appears 10 times (180-189).\n\nSimilarly, in the third hundred (200-299):\n\n- 4 appears 10 times (240-249), and 8 appears 10 times (280-289).\n\nIn the fourth hundred (300-399):\n\n- 4 appears 10 times (340-349), and 8 appears 10 times (380-389).\n\nNow, the fifth hundred would be 400-488. Let's check how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nFrom 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit cycles through 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Each of these digits appears 10 times except for the last one, which is only 9 times because we stop at 488.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. From 400-488, the tens digits are:\n\n- 0: 400-409 (10 numbers)\n- 1: 410-419 (10)\n- 2: 420-429 (10)\n- 3: 430-439 (10)\n- 4: 440-449 (10)\n- 5: 450-459 (10)\n- 6: 460-469 (10)\n- 7: 470-479 (10)\n- 8: 480-488 (9 numbers because 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, in the tens place for 400-488:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times (440-449)\n- 8 appears 9 times (480-488)\n\nTherefore, in the tens place across all page numbers:\n\n- 4's: 10 (first hundred) + 10 (second) + 10 (third) + 10 (fourth) + 10 (fifth) = 50 times\n- 8's: 10 (first hundred) + 10 (second) + 10 (third) + 10 (fourth) + 9 (fifth) = 49 times\n\nWait, that seems correct because in the fifth hundred, 8 appears only 9 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place. Let's calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units digit across all page numbers.\n\nIn the units place, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly once every 10 numbers. So, in each block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once and 8 appears once in the units place.\n\nNow, how many full blocks of 10 do we have in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full blocks (each of 10 numbers) and 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in each of the 48 full blocks, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), we check if 4 or 8 appears in the units place.\n\nWait, 481-488: the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n\nSo, total units place counts:\n\n- 4's: 48 blocks * 1 + 1 (from 484) = 49\n- 8's: 48 blocks * 1 + 1 (from 488) = 49\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Each block of 10 has one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 blocks give 48 each. Then, in the last 8 numbers, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 4's: 48 +1=49, and 8's: 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, but wait, 488 is included, so the last page is 488, so the units digits go up to 8. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each digit place.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89 (from 400-488)\n- 8's: 0\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4's: 50\n- 8's: 49\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 4's: 49\n- 8's: 49\n\nNow, total 4's = hundreds + tens + units = 89 + 50 + 49 = let's calculate that.\n\n89 + 50 is 139, plus 49 is 188.\n\nTotal 8's = 0 + 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 pages. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: For each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.), 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times, except for the last block (400-488), where 8 appears only 9 times. So, 4 appears 4 times 10 (from 1-400) plus 10 in 400-488? Wait, no. Wait, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in the 400-488 block. Wait, but earlier I thought 4's in tens place were 10 in each block, so 4 blocks (1-400) plus 10 in 400-488, making it 50. But 8's in the tens place were 10 in each of the first four blocks, and 9 in the last, making 49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm:\n\nIn 1-100: 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 10 4's in tens place.\n\nSimilarly, 100-199: 140-149, 10 4's.\n\n200-299: 240-249, 10 4's.\n\n300-399: 340-349, 10 4's.\n\n400-488: 440-449, 10 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 10*5 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place:\n\n1-100: 80-89, 10 8's.\n\n100-199: 180-189, 10.\n\n200-299: 280-289, 10.\n\n300-399: 380-389, 10.\n\n400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), so 9 8's.\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place: 10*4 +9=49.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nUnits place:\n\nEach block of 10 has one 4 and one 8. There are 48 full blocks (1-480), each contributing 1 4 and 1 8. Then, the last 8 numbers (481-488) have 484 and 488, so one 4 and one 8. So, total 4's: 48 +1=49, and 8's:48 +1=49.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: hundreds (89) + tens (50) + units (49) = 89+50=139+49=188.\n\n8's: hundreds (0) + tens (49) + units (49)=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the hundreds digit for 4 was 89, which seems correct because 400-488 is 89 pages. So, 89 4's in hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 pages, so 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there? The first term is 4, the last is 484. The common difference is 10, so the number of terms is ((484-4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 4's in units place.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: 8,18,28,...,488. The first term is 8, last is 488. Number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1=(480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 8's in units place. That's correct.\n\nTens place for 4's: as calculated, 50 times.\n\nTens place for 8's:49 times.\n\nHundreds place for 4's:89 times.\n\nHundreds place for 8's:0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's:89+50+49=188.\n\nTotal 8's:0+49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because 488 is the last page, so in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, which is correct because 488-400+1=89.\n\nWait, 400 to 488 inclusive is 89 numbers: 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so 188-98=90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n\nWait, but let me just think again if I missed anything. For example, in the hundreds place, 8 never appears because the book doesn't go beyond 488, so hundreds digit is 4 at maximum, so 8 doesn't appear in hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place, for each hundred block, 8 appears 10 times except in the last block where it's 9 times because we stop at 488.\n\nIn the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's:89+50+49=188, 8's:49+49=98, difference 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (pages 400-488).\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears 10 times in each of the first four hundreds (1-400) and 10 times in 400-488, totaling 50 times.\n   - 8 appears 10 times in each of the first four hundreds and 9 times in 400-488, totaling 49 times.\n\n3. **Units Place:**\n   - Both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each, as they cycle every 10 numbers.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 50 (tens) + 49 (units) = 188\n- 8's: 0 (hundreds) + 49 (tens) + 49 (units) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me start by thinking about the units place. For every group of 10 pages, the digits 0 through 9 appear once in the units place. So, for example, pages 1-10 have each digit from 0 to 9 in the units place once, except page 1 which doesn't have a 0. Wait, actually, no, page 1 is just 1, so in the first 10 pages, the units digits go from 1 to 0 (for page 10). So, every 10 pages, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. \n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, every 100 pages, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, pages 1-100: the tens digit cycles from 0 (pages 1-9) to 9 (pages 91-100). Each digit in the tens place appears 10 times per hundred. \n\nFor the hundreds place, it's similar but only starts at page 100. From page 100 to 488, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, actually, page 100 is the first page with a hundreds digit, and it goes up to page 488, which is a three-digit number starting with 4.\n\nSo, perhaps I should calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately and then sum them up.\n\nLet me first calculate the number of 4's in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place: how many times does 4 appear in the units digit from 1 to 488?\n\nSince every 10 pages, 4 appears once in the units place. So, total number of groups of 10 in 488 pages is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a group, it's 48 full groups, each contributing one 4. So that's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the 48th group ends at page 480, and then we have pages 481-488. In those remaining 8 pages, the units digit cycles from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (page 484). So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: how many times does 4 appear in the tens digit?\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears in a block of 100 pages, specifically from page x40 to x49, where x is the hundreds digit. So, for each hundred, there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many hundreds we have.\n\nFrom page 1 to 488, we have 4 full hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds digits go up to 4. So, for each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, for hundreds 1, 2, 3, and 4, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. But wait, the last hundred is only up to 488, so does the tens digit 4 appear fully in that last hundred? Let's check.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 appears in pages 440-449, which is a full 10 pages. So, yes, each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds * 10 = 40 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but the first hundred is 1-100. Does page 100 have a tens digit of 0, so the 4 in the tens place would be from 40-49 in each hundred. So, in the first hundred (1-100), the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly for the next hundreds. So, yes, 4 hundreds * 10 = 40 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds digit?\n\nFrom page 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (including both 400 and 488). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 40 + 89 = let's see, 49+40=89, 89+89=178. So, 178 4's.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of 8's in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place: how many times does 8 appear in the units digit from 1 to 488?\n\nSimilarly to 4's, every 10 pages, 8 appears once. So, 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more (page 488). So, total units place 8's: 48 +1=49.\n\nNext, the tens place: how many times does 8 appear in the tens digit?\n\nIn the tens place, 8 appears in blocks like x80 to x89. So, for each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times. Let's check how many hundreds we have.\n\nAgain, from 1-488, we have 4 full hundreds. Each hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except perhaps the last one if it's cut off. Wait, the last hundred is 400-488, so the tens digit 8 would be from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 pages (480-488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place for the last hundred.\n\nWait, let me clarify. In the tens place, each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit from 0-9 in the tens place, except when the hundred is cut short. So, for the first three hundreds (1-399), each has 10 8's in the tens place. The last hundred is 400-488, which is 89 pages. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 8's in the tens place for the last hundred.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 3 hundreds *10 + 1 hundred *9 = 30 +9=39.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check. From 1-100, the tens digit 8 is in 80-89, which is 10 pages. Similarly, 101-200: 180-189, 10 pages. 201-300: 280-289, 10 pages. 301-400: 380-389, 10 pages. Now, 401-488: the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, yes, that's 9. So total 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4 hundreds, but actually, the hundreds are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. Wait, no, 401-488 is part of the 400-499 range, but since we only go up to 488, it's not a full hundred. So, actually, the first four hundreds would be 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488 is the fifth hundred but incomplete. So, in the tens place, the first four hundreds each contribute 10 8's, and the fifth (incomplete) contributes 9. So, total 4*10 +9=49? Wait, no, wait, 1-100: 10, 101-200:10, 201-300:10, 301-400:10, and 401-488:9. So total 10+10+10+10+9=49? Wait, but that can't be right because 4*10=40 plus 9 is 49, but earlier I thought it was 39. Hmm, I'm confused.\n\nWait, let me think again. Each hundred from 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400: that's four hundreds, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, the last partial hundred, 401-488, contributes 9 8's in the tens place. So total 40+9=49. So, that's 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 39, but now I'm getting 49. Which is correct?\n\nWait, let's take an example. From 1-100: 80-89, 10 pages, so 10 8's in tens place.\n\nFrom 101-200: 180-189, 10 pages, 10 8's.\n\nFrom 201-300: 280-289, 10 pages, 10 8's.\n\nFrom 301-400: 380-389, 10 pages, 10 8's.\n\nFrom 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 pages (480,481,...,488), so 9 8's.\n\nSo, total 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 39, but that was a mistake. So, correct is 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 4 hundreds each with 10, and the last partial hundred with 9, so 4*10=40 +9=49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: how many times does 8 appear in the hundreds digit?\n\nLooking at the page numbers, the hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit 8 never appears. So, zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nWait, but wait, that can't be right because earlier when I thought the tens place was 39, I got 49+39=88, but now with tens place 49, it's 49+49=98.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: units place 8's:49, tens place 8's:49, hundreds place:0. So total 98 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. From 1-488, how many 8's in units place.\n\nEvery 10 pages, one 8. So, 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1-8, so 8 appears once more, at 488. So, total 48+1=49. That's correct.\n\nTens place: as above, 49.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the tens place was 39, but that was a mistake. It's actually 49.\n\nSo, number of 4's:178, number of 8's:98.\n\nSo, the difference is 178-98=80.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the 4's count.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:40\n\nHundreds place:89\n\nTotal:49+40=89, 89+89=178. Correct.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:49\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:178-98=80.\n\nSo, there are 80 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just cross-verify. Maybe I can think of another way.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place for all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10)=48, plus if the remainder is >=4, add 1. Since 488 mod 10=8>=4, so 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's: floor(488/10)=48, plus if remainder >=8, add 1. 488 mod 10=8, so 48+1=49.\n\nFor tens digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100)=4, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. But wait, the last hundred is 400-488, which is 89 pages. The tens digit 4 in the tens place would be from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10. So, total 4*10=40.\n\nNumber of 8's: floor(488/100)=4, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. But the last hundred (400-488) has 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 instead of 10. So, total 4*10=40, but in the last hundred, it's 9, so total 40-10+9=39? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, each hundred before the last has 10 8's in the tens place, and the last has 9. So, total 3*10 +9=39? Wait, but earlier I thought it was 49. Hmm, now I'm confused again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the tens place can be calculated as:\n\nFor each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9, each appearing 10 times. So, for the first 400 pages (1-400), there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 8's. So, total 40+9=49.\n\nWait, but if I use the formula: number of times digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to n is:\n\nLet me think. The formula is a bit involved, but perhaps I can use it.\n\nThe formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to n is:\n\nLet n be the number, split into hundreds, tens, units.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number as ABC, where A is hundreds, B is tens, C is units.\n\nThe count for digit d in the tens place is:\n\n1. If B > d: count += (A + 1) * 10\n2. If B == d: count += (A + 1) * 10 + (C + 1)\n3. If B < d: count += (A) * 10\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to use a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, for each position, calculate how many times each digit appears.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to stick with my initial calculation.\n\nWait, earlier I thought that in the tens place, 8 appears 49 times, which included 4 full hundreds each contributing 10, and the last partial hundred contributing 9, totaling 49. But when I thought about the formula, I might have confused the count.\n\nWait, let me take a specific example. Let's count the number of 8's in the tens place from 1-488.\n\nFrom 1-100: 80-89, 10 pages, so 10 8's.\n\nFrom 101-200: 180-189, 10 pages, 10 8's.\n\nFrom 201-300: 280-289, 10 pages, 10 8's.\n\nFrom 301-400: 380-389, 10 pages, 10 8's.\n\nFrom 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 8's.\n\nSo, total 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place:\n\nFrom 1-100: 40-49, 10 pages, 10 4's.\n\nFrom 101-200: 140-149, 10 pages, 10 4's.\n\nFrom 201-300: 240-249, 10 pages, 10 4's.\n\nFrom 301-400: 340-349, 10 pages, 10 4's.\n\nFrom 401-488: 440-449, 10 pages, 10 4's.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, 10 4's.\n\nSo, total 10*5=50? Wait, but wait, 1-100:10, 101-200:10, 201-300:10, 301-400:10, 401-488:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 40. Hmm, now I'm confused.\n\nWait, no, because from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 4's. So, total 5 sets, each 10, so 50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 40. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let's list them:\n\n1-100:40-49:10\n\n101-200:140-149:10\n\n201-300:240-249:10\n\n301-400:340-349:10\n\n401-488:440-449:10\n\nThat's 5 sets, each 10, so 50.\n\nBut wait, 488 is less than 499, but 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, so yes, 10 pages.\n\nSo, total 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 40. So, I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me check: earlier I thought 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, but actually, it's 5 sets: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, except the last one which is only up to 488, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, 10 pages.\n\nSo, total 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 40. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount.\n\nFrom 1-100:40-49:10\n\n101-200:140-149:10\n\n201-300:240-249:10\n\n301-400:340-349:10\n\n401-488:440-449:10\n\nSo, that's 5 sets, each with 10 4's in the tens place, totaling 50.\n\nSo, earlier I thought 40, but that was wrong. It's actually 50.\n\nWait, but then the total number of 4's would be units(49)+tens(50)+hundreds(89)=49+50=99+89=188.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier calculation. So, I must have made a mistake in the hundreds place as well.\n\nWait, let's check the hundreds place for 4's.\n\nFrom 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 488-400+1=89 pages, so 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 49+50=99+89=188.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought tens place was 40, leading to 178. So, I must have made a mistake in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me think again: from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place.\n\nEach hundred block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, from 1-100:10, 101-200:10, 201-300:10, 301-400:10, 401-488:10 (since 440-449 is within 401-488). So, that's 5 sets, each 10, so 50.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, tens place 4's:50.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nSimilarly, 8's: units(49)+tens(49)+hundreds(0)=98.\n\nSo, difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 80. So, now I'm getting 90.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units place for 4's.\n\nWait, units place for 4's: from 1-488, how many 4's in units place.\n\nEvery 10 pages, one 4. So, 488/10=48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once more (at 484). So, total 48+1=49.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nSimilarly, units place for 8's:49.\n\nTens place for 4's:50.\n\nTens place for 8's:49.\n\nHundreds place for 4's:89.\n\nHundreds place for 8's:0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 80. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the tens place for 4's. Let me recount.\n\nFrom 1-100:40-49:10\n\n101-200:140-149:10\n\n201-300:240-249:10\n\n301-400:340-349:10\n\n401-488:440-449:10\n\nThat's 5 sets, each 10, so 50.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\n8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:90.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused because earlier I thought 4's were 178, but that was because I mistakenly thought the tens place was 40 instead of 50.\n\nSo, correct total is 188-98=90.\n\nBut wait, let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 pages, so 89 4's.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, final answer:90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 80, but now I'm getting 90. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the tens place for 4's. Let me think differently.\n\nLet me write a small program or use a formula to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each position.\n\nThe formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to n is:\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number as ABC (hundreds, tens, units).\n\nThe count is:\n\ncount = (A + 1) * 10 if B > d\n\ncount = (A + 1) * 10 + (C + 1) if B == d\n\ncount = A * 10 if B < d\n\nSimilarly, for the units place, it's:\n\ncount = (n + 1) // 10 * 1 if d != 0\n\ncount = (n + 1) // 10 if d == 0\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to use a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, for the tens place:\n\nFor each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9, each appearing 10 times. So, for the first 400 pages, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit is from 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 4's.\n\nSimilarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place:4*10 +10=50.\n\n8's in tens place:4*10 +9=49.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, total 4's:49(units)+50(tens)+89(hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49(units)+49(tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 80, but now it's 90. So, I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears, then subtract the two counts to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll handle each position one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place**: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups and then 8 extra numbers. Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 fours. The extra 8 numbers (481-488) don't include a 4 in the units place, so no additional fours here. So, units place gives me 48 fours.\n\n2. **Tens place**: Now, looking at the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers, specifically from 40-49 in each hundred. Each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there in 488? Well, there are four full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 88 more pages (400-488). In each full hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so that's 4 hundreds times 10 fours, which is 40 fours. Now, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 4 for the numbers 440-449, which is 10 more fours. So, total fours in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. How many numbers are there here? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, contributing 89 fours.\n\nAdding them all up for 4: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187 fours.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8:\n\n1. **Units place**: Similar to 4, in the units place, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights. The last partial group is 481-488, which includes 488, so the units digit is 8 once here. So, units place gives 48 + 1 = 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place**: In the tens place, 8 appears in blocks like 80-89 in each hundred. Each block contributes 10 eights. There are four full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 eights, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 eights. Now, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488). Wait, 480 is included, so from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, so that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in tens place are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights here.\n\nAdding them up for 8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFor the 4's:\n- Units: 48 (since 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and 488 doesn't add another 4 in units)\n- Tens: 4 full hundreds *10=40, plus in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10, so 50\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours\nTotal: 48+50+89=187\n\nFor the 8's:\n- Units: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, plus 488 adds another 8, so 49\n- Tens: 4 full hundreds *10=40, plus in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49+49=98\n\nDifference: 187 -98=89\n\nYes, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (once every 10 numbers, 488 / 10 = 48.8).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (40 in the first four hundreds, and 10 in 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (48 from full tens, plus one in 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (40 from full hundreds, plus 9 in 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles through 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once, and so does the digit 8. How many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). In each of these 48 blocks, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place, so that's 48 times each. Now, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, they are equal.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit goes from 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89). Now, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each of the 4 complete hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4*10=40 times. Similarly, 8 appears 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Let's check how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, 488 is only up to 488, so 440-449 is within that range. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place here. Similarly, 8 in the tens place would be 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times. Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), but the tens digit is 8 for all, so that's 9 times. Wait, but 480 is included, so from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, so that's 9 times. Wait, but 480 is part of the 401-488 range, so yes, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in this partial hundred.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is 88 numbers, right? From 401 to 488 inclusive, that's 88 numbers. So, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for the tens digit 4, it's in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times. For the tens digit 8, it's from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 4 complete hundreds *10=40, plus 10 in the partial hundred, so 40+10=50. Tens place 8's: 4 complete hundreds *10=40, plus 9 in the partial hundred, so 40+9=49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, but since we're only considering page numbers starting at 1, maybe I should adjust. Wait, page numbers are 1-488, so the hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 times.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the total number of 4's and 8's across all digit places.\n\nTotal 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract 8's from 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, units place: 488 pages.\n\nNumber of complete tens: 48 (since 48*10=480). Each contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Then, from 481-488, units digits go from 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units 4's: 48 +1=49, units 8's: 48 +1=49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place. 4 hundreds, so 40 each. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8.\n\nFor 4 in the tens place: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place: 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens 4's: 40 +10=50, tens 8's: 40 +9=49. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so 0.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 +50 +89= 188.\n\n8's: 49 +49 +0=98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the tens place for the partial hundred? From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit, how many times does it appear? For example, tens digit 0: 401-410, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, tens digit 1: 411-420, etc., up to tens digit 8: 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page.\n\nSo, in the tens place for 401-488:\n\n- Tens digit 4: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n- Tens digit 8: 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to check: total numbers in 401-488 is 88. Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears how many times?\n\nFor tens digits 0-7: each appears 10 times because 401-488 includes 401-410 (tens 0), 411-420 (tens 1), ..., 471-480 (tens 7). Each of these is 10 numbers. So, 8 tens digits (0-7) each appearing 10 times, that's 8*10=80 numbers. Then, tens digit 8: 481-490, but wait, our book ends at 488, so 481-488 is 8 numbers, but wait, 480 is included as the start of the tens 8? Wait, 480 is in 480-488, so 480 is included, making it 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488.\n\nWait, so maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits:\n\n- 0: 401-410 (10 numbers)\n- 1: 411-420 (10)\n- 2: 421-430 (10)\n- 3: 431-440 (10)\n- 4: 441-450 (10)\n- 5: 451-460 (10)\n- 6: 461-470 (10)\n- 7: 471-480 (10)\n- 8: 481-488 (8 numbers, but wait, 480 is part of the previous tens digit 7? Wait, no, 480 is in the 480-488 range, which is tens digit 8, but 480 is included as the first number in that range.\n\nWait, so 480 is included in the tens digit 8, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488). So, that's 9 numbers, so tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, and 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, yes, the earlier calculation was correct: tens 4's: 10, tens 8's:9.\n\nSo, total tens 4's:40+10=50, tens 8's:40+9=49.\n\nSo, the total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I was counting the units place, I considered 488 pages, so 488 numbers. Each digit place is considered separately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a different approach to verify.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is given by:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: floor(N/10). Each group contributes one occurrence of each digit. Then, check the remainder: N mod 10. If the remainder is >=d, add 1.\n\nSo, for units place:\n\nFor 4: floor(488/10)=48, remainder=8. Since 8 >=4, add 1. So, total 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly for 8: floor(488/10)=48, remainder=8. Since 8>=8, add 1. So, 48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach digit appears 10 times per hundred. So, number of complete hundreds: floor(488/100)=4, each contributing 10 occurrences. Then, the remainder is 488 - 4*100=88.\n\nIn the remainder, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. For each digit d, the number of times it appears in the tens place in the remainder is:\n\nIf the remainder is >=10*(d+1), then it's 10 times. Otherwise, it's (remainder - 10*d +1) if d is <= (remainder)/10.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to think that in the remainder (88), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for d=4, how many times does it appear? From 40 to 49 in the tens place within 401-488. Wait, but 401-488, the tens digits go up to 8. So, for d=4 in tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total for tens place:\n\n4: 4*10 +10=50.\n\n8:4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\n8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, same as before: total 4's=49+50+89=188, total 8's=49+49+0=98. Difference=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers from 1 to 488.**\n\n2. **Units Place:**\n   - For each digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place up to N is calculated by:\n     - Number of complete groups of 10: floor(N/10).\n     - Add 1 if the remainder (N mod 10) is \u2265 d.\n   - For 4: floor(488/10) = 48, remainder = 8. Since 8 \u2265 4, add 1. Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - For 8: floor(488/10) = 48, remainder = 8. Since 8 \u2265 8, add 1. Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n3. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n   - Complete hundreds: floor(488/100) = 4. Each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8.\n     - Total so far: 4 * 10 = 40 for both 4 and 8.\n   - Remainder: 488 - 400 = 88. The tens digits in 401-488 go from 0 to 8.\n     - For 4 in tens place: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers.\n     - For 8 in tens place: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers.\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n4. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n   - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n5. **Summing Up:**\n   - Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n6. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me think about how the digits 4 and 8 appear in each position: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nMaybe I should handle each digit position separately. That is, count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place across all page numbers, and then sum them up for each digit. Then, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each position one by one.\n\nFirst, the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, pages 1-10 have units digits 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. Similarly, pages 11-20 have units digits 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0, and so on.\n\nNow, since the book has 488 pages, the total number of complete blocks of 10 is 48 (because 48*10=480), and then there's an extra 8 pages (481-488). So, for the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times in the units place for the complete blocks. But wait, for the incomplete block of 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once and 8 appears once in the units place of this partial block.\n\nTherefore, total number of 4's in units place: 48 (from complete blocks) +1 (from partial block) = 49.\n\nSimilarly, total number of 8's in units place: 48 (from complete blocks) +1 (from partial block) = 49.\n\nWait, but that seems like both 4 and 8 appear the same number of times in the units place. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, the partial block is 481-488, which has 8 pages. So, units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once, and 8 appears once. So, yes, both 4 and 8 get an extra count in the units place. So, units place contributes 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nNext, the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every block of 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digits go from 0 (pages 1-9) to 9 (page 90-99). So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred.\n\nBut let me think about 488 pages. So, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for 4 complete hundreds, each digit appears 4*10=40 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, beyond 400, we have 88 pages (401-488). So, let's look at the tens digits in this range. Pages 401-409: tens digit is 0 (since 401 is 4 0 1, up to 409 is 4 0 9). Then, 410-419: tens digit is 1, 420-429: tens digit is 2, 430-439: tens digit is 3, 440-449: tens digit is 4, 450-459: tens digit is 5, 460-469: tens digit is 6, 470-479: tens digit is 7, 480-488: tens digit is 8.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 pages, right? Because 480 is the first, then up to 488 is 9 pages (since 488-480+1=9). So, in the tens place, from 401-488, the digits are as follows:\n\n- 401-409: 9 pages, tens digit 0.\n- 410-419: 10 pages, tens digit 1.\n- 420-429: 10 pages, tens digit 2.\n- 430-439: 10 pages, tens digit 3.\n- 440-449: 10 pages, tens digit 4.\n- 450-459: 10 pages, tens digit 5.\n- 460-469: 10 pages, tens digit 6.\n- 470-479: 10 pages, tens digit 7.\n- 480-488: 9 pages, tens digit 8.\n\nSo, in the tens place beyond 400, the digit 0 appears 9 times, 1-7 each appear 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, for the tens place, the number of times 4 appears is 10 (from 440-449) and the number of times 8 appears is 9 (from 480-488). Additionally, in the earlier hundreds, each digit appears 40 times in the tens place. So, total for 4 in tens place: 40 (from 1-400) +10 (from 440-449) =50.\n\nTotal for 8 in tens place: 40 (from 1-400) +9 (from 480-488) =49.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check. From 1-400, each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place. Then, from 401-488, as I broke down, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place:50, 8's:49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only non-zero for page numbers 100 and above. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so it doesn't count. From 100-199, hundreds digit is 1; 200-299: 2; 300-399:3; 400-488:4.\n\nSo, how many times does each hundreds digit appear?\n\n- 1: 100 times (100-199)\n- 2: 100 times (200-299)\n- 3: 100 times (300-399)\n- 4: 89 times (400-488)\n\nWait, 400-488 is 89 pages because 488-400+1=89. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place, we're looking for how many 4's and 8's appear. Since the hundreds digit is only 1,2,3,4 in this book, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nNumber of 4's in hundreds place:89.\n\nSo, now, let me sum up the counts for each digit:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract total 8's from total 4's:188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nEach block of 10 pages has one 4 and one 8 in the units place. There are 48 complete blocks (480 pages), so 48 each. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so one 4 and one 8. So, units:48+1=49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 1-400, each digit appears 40 times in the tens place. Then, from 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total 4's in tens:40+10=50; 8's:40+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's here are 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But just to make sure, maybe I should verify the hundreds place count again. From 400-488, how many pages? 488-400+1=89 pages. Each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think about another approach to verify. Maybe count the number of 4's and 8's separately, but perhaps I missed something in the tens place.\n\nWait, in the tens place beyond 400, 480-488 is 9 pages, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place. And 440-449 is 10 pages, so 4 appears 10 times. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position using a formula.\n\nFor units digit: For any digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place from 1 to N is floor(N/10)*1 + (1 if the last digit is >=d else 0). But wait, actually, for each complete set of 10, each digit appears once. So, for N=488, units digit count for 4 is floor(488/10)=48, plus 1 if the last digit is >=4. Since 488's units digit is 8, which is >=4, so 48+1=49. Similarly for 8, same logic: floor(488/10)=48, plus 1 if last digit >=8, which it is, so 48+1=49. So that matches.\n\nFor tens digit: The formula is a bit more complex. The number of times a digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to N can be calculated by:\n\n- Let higher = N / 100\n- Let current = (N / 10) % 10\n- Let lower = N % 10\n\nIf current > d, then count += (higher + 1) * 10\nIf current == d, then count += higher * 10 + lower + 1\nIf current < d, then count += higher * 10\n\nBut maybe it's easier to think in terms of complete hundreds and then the partial.\n\nAlternatively, let me try applying this formula for d=4 and d=8 in the tens place.\n\nFor d=4 in tens place:\n\nhigher = 488 // 100 =4\ncurrent = (488 //10) %10=8%10=8\nlower=488%10=8\n\nSince current=8 >4, so count= (4+1)*10=5*10=50.\n\nWait, that's 50. Which matches my earlier count: from 1-400, 40 times, and 440-449 adds 10 more, total 50.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8 in tens place:\n\nhigher=4\ncurrent=8\nlower=8\n\nSince current=8 >=8, so count=4*10 + lower +1=40 +8 +1=49.\n\nWhich also matches my earlier count: 40 from 1-400, and 9 from 480-488, total 49.\n\nSo that confirms that in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nFor the hundreds place, using the same approach:\n\nd=4:\n\nhigher=488//1000=0\ncurrent=(488//100)%10=4\nlower=488%100=88\n\nSince current=4 >=4, count=0*100 + lower +1=0 +88 +1=89.\n\nWhich is correct, as 400-488 is 89 pages.\n\nFor d=8 in hundreds place:\n\ncurrent=4 <8, so count=higher*100=0*100=0.\n\nWhich is correct, as 800-899 would be required for 8 in hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488.\n\nSo, all counts seem correct.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place for the first 480 pages.\n   - Pages 481-488 add one more 4 and one more 8.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 40 times in the tens place for the first 400 pages.\n   - Pages 401-488 contribute 10 more 4's (440-449) and 9 more 8's (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (pages 400-488).\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{90}."
