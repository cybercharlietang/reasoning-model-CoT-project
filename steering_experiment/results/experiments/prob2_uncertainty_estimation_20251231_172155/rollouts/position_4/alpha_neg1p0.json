    "text": " \n\nI guess I'll need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\nStarting with the units place: The 4's in the units place occur every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many times does this happen? Well, every set of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So I can calculate how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488. \n\n488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4. So that's 48 times. But wait, the last set is from 481 to 490, but since the book only goes up to 488, does that affect the count? Let me check: 488 is the last page, so the units digit 4 would occur in 484, 494, but wait, 494 is beyond 488, so actually, in the last set, the 4 in the units place occurs only once at 484. So maybe I need to adjust that. Hmm, perhaps it's better to calculate the number of 4's in the units place as the floor division of 488 by 10, which is 48, and then check if the last number is beyond 488. Since 48*10=480, the next 4 in units place would be 484, which is within 488, so that's correct. So units place 4's: 48.\n\nNext, the tens place: The 4's in the tens place occur every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are.\n\nFrom 1-488, the ranges are:\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's. So 5*10=50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's correct. So tens place 4's: 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The 4's in the hundreds place occur from page 400 to 488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48+50=98, then 98+89=187. So 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place: Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many 8's in units place? It's the same as 4's, which is 48. But wait, let me check the last set. The last page is 488, so the units digit 8 occurs at 488, which is within the range. So 48 times.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so when I do 488 divided by 10, it's 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. So units place 8's: 48.\n\nNext, the tens place: 8's in the tens place occur in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many full ranges there are.\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo that's 4 full ranges contributing 10 each, and the last one contributing 9. So total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check if 480-488 is correct. From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So yes, 9 8's in the tens place there.\n\nSo tens place 8's: 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The 8's in the hundreds place would occur from 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. Units:48, tens:49, hundreds:0. So 48+49=97.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:48+50=98, 98+89=187\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units:48\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:48+49=97\n\nDifference:187-97=90.\n\nHmm, that seems right. I think I did it correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Count the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** Every 10 numbers, so 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 times.\n   - **Tens place:** Ranges are 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 \u2192 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n2. **Count the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to 4's \u2192 48 times.\n   - **Tens place:** Ranges are 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last range being 480-488 (9 numbers). Total: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No pages in 800s \u2192 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the approach here is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place, tens place, and hundreds place separately for both digits. I think this will help me avoid missing any numbers.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does this happen? Well, every 10 pages, like 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let me calculate how many such numbers there are. The last number with 4 in the units place is 484, which is 480 + 4. So, 484 divided by 10 gives me 48.4, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, I think it's 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within that range. So, 48 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the digit 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically from 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? Since the book goes up to 488, the blocks would be 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. Let's see, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding these up: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, moving on to the digit 8:\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, I think it's 49 times. Wait, no, because 8, 18, ..., 488 is 488/10 = 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is the 49th occurrence. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. The numbers go from 1 to 488, so the units digit cycles every 10. The number of times 8 appears in the units place is the number of complete decades (10s) plus any extra. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, each decade contributes one 8, so 48 times, and since the remainder is 8, there's an extra 8 in the units place. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers from 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Each full block (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.) contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks are there? From 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks, but the last one only goes up to 488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, for the first four blocks, each contributes 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last block contributes 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, the digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding these up: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 times the digit 8 appears.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n\n- Units: 48 times. Let me confirm: from 4,14,...,484. 484 is 48*10 +4, so yes, 48 times.\n- Tens: 5 blocks (40-49, etc.), each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That seems right.\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 48+50+89=187. That looks good.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n\n- Units: 48 full decades (1-480) contribute 48 eights, and then 488 adds one more, so 49. Correct.\n- Tens: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n- Hundreds: 0, as there are no pages beyond 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For example, in the units place for 8, does 488 count as an extra? Yes, because 480-488 includes 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Similarly, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nI think my calculations are accurate. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, ..., 484 \u2192 48 times.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " \n\nI remember that to count the number of times a specific digit appears, like 4 or 8, I should look at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. So, I'll need to calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place, and then sum them up for each digit.\n\nLet me start by figuring out how many times 4 appears in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place: The numbers go from 1 to 488. For every block of 10 numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, how many such blocks are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, I think it's 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That would give 48 times. But wait, in the last partial block from 481 to 488, the units digit goes up to 8, so 484 would be the last number where the units digit is 4. So, that's an additional 4, making it 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place: Similarly, for every block of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block from 401-488. In each full block, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the partial block from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for numbers 401-410, which is 10 numbers. So, adding that, we have 40 + 10 = 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNext, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up the counts for each place: Units (49) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me do that math: 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times in total.\n\nNow, I'll do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, for every block of 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. There are 48 full blocks (since 488 / 10 = 48.8), so 48 times. Then, in the partial block 481-488, the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included, which means one more 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nMoving to the tens place: Again, for every block of 100, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers. So, 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) each contribute 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40. In the partial block 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for numbers 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, no, that's not right. The tens digit is 8 starting at 480, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, but actually, the tens digit is 8 from 480 to 489, but since our book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, it's 40 (from full blocks) + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but hold on, in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only from 480 onwards, right? So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, the digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the counts for each place: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nWait, that seems off because earlier for 4's, we had 188, and 8's as 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations, especially for the tens place of 8's. So, in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is the first number where the tens digit is 8, and it goes up to 488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488). So, that's 9 times. So, in the tens place, 40 + 9 = 49, which is correct.\n\nWait, but earlier, for 4's in the tens place, I had 50 times. Let me check that again. For 4's in the tens place, in each full block of 100, it's 10 times, so 4 blocks give 40. Then, in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit is 4 from 400-409, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 400-409 is part of the 401-488 range. So, that's correct, 10 numbers, so 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSo, 4's total is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's total is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct.\n\nAnd for 8's, since the book only goes up to 488, there's no page number starting with 8, so hundreds digit 8 doesn't appear. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, the difference is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting 4's:**\n   - **Units Place:** 48 full decades (1-480) contribute 48 \u00d7 1 = 48. The last partial decade (481-488) adds 1 more, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** 4 full centuries (1-400) contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. The partial century (401-488) adds 10 (400-409), totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** Pages 400-488 contribute 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting 8's:**\n   - **Units Place:** 48 full decades contribute 48.

The partial century (401-488) adds 9 (480-488), totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 0, as pages don't reach 800.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by counting the number of times 4 appears. I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, from 1 to 10, 4 appears once (at page 4). From 11 to 20, it appears once (at 14), and so on. Since the book has 488 pages, the number of complete groups of 10 is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8). But wait, actually, I think it's better to calculate it as the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (each group of 10) times 1, plus any extra in the incomplete group. \n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to calculate how many times each digit appears in each position. Let me structure this.\n\nFor the units place:\n- The number of times 4 appears is equal to the number of complete sets of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, in each set of 10, 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, in the last partial set (481 to 488), the units digits go up to 8, so 484 would be the last page with a 4 in the units place. So that's one more time. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, no, actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490), but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 481-488. So in each full decade, 4 appears once in the units place, so 48 times. Then in the last partial decade (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is included, so that's one more 4. So total units 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but actually, 488 is the last page, so the last set is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So in the units place, 484 is the only one with a 4, so that's one more. So units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 540-549 would be beyond 488, so we don't need to consider that.\n\nSo how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9, so in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). So for 488 pages, we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488.\n\nWait, actually, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, for each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. But wait, in the hundreds place, when we reach 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, but we're considering the tens place here.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, 4 appears in 400-488, but that's a separate consideration. Let me stick to the tens place.\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So from 1-100, 40-49: 10 times. From 101-200, 140-149: 10 times. Similarly, 240-249: 10 times, and 340-349: 10 times. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 would be in 440-449, which is another 10 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10 times. So total tens place 4's: 5 sets of 10, so 50 times.\n\nWait, but 488 is less than 500, so from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 times. So total tens place 4's: 4 sets of 10 (from 1-400) plus 10 from 401-488, so 4*10 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digit 4 in 400-488 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's correct, 50 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers, so that's 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So 4 appears 188 times.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. So, I need to count how many times 8 appears in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, for each group of 10, 8 appears once in the units place. So from 1-10, 8 appears once (at 8). From 11-20, once (18), etc. So up to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nNumber of complete decades: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Now, in the last partial decade (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which is an 8. So that's one more. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so yes, that's correct. So units place 8's: 49.\n\nNow, tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is within the book's pages, so we need to count how many times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So from 1-100, 80-89: 10 times. From 101-200, 180-189: 10 times. From 201-300, 280-289: 10 times. From 301-400, 380-389: 10 times. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in 480-488.\n\nSo total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (from 1-400) plus 9 from 401-488. So 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me confirm: from 1-400, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so 4 hundreds would have 4*10 = 40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, the hundreds place 8's count is zero.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, so 4's appear 188 times and 8's appear 98 times. So the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full decades (each contributing 1) plus 1 in the last partial decade (484), so 49.\n- Tens place: 5 sets of 10 (from 1-400, each hundred contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus 10 from 440-449, making it 50).\n- Hundreds place: 89 times (from 400-488).\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full decades plus 1 in the last partial decade (488), so 49.\n- Tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 1-400, each contributing 10, so 40) plus 9 from 480-488, making it 49.\n- Hundreds place: 0.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Each group of 10 numbers contributes 1 occurrence of 4.\n   - There are 48 full groups of 10 (480 numbers), contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - The last 8 numbers (481-488) include 484, adding 1 more.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences (e.g., 40-49).\n   - There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - The 401-488 range includes 440-449, adding another 10.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, 48 full groups contribute 48, plus 488 adds 1.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - 4 full hundreds contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - The 401-488 range includes 480-488, contributing 9.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI remember that to count the number of times a specific digit appears, I can look at each digit place separately\u2014the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place. So, I'll need to calculate how many 4's appear in each place and do the same for 8's, then find the difference between the total number of 4's and 8's.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in a sequence of numbers. Since the book has 488 pages, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups and an extra 8 numbers. \n\nIn each complete group of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does the digit 8. So, for 48 complete groups, that's 48 times 1, which is 48 for both 4's and 8's in the units place. Now, what about the extra 8 numbers? Those would be from 481 to 488. In the units place, the digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, adding that, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's, 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, 4's and 8's are equal.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, from 1 to 488, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so that's 10 times per hundred. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 for both 4's and 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0 to 9 again. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. The tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but we only go up to 488). So, in the 400s, the tens digit for 401-488 is from 0 to 8. \n\nLooking for 4 in the tens place: that would be 440-449, but wait, our range is up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488. That's 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place here. Similarly, for 8 in the tens place, it's 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the remaining 88 pages.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit, the number of times it appears is 10, except for the last one if the total doesn't complete a full cycle. So, for 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For 8 in the tens place, it's 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the remaining 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nAdding that to the earlier 40 times each from the complete hundreds, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's is 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I made a mistake here. Because from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times, except for the last one, which might not. Wait, actually, 401-488 is 88 numbers, which is 8 full tens (0-7) and then 8 numbers in the 8th ten. So, each tens digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times. Hmm, so maybe I was wrong earlier.\n\nWait, let me clarify: from 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0\n- 411-420: tens digit 1\n- 421-430: tens digit 2\n- 431-440: tens digit 3\n- 441-450: tens digit 4\n- 451-460: tens digit 5\n- 461-470: tens digit 6\n- 471-480: tens digit 7\n- 481-488: tens digit 8\n\nWait, but 480 is included in the 471-480 range, so 480 is part of the 7's tens digit. Then 481-488 is the 8's tens digit, which is 8 numbers. So, in this case, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 numbers. The tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers.\n\nSo, in the remaining 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 8 times. Therefore, the total for the tens place is:\n\n- 4's: 40 (from the hundreds) + 10 = 50\n- 8's: 40 (from the hundreds) + 8 = 48\n\nWait, that's different from my initial thought. So, 4's in tens place: 50, 8's: 48.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case because the book goes up to 488. Let's see how many times each digit appears in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, but since we're starting from 1, maybe it's better to consider 1-99 as having no hundreds digit, but when we get to 100, the hundreds digit becomes 1. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so no 4's or 8's there. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's. From 200-299, hundreds digit is 2, so again, no 4's or 8's. From 300-399, hundreds digit is 3, so no 4's or 8's. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book doesn't go beyond 488. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, adding that up, the hundreds place contributes 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the digits for 4's and 8's.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nWait, that can't be right. 188 - 97 = 91, which seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me go back step by step.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48 * 1 = 48. Then, in the last partial cycle (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: same calculation, 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, so 48, and in the last partial cycle, 488 is included, so 8 appears once. So total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nNow, tens place:\n\nFor 4's in tens place:\n\nFrom 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nEach hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100: 40-49 (10 numbers)\n101-200: 140-149 (10)\n201-300: 240-249 (10)\n301-400: 340-349 (10)\n401-488: 440-449 (10)\n\nWait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, total 5 sets of 10, so 5 * 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 40 + 10, but actually, each hundred contributes 10, and from 401-488, another 10, so 5 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, etc., up to 400), but wait, 400 is the end of the 300s? Wait, no, 400 is part of the 400-488 range.\n\nWait, maybe I should break it down differently. Let's see:\n\nFrom 1-488, the number of times 4 appears in the tens place is:\n\n- 40-49: 10\n- 140-149: 10\n- 240-249: 10\n- 340-349: 10\n- 440-449: 10\n\nThat's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:\n\n- 80-89: 10\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nWait, so that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So total 4*10 +9=49.\n\nSo, 4's in tens place: 50, 8's:49.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-488, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\n8's in hundreds place: since the book doesn't go beyond 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's:\n\nUnits:49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total=49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\nUnits:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total=49+49=98.\n\nWait, earlier I thought 8's in tens place was 48, but now it's 49. Let me check that again.\n\nIn the tens place for 8's:\n\nFrom 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in:\n\n- 80-89:10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo that's 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nSo, 8's in tens place:49.\n\nThus, total 8's: units 49 + tens 49=98.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, 8's:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier calculation where I thought 8's in tens place was 48, leading to 97 total. So, I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought 8's in tens place was 48. It's actually 49, so total 8's is 98.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\nWait, let me confirm all the steps again to be sure.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 4's:49, 8's:49.\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4's:50, 8's:49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's:89, 8's:0.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is 188, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90. So, the final answer is \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position\u2014units, tens, and hundreds\u2014and do the same for the digit 8. Then, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once in the units place every 10 numbers. \n\nNow, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 complete sets of 10, and then 8 extra pages (481 to 488). In each complete set, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48, and the number of 8's is also 48. But wait, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). So, adding those, the units place contributes 48 + 1 = 49 fours and 48 + 1 = 49 eights. Hmm, that's interesting, so in the units place, they are equal.\n\nNext, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49), and the digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89). But again, we have to consider the total number of pages. The book goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4, but let me see how this affects the tens place.\n\nWait, actually, for the tens place, each hundred has a full cycle of 0-9 in the tens digit. So, for each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and the same for 8. Now, how many hundreds do we have? From 1-400, that's four hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Then, from 401-488, that's another 88 pages. \n\nSo, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times. So, for the tens place, that's 4*10 = 40 fours and 4*10 = 40 eights. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in this range, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 times, and the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so from 480-488, that's 9 pages (480-488 inclusive). So, the digit 8 in the tens place appears 9 times here, while the digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449). \n\nWait, no, actually, in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page. So, in this partial hundred, the tens place contributes 10 fours and 9 eights. \n\nTherefore, adding that to the previous 40 fours and 40 eights, the total for the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 fours and 40 + 9 = 49 eights. So, in the tens place, fours are more by 1.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only present in page numbers from 100 onwards. So, pages 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit. Pages 100-488 have a hundreds digit. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. \n\nLet's count how many times each hundreds digit appears. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, appearing 100 times. Similarly, 200-299: 2 appears 100 times, 300-399: 3 appears 100 times, and 400-488: 4 appears 89 times (since 400-488 is 89 pages: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). \n\nWait, let me check that. 400 to 488 inclusive is 89 pages because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. \n\nNow, how many times does the digit 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's only in 400-488, which is 89 times. How about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit can't be 8 because the book ends at 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, the digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, in the hundreds place, fours appear 89 times, and eights appear 0 times.\n\nPutting it all together now. Let's sum up the number of fours and eights in each place.\n\nStarting with fours:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal fours = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nNow, eights:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal eights = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, subtracting the total eights from the total fours: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: For 488 pages, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is (488 // 10) + (1 if 488 % 10 >= 4 else 0). Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, and then the remainder is 8. So, in the units place, the number of 4's is 48 + 1 (since 484 is within 481-488). Similarly, 8's in units place is 48 + 1 (488). So, 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. There are four full hundreds (1-400), so 4*10=40 fours and 4*10=40 eights. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, 4 in the tens place occurs from 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 times. So, adding 10 fours and 9 eights. So, total fours in tens place: 40 +10=50, eights:40+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours and 0 eights. That's correct.\n\nAdding them up: fours =49+50+89=188, eights=49+49+0=98. The difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a large number. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or another method to count the digits. For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times each digit appears.\n\nStarting with units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: For each 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, total number of 4's in units place is floor(488 / 10) + (1 if 488 % 10 >=4 else 0). So, floor(488/10)=48, and 488%10=8, which is >=4, so 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in units place: floor(488/10)=48, and 488%10=8, so 48+1=49.\n\nTens digit:\n\nNumber of 4's in tens place: For each 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49). So, total number is floor(488 / 100)*10 + extra.\n\nfloor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40. Now, check the last partial hundred: 400-488. The tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so add 10. So, total 40+10=50.\n\nNumber of 8's in tens place: Similarly, floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40. In the last partial hundred, 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, add 9. So, total 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nNumber of 8's: None, since the book ends at 488, so hundreds digit never reaches 8.\n\nSo, total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires comparing the number of times the digit '4' appears to the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each set of 10 numbers contributes one '4' and one '8'.\n   - There are 48 complete sets (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n   - In the extra pages, '4' appears once (484) and '8' appears once (488).\n   - Total '4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total '8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 '4's and 10 '8's in the tens place.\n   - Four full hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 '4's and 40 '8's.\n   - In 401-488, '4' appears 10 times (440-449), and '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total '4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total '8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - '4' appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - '8' never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total '4's: 89.\n   - Total '8's: 0.\n\n**Total Counts**:\n- '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference**: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I'll start by looking at how often the digits 4 and 8 appear in each position: units, tens, and hundreds. Maybe I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position and then sum them up for all positions.\n\nLet's start with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each set of ten numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten do we have? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). \n\nIn each complete set of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does the digit 8. So, for 48 complete sets, that's 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once (484), and the digit 8 appears once (488). \n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so the units digits go up to 8. So, in the units place, the 4 appears 48 times plus 1 more (from 484), totaling 49 times. The 8 appears 48 times plus 1 more (from 488), totaling 49 times. Hmm, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. That means they're equal here, so no difference yet.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, for each hundred, the digits 0-9 appear in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers each. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete hundreds do we have? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, we have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488.\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (40-49, 140-149, etc.), so that's 10 times per hundred. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (80-89, 180-189, etc.), also 10 times per hundred. \n\nSince there are 4 complete hundreds, the digit 4 appears 4 * 10 = 40 times in the tens place. Similarly, the digit 8 also appears 40 times in the tens place. \n\nNow, let's look at the incomplete hundred from 401-488. The tens digit here goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digits in this range are 0 (for 401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-488). \n\nLooking for when the tens digit is 4: that would be 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So, that's 10 numbers: 440-449. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place here. \n\nWhat about 8 in the tens place? That would be 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the incomplete hundred.\n\nSo, adding that up: for the tens place, 4 appears 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50 times. 8 appears 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49 times. \n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times. That means 4 appears once more in the tens place than 8.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. \n\nLet's count how often 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place. \n\nThe hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit cycles every 1000, and since our book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digits go up to 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place here. Therefore, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. That's a significant difference.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences for each digit across all places.\n\nStarting with 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nNow for 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal for 8: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's are printed, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nEach set of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8. There are 48 complete sets (1-480) and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In the extra numbers, 484 has a 4 and 488 has an 8. So, units place: 48 +1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. For 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, 440-449 is 10 numbers, contributing 10 4's, and 480-488 is 9 numbers, contributing 9 8's. So, tens place: 4 appears 40 +10=50, 8 appears 40 +9=49. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n400-488 is 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so 0. That's correct.\n\nSo, total for 4: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal for 8: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98 =90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 90 more 4's than 8's are printed.\n\nI think that makes sense because the hundreds place contributes a lot more 4's than 8's, which skews the total in favor of 4. So, the final answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears equally in the units place every 10 numbers.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 pages, contributing 48 occurrences each for 4 and 8.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add 1 more occurrence for both 4 and 8.\n   - **Total in units place:** 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers.\n   - There are 4 complete sets of 100 pages, contributing 40 occurrences each for 4 and 8.\n   - In the incomplete set (401-488), 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - **Total in tens place:** 50 for 4 and 49 for 8.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences for 4.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place in this range.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89 for 4 and 0 for 8.\n\n**Summing Up:**\n- **Total occurrences of 4:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- **Total occurrences of 8:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the best way to approach this is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately.\n\nFirst, the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1 through 0. From 11 to 20, it's 1 through 0 again, and so on. Since the book goes up to 488, I need to figure out how many complete groups of 10 there are and then handle any remaining pages.\n\nSo, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10, and then 8 extra pages (since 48*10 = 480, and 488 - 480 = 8). \n\nIn each group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for the digit 8. So, in 48 complete groups, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, and the same for 8's. Now, I need to check the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488). The units digits here are 1 through 8. So, in these remaining pages, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). \n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 48 (from complete groups) + 1 (from remaining) = 49.\nTotal 8's in units place: 48 (from complete groups) + 1 (from remaining) = 49.\n\nWait, that seems equal, but let me double-check. From 1 to 480, each digit 4 and 8 appears 48 times in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1-8, so 484 has a 4, and 488 has an 8. So yes, each gets one more, making it 49 each. So, the units place contributes equally to both 4's and 8's.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit changes every 10 pages. For example, from 1-9, the tens digit is 0, but since we're starting from page 1, maybe it's better to think of it as 1-9 having no tens digit, but from 10 onwards, the tens digit becomes 1, then 2, etc.\n\nWait, actually, page numbers from 1 to 9 are single-digit, so their tens digit doesn't exist. So, the tens digit starts from page 10. So, the tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each cycle of 100 pages has 10 occurrences of each tens digit. For example, from 10-19, the tens digit is 1; 20-29, it's 2; and so on up to 90-99, where it's 9. Each of these groups contributes 10 times the tens digit.\n\nBut since our book goes up to 488, let's see how many complete hundreds we have. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages in the incomplete fifth hundred (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. Wait, no, actually, in each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9, each appearing 10 times in the tens place. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\nSo, in each complete hundred, the number of 4's in the tens place is 10, and the same for 8's. Since there are 4 complete hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 for each digit.\n\nNow, let's look at the incomplete fifth hundred, which is from 401 to 488. The tens digits here go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, let's break this down:\n\n- Pages 401-410: Tens digit is 0 (401-410). So, no 4's or 8's in the tens place here.\n- Pages 411-420: Tens digit is 1. No 4's or 8's.\n- Pages 421-430: Tens digit is 2. No 4's or 8's.\n- Pages 431-440: Tens digit is 3. No 4's or 8's.\n- Pages 441-450: Tens digit is 4. So, here, the tens digit is 4 for pages 441-450. That's 10 pages, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n- Pages 451-460: Tens digit is 5. No 4's or 8's.\n- Pages 461-470: Tens digit is 6. No 4's or 8's.\n- Pages 471-480: Tens digit is 7. No 4's or 8's.\n- Pages 481-488: Tens digit is 8. So, here, the tens digit is 8 for pages 481-488. That's 8 pages, so 8 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but from 481 to 488, the tens digit is 8, so that's 8 times, right? Because 488 is the last page, so it's pages 481-488, which is 8 pages: 481, 482, ..., 488. So, 8 times the tens digit 8.\n\nSo, in the incomplete fifth hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and the tens digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from incomplete) = 50.\nTotal 8's in the tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 8 (from incomplete) = 48.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me check again. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40 each. Then, from 401-488, the 4's in the tens place occur in 441-450, which is 10 times, and 8's occur in 481-488, which is 8 times. So, yes, 40+10=50 for 4's, and 40+8=48 for 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only present in page numbers from 100 onwards. So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 1-99, there's no hundreds digit. From 100-488, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n- Pages 100-199: Hundreds digit is 1. So, no 4's or 8's here.\n- Pages 200-299: Hundreds digit is 2. No 4's or 8's.\n- Pages 300-399: Hundreds digit is 3. No 4's or 8's.\n- Pages 400-488: Hundreds digit is 4. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in the range up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, because the next hundred after 400 is 500, which is beyond 488. So, the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place in this book. So, total 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\nTotal 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences for each digit.\n\nFor digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = Let's calculate: 49 + 50 = 99, then +89 = 188.\n\nFor digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n- Each group of 10 has one 4 and one 8.\n- 488 pages mean 48 full groups (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n- So, 48*1 = 48 for each digit, plus in the remaining 8 pages, 484 adds a 4 and 488 adds an 8. So, units place: 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each complete hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.) contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n- 4 complete hundreds: 4*10=40 each.\n- In the incomplete hundred (401-488), 441-450 contributes 10 4's, and 481-488 contributes 8 8's.\n- So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 8 = 48 for 8's. That adds up.\n\nHundreds place:\n- From 400-488, hundreds digit is 4, so 89 times.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so 0.

After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each place one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4. \n\nFirst, the units place. For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1 to 10, it's 4; from 11 to 20, it's 14, and so on. So, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. In each of the 48 full groups, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial group, which is from 481 to 488, the units digit goes up to 8, so the 4 in the units place is at 484. That's one more. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. For the tens digit, every group of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of a particular digit in the tens place. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, from 101 to 200, it's 140-149, another 10. So, how many full hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, the last partial hundred is from 401 to 488. In this range, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's another 10. So total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4's appear 188 times.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4's, every group of 10 has one 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many full groups of 10 are there? 48 full groups (since 488 / 10 = 48.8). Each contributes one 8, so 48. Then, the last partial group is 481-488, which includes 488. So, in the units place, 8 appears once more. So total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. For the tens digit, every group of 100 has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full hundreds in 488, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so 9 occurrences. So total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full groups of 10 and one partial group (481-488), totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times in each hundred. With four full hundreds and one partial hundred (401-488), totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. With 48 full groups and one partial group, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears 10 times in each hundred. With four full hundreds and nine occurrences in the partial hundred (480-488), totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 never appears as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the different positions where digits can appear: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll handle each digit position separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place**: The 4 appears every 10 numbers, right? So from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, I can calculate the total number by dividing 488 by 10. Let me do that: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does the last block (481-490) have a 488? Yes, so actually, the units digit 4 appears 48 times. Hmm, but wait, 488 is included, so maybe I should check if 488 is beyond 480, which it is, so 488 is part of the 481-490 block, but since 490 is beyond 488, the last 4 in the units place is at 484. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 \u00f7 10 is 48.8, so actually, there are 48 full tens and then a partial. But the partial would be 8 pages (481-488), so in that partial block, the units digit 4 appears once at 484. So total units digit 4's would be 48 (from 1-480) plus 1 (from 481-488), totaling 49. Wait, no, because 480 \u00f7 10 is 48, so 48 times, and then in 481-488, 484 is the only one, so total 49. Hmm, but I'm not sure if I'm overcounting. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of times 4,14,24,...,484 appear. The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. To find how many terms are there, I can use the formula: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So yes, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place**: Now, the digit 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the blocks are:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nBut wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but let me check: 440-449 is 10 numbers, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. The first block is 40-49: 10 numbers, then 140-149: another 10, and so on up to 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each with 10, so 50. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, actually, each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since our book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place**: Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many terms are there. The sequence starts at 8 and ends at 488. The common difference is 10, so the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place**: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, let's count:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nSo, total in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=40+9=49 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, yes, 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 +0=98 times.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the hundreds place for 4 was 89, but let me confirm. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place of 4, we had 5 blocks: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each contributes 10, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place, we had 4 full blocks (80-89, etc.) and one partial block (480-488), which is 9 numbers, so 4*10+9=49. Correct.\n\nUnits place for both digits: 49 each, which seems right.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None (since pages go up to 488) \u2192 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 more times than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Units place: The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, like 4,14,24,... up to 484. So I can calculate how many full groups of 10 there are in 488 and then see if there's a partial group. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups and then 8 extra numbers. In each full group, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So that's 48 times. Now, the extra 8 numbers would be from 481 to 488, and in these, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So total 4's in units place are 48.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 in each set of 10 numbers. So for example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, from 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10 times, and so on. So how many hundreds do we have? 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. In each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So that's 4*10=40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490. But since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers. However, we're looking for the digit 4 in the tens place. So in 401-488, the tens digit is 0 in 401-410, 1 in 411-420, etc. Wait, actually, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, 2 for 421-430, 3 for 431-440, 4 for 441-450, and then 5-8 for the remaining. So the digit 4 in the tens place occurs in 441-450, which is 10 times. But wait, 488 is less than 490, so 441-450 is entirely within 401-488? Wait, 450 is less than 488, so yes, 441-450 is 10 numbers, so that's 10 more 4's in the tens place. So total for tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 (from last partial hundred) = 50 times.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So the hundreds digit is 4 in all these 89 numbers, so that's 89 times.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So 187 4's.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. Units place: Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48 times. The extra 8 numbers are 481-488, where the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in the units place (at 488). So total units place 8's: 48 +1=49.\n\n2. Tens place: For the tens digit, it's similar. Each hundred has a set where the tens digit is 8, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So in each hundred, that's 10 times. How many full hundreds do we have? 4 full hundreds, so 4*10=40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but 480 is part of 401-488, right? So in the tens place, 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is included). So that's 9 times. So total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nNow, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal: 187\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:98\n\nDifference: 187-98=89.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 89 more 4's.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

Well, every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the number of 4's in the units place would be the total number of blocks of 10 in 488 pages. Let me calculate that: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, it's 48 full blocks. Each block contributes one 4, so that's 48 times. But wait, the last block goes up to 488, which is 488, so actually, the 48th block ends at 480, and then we have 481 to 488. So, in the units place, from 1 to 480, there are 48 fours, and then from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no additional 4's. So, total units place 4's: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place**: Now, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, right? For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds. Each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, the last partial hundred is from 400 to 488. In this range, the tens digit is 4 for pages 400-409, which is 10 numbers. So, adding that, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's: 187.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place**: Similar to the 4's, every block of 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go up to 8, so that's one more 8 (page 488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place**: For the tens digit, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, 4 full hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, 480 is 480, 481, ..., up to 488. That's 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is the start, and 488 is the end, so 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is from 800 onwards. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. That also seems correct.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but when calculating the tens place for 8's, I thought from 480-488, the tens digit is 8. Let me confirm that. The tens digit is 8 for numbers from 480 to 489, but since our book only goes up to 488, it's 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother thing to check: when calculating the units place for 8's, I added one more 8 because page 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, units place 8's: 48 (from 1-480) plus 1 (488) equals 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the units place, from 1-480, we have 48 fours, and from 481-488, no additional fours in the units place, so 48 total.\n\nFor the tens place of 4's, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 400-409. Each of these contributes 10 fours, so 5 blocks, each with 10 fours: 5*10=50. Wait, wait, earlier I thought 4 full hundreds, but actually, the hundreds go up to 400-488, so in the hundreds place, 400-488 is the fifth hundred? Wait, no, 400 is the start of the hundreds place being 4, but the tens digit being 4 occurs in each hundred block. So, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 400-409. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place of 8's, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, five blocks, but the last block only has 9 numbers. So, 4 blocks of 10, which is 40, plus 9 in the last partial block, totaling 49. That's correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct, and the difference is indeed 89.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nI remember that to count the number of times a specific digit appears, I can look at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds, etc. So, for this problem, I need to calculate how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and how many times the digit 8 appears, then find the difference between the two totals.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every group of ten numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the digits in the units place are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 also appears once. \n\nNow, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of ten and then an extra 8 pages. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times, and the digit 8 appears 48 times. But wait, in the last partial group, which is pages 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial group, the digit 4 appears once (at page 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at page 488). Therefore, the total for units place is 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. Hmm, but wait, actually, in the units place, 488 is included, so maybe I should check that again. \n\nWait, actually, let me correct that. The full groups are from 1-10, 11-20, ..., 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the last group is 481-488. So, in the units place, each full group contributes one 4 and one 8, so 48 groups give 48 each. The last partial group (481-488) has units digits 1 through 8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). Therefore, total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8. So, same number in units place.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, in each hundred, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, each hundred contributes 10 occurrences, and similarly for 8.\n\nNow, how many full hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages (401-488). So, in each of the first four hundreds, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and the digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for each hundred, 10 each, so 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 for 4, and 4*10=40 for 8.\n\nNow, the remaining pages are 401-488. Let's look at the tens place here. The tens digit in this range is 0 (for 401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? It would be in 440-449, which is 10 pages. But wait, our range only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is fully included. So, that's 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. \n\nSimilarly, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place in 401-488? It would be in 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in this range.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, 401-410: tens digit 0, 411-420: 1, ..., 481-488: 8. So, the tens digit 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 pages (481 to 488 inclusive is 8 numbers). Wait, no, 481 to 488 is 8 numbers: 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So that's 8 pages, so the digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place here.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 9. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recount. From 480-489 would be 10 pages, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 pages: 480,481,...,488. Wait, 480 is included? Wait, 401-488: does 480 fall within that? Yes, because 480 is greater than 401 and less than 488. So, 480 is included, so the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, 9 times. Wait, but 480 is the first page with tens digit 8 in this range, and 488 is the last. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 pages. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in this last partial hundred.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 480-488 is 9 pages, but when I count from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So yes, 9 times. So, in the tens place, for the last partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). \n\nSo, total in tens place: 4 appears 4*10 (from the first four hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50 times. And 8 appears 4*10 (from the first four hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so we can ignore that. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4. \n\nSo, for the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears in all page numbers from 400 to 488. Let's see how many that is. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nThe digit 8 in the hundreds place would appear in page numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, the digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each place.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal for 8: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- Each group of 10 has one 4 and one 8. There are 48 full groups (1-480), each contributing 1, so 48 each. Then, the last group 481-488 contributes one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, total units: 48 + 1 = 49 for both. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) give 40 each. Then, in 401-488, 440-449 is 10 occurrences of 4, and 480-488 is 9 occurrences of 8. So, total for 4: 40 + 10 = 50, and for 8: 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 appears 0 times. That's correct.\n\nSo, adding up:\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 90, but let me check again. Yes, 188 - 98 is indeed 90. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each group of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n- There are 48 full groups (1-480) and a partial group (481-488).\n- Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n- Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n- Four full hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 each.\n- In 401-488, 440-449 adds 10 4's, and 480-488 adds 9 8's.\n- Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n- Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n- 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nStarting with the digit 4. Let's look at each position:\n\n1. Units place: The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, there's a 4 in the units place. So from 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of 10, which would be 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so after 480, we have 481 to 488. In that range, the units digit 4 appears once (484). So total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each set of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. So from 1 to 488, how many such sets are there? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4 full sets (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but the last set is only up to 488, so the tens digit 4 in the hundreds place would go from 400-488. Let me see, in each full hundred, there are 10 numbers with tens digit 4. So 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40. But wait, in the last partial hundred, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So actually, it's 5 sets: 0-99 (40-49), 100-199 (140-149), 200-299 (240-249), 300-399 (340-349), and 400-488 (440-449). So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50.\n\nWait, did I make a mistake earlier? Because from 1-488, the hundreds go up to 4, so maybe it's 4 full hundreds? Let me think again. The first hundred (1-100) has 1 set (40-49), the second (101-200) has another set (140-149), third (201-300) has 240-249, fourth (301-400) has 340-349, and then 401-488 has 440-449. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So 5*10=50.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. Units place: Similar to 4, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1, so 48 times. But wait, from 1 to 480, that's 480 pages, so 48 sets, each 10 pages. So 48 times. Then from 481 to 488, which is 8 pages, the units digit 8 appears once (488). So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: Similar to 4, each hundred has a set where the tens digit is 8. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc. So how many sets are there? From 1-488, we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, does the tens digit 8 appear? Yes, from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481,...,488). So the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. Wait, but does 480 count as part of the tens digit 8? Let me check: 480 has tens digit 8, right? Because 480 is 4 8 0, so yes. So from 480-488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but hold on, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but in the tens place, each of these has 8 in the tens digit. So that's 9 more. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in page numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so 98 total 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place 8's were 49 and tens place 8's were 49, so 98 total. But let me check again for tens place in 401-488: from 480-488, that's 9 numbers where tens digit is 8. So 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nNow, total 4's were 188, and total 8's are 98. So how many more 4's than 8's? 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but wait a second, let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the 4's in the tens place. Earlier, I thought there were 5 sets of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. Let me confirm:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers, tens digit 4\n- 140-149: 10\n- 240-249: 10\n- 340-349: 10\n- 440-449: 10\n\nYes, that's 5 sets, so 5*10=50. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, we have:\n\n- 80-89: 10\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9\n\nSo that's 4*10 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So that's correct.\n\nSo the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10 (480 pages) plus one more in 484, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in sets like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such sets (including 440-449), each contributing 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 (48 full sets + one in 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in sets like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full sets plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 never appears as the hundreds digit.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference = 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the difference. That makes sense. So, I should probably go through each digit place separately\u2014units, tens, and hundreds\u2014and count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each place.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in the range from 1 to 488, how many times does each digit appear in the units place? Well, for 488 pages, the number of complete decades (groups of 10) is 48 (since 48*10=480), and then there are 8 extra pages (481 to 488). \n\nIn each complete decade, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for the digit 4, in each decade, it appears once. Similarly, for the digit 8, it also appears once per decade. So, in 48 decades, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, and the same for 8's. Now, looking at the last partial decade from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). Therefore, in the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's, which is 48 + 1 = 49. So, the counts for units place are equal.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, in the range from 1 to 488, how many hundreds do we have? We have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then the last partial hundred from 401 to 488.\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for each hundred, we have 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8. Since there are 4 complete hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 for both 4 and 8.\n\nNow, looking at the last partial hundred from 401 to 488. The tens digit here ranges from 0 (for 401-409) to 8 (for 480-488). So, in this range, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for the numbers 440-449, which is 10 numbers. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Therefore, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times, and the digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nAdding this to the previous counts, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50, and the total for 8's is 40 + 9 = 49. So, in the tens place, there are more 4's than 8's by 1.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, for 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, let me correct that: the hundreds digit is 1 for 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. \n\nSo, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place? The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). The digit 8, however, never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 occurrences of 4 and 0 occurrences of 8.\n\nPutting it all together, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nIn the units place, I had 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 and one 8, plus the last 8 pages contributing one 4 and one 8. That seems correct, so 49 each.\n\nIn the tens place, each full hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's, so 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), 440-449 gives 10 4's, and 480-488 gives 9 8's. So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's. That looks right.\n\nIn the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's. 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so 0. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Total 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. \n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - For 488 pages, there are 48 complete decades (1-480) and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n   - **4's:** 48 (from decades) + 1 (484) = 49.\n   - **8's:** 48 (from decades) + 1 (488) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times per hundred.\n   - For 488 pages, 4 complete hundreds (1-400) and a partial hundred (401-488).\n   - **4's:** 40 (from hundreds) + 10 (440-449) = 50.\n   - **8's:** 40 (from hundreds) + 9 (480-488) = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears from page 400 to 488, which is 89 times.\n   - The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nThe digit 4 appears 90 more times than the digit 8.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI remember that to count the number of times a particular digit appears, I can analyze each digit's place separately: the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place. Since 488 is a three-digit number, I'll need to consider all three places. \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each place one by one.\n\nFirst, the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, the digit 4 appears once in every ten numbers. Now, since the book has 488 pages, I can divide 488 by 10 to find how many complete sets of ten there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. Each of these 48 sets contributes one 4 in the units place. So, that's 48 fours. But wait, I think I might be missing something because 488 is not a multiple of 10. The last set would be from 481 to 488, so I need to check if there's an extra 4 in the units place beyond these 48 sets. Let me see, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is the only number with a 4 in the units place. So that's one more 4. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me correct that. When I divide 488 by 10, I get 48 full sets (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490), but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is actually 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, the number of complete sets is actually 48, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then in the incomplete set (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (at 484). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers. Now, how many full hundreds are there in 488? There are four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours. Now, what about the remaining pages from 401 to 488? The tens digit here cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. So, that's another 10 fours. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but from 401 to 488, the tens digit 4 would be in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, yes, adding to the previous 40 gives 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 1 for 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and then 4 again for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 300-399, that's 100 numbers, each with 4 in the hundreds place. Then from 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89), each with 4 in the hundreds place. So total hundreds place 4's: 100 + 89 = 189.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again. From 300-399: 100 numbers, each has 4 in the hundreds place. From 400-488: 89 numbers, each has 4 in the hundreds place. So, yes, 100 + 89 = 189. So, total 4's in the hundreds place: 189.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (189) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 189 is 288. So, total 4's: 288.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nUnits place: 48 full sets of 10, each contributing 1 four, so 48. Then from 481-488, 484 has a 4 in units, so 1 more, total 49. That seems right.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each giving 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 is from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, total tens place 4's: 40+10=50. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 300-399: 100 fours. From 400-488: 89 fours. So, 100+89=189. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 189 = 288.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with units place: Similar to 4's, in every set of 10, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1 eight, so 48. Then, in the last partial set from 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For 8's in the tens place, each hundred contributes 10 eights. So, 4 full hundreds (1-100, etc.) each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's from 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 480 +1 = 9 numbers. So, 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so 9 eights. So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nUnits place: 48 full sets (1-480), each contributing 1 eight, so 48. Then, 481-488: 488 has an 8 in units, so 1 more, total 49.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 eights, so 40. Then, 401-488: the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 288, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 288 - 98 = 190.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the 4's count, because 288 seems high. Let me recount:\n\n4's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full sets (1-480), each contributing 1 four, so 48. Then, 481-488: 484 has a 4 in units, so 1 more, total 49.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 fours, so 40. Then, 401-488: 440-449, which is 10 fours, so 10. Total tens place 4's: 40 +10=50.\n\nHundreds place: From 300-399: 100 fours. From 400-488: 89 fours. So, 100 +89=189.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +189=288.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full sets, 48, plus 1 in 488, total 49.\n\nTens place: 40 from full hundreds, plus 9 from 480-488, total 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 +49=98.\n\nDifference: 288 -98=190.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 190 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 288, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 288 - 98 = 190.\n\n$\\boxed{190}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should analyze the digits in each place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. For each place, I can count how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times 8 appears, then subtract the two totals to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, every 10 consecutive numbers will have one 4 and one 8. For example, from 1-10, the 4 is on page 4 and the 8 is on page 8. This pattern repeats every 10 numbers. So, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Let me calculate that. \n\nDividing 488 by 10 gives me 48 complete groups, with 8 remaining pages (since 48*10=480, and 488-480=8). Each complete group contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 groups would give 48 fours and 48 eights. Now, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) include the units digits from 1 to 8. In these, the digit 4 appears once (on page 484) and the digit 8 appears once (on page 488). So, adding that, the total for units place would be 48+1=49 fours and 48+1=49 eights. Wait, that's the same, so the difference from units place is zero.\n\nNext, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for pages 40-49 (10 times) and 8 for pages 80-89 (10 times). So, each hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. \n\nSince the book has 488 pages, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). Let's calculate the fours and eights in the tens place for each hundred:\n\n- 1-100: 10 fours (40-49) and 10 eights (80-89)\n- 101-200: 10 fours (140-149) and 10 eights (180-189)\n- 201-300: 10 fours (240-249) and 10 eights (280-289)\n- 301-400: 10 fours (340-349) and 10 eights (380-389)\n\nSo, each hundred contributes 10 of each, and there are 4 hundreds, so that's 4*10=40 fours and 4*10=40 eights.\n\nNow, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488). The tens digit here goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). Let's see how many fours and eights are in the tens place here.\n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit is 0, so no fours or eights.\n411-420: tens digit is 1, no fours or eights.\n421-430: tens digit is 2, no fours or eights.\n431-440: tens digit is 3, no fours or eights.\n441-450: tens digit is 4, so that's 10 fours (441-450). But wait, 450 is within 488, so yes, that's 10 fours.\n451-460: tens digit is 5, no fours or eights.\n461-470: tens digit is 6, no fours or eights.\n471-480: tens digit is 7, no fours or eights.\n481-488: tens digit is 8, so that's 8 eights (481-488). Wait, from 481 to 488, the tens digit is 8, so that's 8 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 481-488 is 8 pages. So, in the tens place, we have 10 fours (441-450) and 8 eights (481-488). So, adding to the previous totals:\n\nTotal fours in tens place: 40 (from the 4 hundreds) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50 fours.\nTotal eights in tens place: 40 (from the 4 hundreds) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48 eights.\n\nSo, the difference from the tens place is 50 fours minus 48 eights, which is 2 more fours.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. Wait, actually, 400-488 would have hundreds digit 4, right? So, let's see how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place and how many times 8 appears.\n\nFrom 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's.\n100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's.\n200-299: hundreds digit is 2, so no 4's or 8's.\n300-399: hundreds digit is 3, so no 4's or 8's.\n400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 pages (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, how about 8's in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can't be 8. So, 8's in the hundreds place would only occur if the book had pages beyond 800, which it doesn't. So, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nTherefore, the total fours in the hundreds place are 89, and the total eights are 0. So, the difference here is 89 fours minus 0 eights, which is 89 more fours.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each place:\n\n- Units place: 0 fours - 0 eights = 0\n- Tens place: 2 fours - 0 eights = 2\n- Hundreds place: 89 fours - 0 eights = 89\n\nWait, no, actually, I think I made a mistake here. The hundreds place difference is 89 fours and 0 eights, so the difference is 89. The tens place was 50 fours and 48 eights, so the difference is 2 fours. The units place was 49 fours and 49 eights, so difference 0.\n\nWait, but earlier in the units place, I thought it was 49 fours and 49 eights, but let me double-check that.\n\nWait, no, earlier when I calculated the units place, I had 48 groups of 10, each contributing 1 four and 1 eight, so that's 48 fours and 48 eights. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total fours in units place: 48+1=49, and eights: 48+1=49. So, units place difference is 0.\n\nTens place: fours are 50, eights are 48, so difference is 2.\n\nHundreds place: fours are 89, eights are 0, so difference is 89.\n\nSo, total difference is 0 (units) + 2 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 91 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check again because 488 is the last page. In the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, right? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place, from 400-488, we had 10 fours (441-450) and 8 eights (481-488). So, adding to the previous 40 fours and 40 eights from the first 400 pages, that gives 50 fours and 48 eights in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: 49 fours and 49 eights.\n\nSo, total fours: 89 (hundreds) + 50 (tens) + 49 (units) = 188 fours.\n\nTotal eights: 0 (hundreds) + 48 (tens) + 49 (units) = 97 eights.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 91 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each group of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 groups with 8 remaining pages.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 (from 484) = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 (from 488) = 49.\n   - Difference: 49 - 49 = 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights.\n   - 4 hundreds contribute 40 fours and 40 eights.\n   - Remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n     - 10 fours (441-450).\n     - 8 eights (481-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 8 = 48.\n   - Difference: 50 - 48 = 2.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 contribute 89 fours.\n   - No 8's in the hundreds place.\n   - Difference: 89 - 0 = 89.\n\n**Total Difference:**\n- Units: 0\n- Tens: 2\n- Hundreds: 89\n- **Total:** 0 + 2 + 89 = 91.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and then 8 more pages. \n\nIn each complete set of 10, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for 48 sets, that's 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, for the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, that's the same number. So, no difference in the units place.\n\nNext, let's move to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 1 to 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 pages: 40-49. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 pages: 80-89. So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for every 100 pages. \n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times each. Now, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 pages (440-449), and the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 pages (480-489). But wait, our range is only up to 488, so the 8's in the tens place would be from 480 to 488, which is 9 pages, not 10. \n\nWait, hold on, let me clarify. The tens digit in 401-488 is from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 4, the pages are 440-449, which is 10 pages. When the tens digit is 8, the pages are 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 9 pages (480-488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in the remaining 88 pages. \n\nTherefore, for the tens place, 4 appears 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 10 = 50 times, and 8 appears 40 + 9 = 49 times. So, the tens place gives us one more 4 than 8.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. From 1 to 99, there's no hundreds digit. From 100 to 488, the hundreds digit cycles as 1, 2, 3, and 4. \n\nFirst, let's figure out how many times each hundreds digit appears. The hundreds digit is 1 from 100-199, which is 100 pages. Similarly, 2 from 200-299 (100 pages), 3 from 300-399 (100 pages), and 4 from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). \n\nWe're interested in how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place. Well, 4 appears in the hundreds place for 89 pages (400-488). The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all because the book only goes up to 488. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place. \n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. That's a significant difference.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit across all places.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal for 8: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n- 488 pages, so 488 / 10 = 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 * 1 = 48 for each digit. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, units total is 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) contribute 4 * 10 = 40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (440-449) and 8 for 9 pages (480-488). So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8. That looks right.\n\nHundreds place:\n- Only 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAdding up:\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nIs there any other place where 8 might appear? No, because the book doesn't go beyond 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\nStarting with the units place: The digits cycle every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So I can calculate how many full groups of 10 there are in 488 and then see how many 4's that gives me.\n\nWait, actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. In each group, the units digit is 4 exactly once, so that's 48 times. But then in the last partial group (481 to 488), the units digit 4 appears once more (at 484). So total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each cycle has 10 instances where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So how many full hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 extra pages (401-488). \n\nIn each full hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for the numbers 440-449. That's another 10 times. So total tens place 4's would be 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only for the numbers from 400 to 488. So how many numbers is that? It's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So there are 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So 488 / 10 = 48.8, which means 48 full groups and 8 extra numbers. In each group, units digit 8 appears once, so 48 times. In the last partial group (481-488), units digit 8 appears once (at 488). So total units place 8's would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each cycle has 10 instances where the tens digit is 8 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 full hundreds in 488, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for the numbers 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, actually, from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for all those numbers, right? So that's 9 numbers. But wait, 480 is the first number in this range, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So that's 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred. Therefore, total tens place 8's would be 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So there are no hundreds digits of 8 in this case. So hundreds place 8's = 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So there are 98 eights in total.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. For the tens place, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo total 4's are 188, and total 8's are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. That seems right.\n\nAnd for the tens place of 4's, I had 50, which came from 4 full hundreds each contributing 10, and then the last partial hundred (401-488) contributing another 10 (440-449). So that's 4*10 + 10 = 50. That adds up.\n\nFor the units place of 4's, 49, which is 48 full groups and 1 in the last partial group. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's, units place is 49, which is 48 full groups and 1 in the last partial group. Tens place is 49, from 4 full hundreds and 9 in the last partial. So 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to miscount, especially in the last partial group. Let me recount the units place for 4's. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nWell, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups. Each group contributes 1, so 48. Then, in the last group, which is 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So 4 appears once at 484. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place, same logic: 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48, and then in the last group, 488, so 8 appears once. So 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place for 4's: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So 4 hundreds would be 40. Then, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nTens place for 8's: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So 4 hundreds would be 40. Then, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nHundreds place for 8's: 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are none. So 0.\n\nSo adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Once I have those counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4. I'll consider each position separately.\n\n1. **Units place:** The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. \n\n   Now, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and an additional 8 pages (481-488). In each of these 48 blocks, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (page 484). So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each block of 100 pages has 10 occurrences of a particular digit in the tens place. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for pages 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, from 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10 times, and so on.\n\n   Let's see how many complete hundreds we have in 488. The hundreds digit goes up to 4 (since 488 is in the 400s). So, we have four blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. \n\n   For each of the first four blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each. So that's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 times. Now, looking at the last partial block, 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the digit 4 in the tens place occurs in pages 440-449. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488. That's another 10 occurrences. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nNext, I'll do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, every block of 10 pages has one 8 in the units place. There are 48 complete blocks (480 pages) and an additional 8 pages (481-488). In each complete block, that's 48 eights, and in the last partial block, the units digit goes up to 8, so 8 appears once (page 488). So, units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** For the tens digit, each block of 100 pages has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. From 1-100, it's 80-89; from 101-200, 180-189, etc. There are four complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 eights, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial block, 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, 480-488 is where the tens digit is 8. That's 9 pages (480-488 inclusive). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 occurrences. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 full decades, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in 481-488, 484 is the only one, so 48 +1 = 49. That seems right.\n\n- Tens: Each hundred contributes 10, so 4 hundreds \u00d710=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 +10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89. So total 49+50+89=188. That adds up.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 48 full decades, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, 488 is the last page, so units digit 8 appears once more, making 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens: Each hundred contributes 10, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but 480 is included, so that's 9 numbers, but each of these has 8 in the tens place. So, 9 occurrences. So, 40 +9=49. That seems correct.\n\n- Hundreds: None, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 +49 +0=98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check again. From 1-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, each of the first four sets is 10 numbers, and the last one is 9 numbers (since 488 is the end). So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I calculated the 4's in the hundreds place, I considered 400-488 as 89 numbers, which is correct because 488-400+1=89.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct, and the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 pages. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete decades (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488). Each decade contributes 1 occurrence, so 48 \u00d7 1 = 48. In the extra pages, 484 contributes 1 more, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 pages. From 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100 pages, each contributing 10 occurrences (40 total). From 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, contributing another 10, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 8 appears once every 10 pages. From 1-488, there are 48 complete decades and 8 extra pages. Each decade contributes 1 occurrence, so 48 \u00d7 1 = 48. In the extra pages, 488 contributes 1 more, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 pages. From 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100 pages, each contributing 10 occurrences (40 total). From 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, contributing 9 occurrences, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers between 800-899, so 0 occurrences.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 times more than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Each block of 100 pages has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. So how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? \n\n488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then the last block is 401-488. Each complete block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 blocks give 4*10=40. Now, in the last block, 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for pages 401-409, 1 for 410-419, and so on up to 8 for 480-488. Wait, but the tens digit is 0 in 401-409, which is 9 pages. So the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 pages, but wait, 440-449 would be within 401-488, right? So that's another 10 4's in the tens place. So total 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Each block of 100 pages (like 1-100) has 10 4's in the tens place (40-49). So 4 blocks would be 4*10=40. Then, in the 401-488 block, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so that's another 10. So total 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The 4's in the hundreds place occur from page 400 to 488. So how many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 +1 =89). So each of these pages has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. Pages 400-488: The hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so that's 89 pages. So 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +50 +89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. So 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with units place: 8's in units place occur every 10 pages. So from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to 4's, it's 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so page 488 is included, which is an 8 in the units place. So that's one more, making it 48 +1=49 8's in the units place.\n\nTens place: 8's in the tens place occur in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block of 100 pages has 10 8's in the tens place. So how many complete blocks are there in 488 pages? 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Now, the last block is 401-488. In this block, the tens digit is 8 from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So that's 9 8's in the tens place. So total 8's in tens place: 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but wait a second: in the last block, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So yes, 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: The 8's in the hundreds place would occur from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Units: 49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So 49+49=98. That seems right.\n\nSo now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The question is how many more 4's than 8's. So 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, counting 4's:\n\nUnits place: 488/10=48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Then the last group is 481-488, which includes 484, so +1. Total 49.\n\nTens place: Each 100 pages has 10 4's in the tens place. 488/100=4.88, so 4 full blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. Then in the last block (401-488), the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so +10. Total 50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nNow 8's:\n\nUnits place: 488/10=48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Then the last group includes 488, so +1. Total 49.\n\nTens place: Each 100 pages has 10 8's in the tens place. 4 full blocks, so 40. Then in the last block (401-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so +9. Total 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit surprised that the difference is 90. Let me check if I missed anything.\n\nWait, in the tens place for 4's, I considered 440-449 as 10 pages, which is correct. And in the last block for 8's, 480-488 is 9 pages, correct.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 pages. Let me confirm: 488 -400 +1=89. So 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nHmm, another way to check: Let's think about the number of 4's in each digit place.\n\nFor units digit: from 1 to 488, the number of 4's is floor(488/10)=48, plus if the last digit is >=4, which it is (488 ends with 8), so we add 1 if the last digit is >=4. Wait, but actually, the formula is floor((n + 9 - d)/10), where d is the digit. So for units digit 4, it's floor((488 +9 -4)/10)=floor(503/10)=50. Wait, that's different from what I calculated earlier. Did I do that right?\n\nWait, maybe I should use a formula to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each position.\n\nThe formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is:\n\nnumber = (n // 10) * 1 + min(max(n % 10 - d + 1, 0), 10)\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place:\n\nnumber = (n // 100) * 10 + min(max(n % 100 - d*10 + 10, 0), 10)\n\nAnd for the hundreds place:\n\nnumber = (n // 1000) * 100 + min(max(n % 1000 - d*100 + 100, 0), 100)\n\nWait, maybe I should apply this formula to be more accurate.\n\nLet me try this for the units digit of 4:\n\nn=488, d=4.\n\nunits_4 = (488 // 10) * 1 + min(max(488 % 10 -4 +1,0),10)\n=48*1 + min(max(8 -4 +1,0),10)\n=48 + min(max(5,0),10)\n=48 +5=53.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier count of 49. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm misapplying the formula. Let me check the formula again.\n\nI think the correct formula for the number of times digit d appears in the units place up to number n is:\n\nunits = (n // 10) * 1 + (1 if (n % 10 >= d) else 0)\n\nWait, so for units digit 4:\n\nn=488.\n\nunits_4 = (488 //10)*1 + (1 if (488%10 >=4) else 0)\n=48*1 +1=49.\n\nWhich matches my earlier count. So 49 is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens digit:\n\ntens_4 = (488 // 100)*10 + (10 if (488 % 100 >= 40) else (488 % 100 - 40 +1) if (488 %100 >=40) else 0)\n\nWait, maybe it's better to compute it as:\n\ntens_4 = (488 // 100) *10 + min(max(488 % 100 -40 +1, 0),10)\n\nSo:\n\n488//100=4, so 4*10=40.\n\n488%100=88.\n\nSo 88 -40 +1=49.\n\nBut since 49 is more than 10, we take min(49,10)=10.\n\nSo tens_4=40 +10=50.\n\nWhich matches my earlier count.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds digit:\n\nhundreds_4 = (488 //1000)*100 + min(max(488%1000 -400 +1,0),100)\n\n488//1000=0, so 0.\n\n488%1000=488.\n\n488 -400 +1=89.\n\nSo min(89,100)=89.\n\nSo hundreds_4=0 +89=89.\n\nSo total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits digit:\n\nunits_8 = (488//10)*1 + (1 if (488%10 >=8) else 0)\n=48*1 +1=49.\n\nTens digit:\n\ntens_8 = (488//100)*10 + min(max(488%100 -80 +1,0),10)\n=4*10 + min(max(88 -80 +1,0),10)\n=40 + min(9,10)=40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds digit:\n\nhundreds_8 = (488//1000)*100 + min(max(488%1000 -800 +1,0),100)\n=0 + min(max(488 -800 +1,0),100)\n=0 + min(max(-311,0),100)\n=0 +0=0.\n\nSo total 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, so according to this, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me just think again: 188 4's and 98 8's, difference 90. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought about using the formula, I got confused, but now I'm confident that 188-98=90 is correct.\n\nSo the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, the digit 4 appears once, and 8 appears once in every block of 10 numbers.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and an extra 8 numbers. \n\nIn each block of 10, as I said, the units digit 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So, for 48 blocks, the number of 4's in the units place would be 48, and the same for 8's. Now, for the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial block, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). \n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so the units digit there is 8. So, in the units place, the total number of 4's would be 48 (from the complete blocks) plus 1 (from the partial block) = 49. Similarly, the number of 8's in the units place would be 48 plus 1 = 49. Hmm, so in the units place, 4's and 8's are equal. That's interesting.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place in each block of 100. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, it appears 10 times in 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n\nLet me figure out how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages. Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred from 401-488.\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in each hundred, so 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, the digit 4 in the tens place would appear in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 in the tens place would appear in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, so that's 9 times. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the digit 8 in the tens place appears 9 times in the partial hundred.\n\nSo, in the tens place, the total number of 4's would be 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 10 (from the partial hundred) = 50. The number of 8's in the tens place would be 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 9 (from the partial hundred) = 49.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check again. The partial hundred is 401-488, so the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. For 8 in the tens place, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So yes, 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50; 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and then 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, 400-488 is part of the hundreds digit 4. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can't be 8. So, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The hundreds digit for 400-488 is 4, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Since 888 is beyond 488, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit position.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nNow, 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n- Each block of 10 has one 4 and one 8.\n- 488 / 10 = 48 full blocks, with 8 remaining.\n- So, 48 * 1 = 48 for 4's and 8's in units place.\n- Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place total 4's: 48 +1=49; 8's:48+1=49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n- 488 pages mean 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n- So, 4*10=40 for both 4's and 8's in tens place from full hundreds.\n- Partial hundred: 401-488.\n- Tens digits here go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488).\n- So, 4 in tens place: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n- 8 in tens place: 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n- So, total 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50; 8's:40+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 or 1? Wait, no, page 1 is just 1, so hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99.\n- Pages 100-399: hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3.\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4.\n- So, digit 4 in hundreds place: from 400 to 488, which is 488 - 400 +1 = 89 pages.\n- Digit 8 in hundreds place: 0, since the book doesn't go beyond 488. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up:\n- 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98\n- Difference:188 -98=90\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because 4 appears more in the hundreds place, which is a big factor here. Let me see if I did the hundreds place correctly.\n\nYes, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's a lot.\n\nAnd 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all, so 0.\n\nSo, the total 4's are 49+50+89=188, and 8's are 49+49+0=98. So, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to approach this, maybe by considering each digit separately and using a formula or something.\n\nAlternatively, for each digit position, we can calculate the number of times a digit appears using a formula. For example, in the units place, the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to N can be calculated as:\n\nunits = (N // 10) * 1 + min(max(d, N % 10 + 1), d + 1) if d != 0 else (N // 10)\n\nWait, maybe that's a bit too formulaic, but perhaps it's a way to compute it more systematically.\n\nAlternatively, for each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), we can compute the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nBut I think the way I did it before is correct. Let me just verify the counts again.\n\nUnits place:\n- 488 pages.\n- Each 10 pages contribute 1 occurrence of 4 and 1 of 8 in the units place.\n- 488 /10 =48 full groups, with 8 remaining.\n- So, 48*1=48 for both 4 and 8.\n- The remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n- Total units:48+1=49 for both.\n\nTens place:\n- Each 100 pages contribute 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n- 488 /100=4 full groups, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's.\n- So, 4*10=40 for both.\n- The remaining 88 pages (401-488) have tens digits from 0 to 8.\n- For 4 in tens place: 440-449, which is 10 numbers.\n- For 8 in tens place:480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n- So, total tens place:40+10=50 for 4's; 40+9=49 for 8's.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488: 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n- 8's: 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n4's:49+50+89=188\n8's:49+49+0=98\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nYes, that seems consistent. I think I can be confident that the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we need to count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n### Units Place\n- Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n- There are 48 complete blocks of 10 in 488 pages, contributing 48 occurrences of each digit.\n- The remaining 8 pages (481-488) contribute one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n- Total 4's in units place: \\(48 + 1 = 49\\)\n- Total 8's in units place: \\(48 + 1 = 49\\)\n\n### Tens Place\n- Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n- There are 4 complete blocks of 100 in 488 pages, contributing 40 occurrences of each digit.\n- The remaining 88 pages (401-488) contribute 10 occurrences of 4 (440-449) and 9 occurrences of 8 (480-488).\n- Total 4's in tens place: \\(40 + 10 = 50\\)\n- Total 8's in tens place: \\(40 + 9 = 49\\)\n\n### Hundreds Place\n- Pages 400-488 contribute 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n- There are no occurrences of 8 in the hundreds place.\n- Total 4's in hundreds place: 89\n- Total 8's in hundreds place: 0\n\n### Total Counts\n- Total 4's: \\(49 + 50 + 89 = 188\\)\n- Total 8's: \\(49 + 49 + 0 = 98\\)\n\n### Difference\n- The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\(188 - 98 = 90\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]"

After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense, right?\n\nLet me start by considering the different positions where the digits can appear: the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place. I should probably analyze each place separately for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. Units place: The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, the last page is 488, so the last 4 in the units place is 484. So, actually, it's 48 times, right? Because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but we only count up to 484, which is the 48th occurrence. Hmm, maybe I should check that. Let me think: from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is indeed 48 times because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're only going up to 488, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th time. So, 48 times in the units place.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, the digit 4 appears in the tens place from 40 to 49, then 140 to 149, 240 to 249, and 340 to 349, and then 440 to 449. Wait, but since the book goes up to 488, the last set would be 440 to 449. Let me count how many times that is. Each set of 100 pages (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, from 1-400, that's 4 sets, each contributing 10, so 4*10 = 40 times. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is another 10 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 more. So, total for the tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50 times? Wait, no, because from 1-400, it's 4 sets, each with 10, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the next set is 440-449, which is another 10. So, total is 40 + 10 = 50 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 is 10, 340-349 is 10, and 440-449 is another 10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. So, yes, 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. Therefore, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 4 appears 187 times.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. Units place: Similar to 4, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but we take the integer part, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so the last occurrence is at 488, which is the 49th time? Wait, let me think: from 1 to 488, how many multiples of 10 are there? Let's see, 8, 18, 28,...,488. So, the first is 8 (which is 8*1), the last is 488, which is 8*61. Wait, 8*61=488, right? So, 61 times. Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in the range, plus any extra if the last number is beyond that. So, for 8 in the units place, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then an extra one if the last number is beyond 480. But 488 is 488, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, let me confirm: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, yes, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. Tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nEach full hundred has 10 occurrences in the tens place, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, from 1-400, that's 4 sets, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 in all these 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 8 only from 800 to 899, which doesn't occur here. So, the hundreds place doesn't contribute any 8's.\n\nNow, adding up the occurrences of 8: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off because 4 appears 187 times and 8 appears 98 times, so the difference would be 89. But let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 times (from 4,14,...,484)\n- Tens place: 50 times (from 40-49,140-149, etc.)\n- Hundreds place: 89 times (from 400-488)\nTotal: 48+50+89=187\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49 times (from 8,18,...,488)\n- Tens place: 49 times (from 80-89,180-189, etc., and 480-488)\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49+49=98\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8 again. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct.\n\nAnd for units place, 488 is included, so 49 times.\n\nSo, yes, 8 appears 98 times, and 4 appears 187 times. The difference is 89.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the hundreds place for 4 was 89 times, which makes sense because from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**For the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**For the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " \n\nI remember that to count the number of times a particular digit appears, I should look at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. So, I'll need to calculate how many times the digit 4 appears in the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place across all page numbers. I'll do the same for the digit 8 and then find the difference between the total number of 4's and 8's.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4. \n\nFirst, the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 times. But wait, the last group goes up to 488, so the 48th group is from 481 to 490, but since the book only goes up to 488, the units digit 4 appears in 484, which is within that range. So, actually, it's 48 times in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for every 100 numbers, specifically from 40 to 49, 140 to 149, and so on. Each of these blocks has 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 5 times 10, which is 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nAdding those up: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187. So, the digit 4 appears 187 times in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so again, 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, the last group is 481-490, but the book ends at 488, so the units digit 8 appears in 488, which is within that range. So, 48 times in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for every 100 numbers, specifically from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Each complete block (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. There are five such blocks, each contributing 10, so that's 50 times. However, the last block, 480-488, only goes up to 488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), so the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. Wait, no, actually, the tens digit is 8 for all numbers from 480 to 489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers (480 to 488). So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears 49 times? Wait, no, let me think again.\n\nWait, no, each block from 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contributes 10 8's in the tens place. So, for each hundred, it's 10 times. So, up to 488, how many hundreds are there? Let's see, 80-89 is in the first hundred, 180-189 in the second, 280-289 in the third, 380-389 in the fourth, and 480-489 in the fifth. But since we only go up to 488, the last block is only up to 488. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 8's, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's are 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 5 blocks, but actually, only the first four blocks are complete, and the fifth is partial. So, 4 blocks with 10 each, and one block with 9, totaling 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding those up: 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97. So, the digit 8 appears 97 times in total.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8. From 80-89: 10 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers. So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, yes, 49 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's: 48 + 49 = 97.\n\nWait, but earlier for 4's, in the hundreds place, we had 89 numbers from 400-488, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times.\n\nSo, 4's total: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n8's total: 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units place: For every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nNumber of complete decades: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4. So, 48 times. But wait, in the 480-488 range, the units digit 4 appears in 484, which is within that decade, so yes, 48 times.\n\n- Tens place: The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there?\n\nFrom 40-49: 10 numbers.\n\n140-149: another 10.\n\n240-249: another 10.\n\n340-349: another 10.\n\n440-449: another 10.\n\nSo, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.\n\nSo, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n- Units place: Similarly, 48 times as above.\n\n- Tens place: Ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n\nEach of the first four ranges (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, contributing 10 each, so 4*10=40.\n\nThe last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), each with 8 in the tens place. So, 9.\n\nTotal tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: As before, no page numbers from 800-899, so 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: 48 + 49 = 97.\n\nDifference: 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When counting the tens place for 8, I considered 80-89 as one range, 180-189 as another, etc., up to 480-488. So, that's five ranges, but the first four are complete, and the fifth is partial. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 97, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting the hundreds place, I might have made a mistake. Let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of those has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 times. That seems right.\n\nAnd for 8's, no numbers in the hundreds place, so 0.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe digit 4 appears 187 times, and the digit 8 appears 97 times. The difference is 187 - 97 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI remember that when dealing with digit counts, it's helpful to look at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds, etc. So, maybe I should calculate how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and do the same for the digit 8, then find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers. \n\nIn each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), so for 48 blocks, that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, each block of 10 has one 8 (like 8, 18, 28, etc.), so again 48 times. In the remaining 8 numbers, the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total 8's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check: from 1 to 480, there are 48 blocks of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, yes, 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each block of 100. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 100 are there? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an incomplete block from 401-488.\n\nIn each block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 10 times per block. So, for 4 blocks, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the incomplete block from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place, each block of 100 contributes 10 numbers where 8 is in the tens place (80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 10 times per block. For 4 blocks, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the incomplete block from 401-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 8 appears in the tens place from 480-489. But since we're only going up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, does that count as 9 times? Hmm, but actually, when considering the tens place, each full set of 10 numbers contributes one digit. So, from 480-489, the tens digit is 8 for all 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, does that mean 9 times? Or is it 10 times because it's a partial block?\n\nWait, no, I think in the tens place, each digit change happens at the tens. So, from 400-409, the tens digit is 0; 410-419, it's 1; and so on until 480-489, which is 8. So, in the incomplete block, the tens digit 8 appears for 9 numbers (480-488). Therefore, the number of 8's in the tens place is 40 (from the complete blocks) + 9 (from the incomplete block) = 49.\n\nWait, but actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times. So, total 8's in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. For the hundreds digit, each digit from 1 to 4 appears in the hundreds place for 100 numbers each. So, from 1-99, there's no hundreds digit. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, the digit 4 in the hundreds place appears from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 times.\n\nThe digit 8 in the hundreds place would appear if the book had pages beyond 800, but since it's only 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8's in the hundreds place are 0.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations.\n\nUnits place for 4: 48\nTens place for 4: 50\nHundreds place for 4: 89\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187\n\nUnits place for 8: 49\nTens place for 8: 49\nHundreds place for 8: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

So, I'll need to calculate how many times the digit 4 appears in each of these places and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. \n\nFirst, the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and then 8 more numbers (481-488). In each of those 48 sets, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 appears once more in the units place. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, in every set of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, from 1 to 488, how many hundreds are there? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each of the 4 complete hundreds, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit is 4 in the range 400-488. Wait, no, actually, 400-488 is part of the 400s, so the tens digit is 0-8. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's another 10 times. Therefore, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding all those up: Units place 49, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. So, total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 48 sets of 10, each contributing 1, so 48, plus 1 more in 481-488, total 49. Tens place: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40, plus 10 in 440-449, total 50. Hundreds place: 89 times. So, 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems right.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4, in every set of ten, 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, that's 48 complete sets of ten and 8 extra numbers. So, 48 times from the complete sets, and in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once more. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: In every 100 numbers, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, from 1 to 488, there are 4 complete hundreds. Each contributes 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-489. Wait, 480-489 is within 401-488? No, 480-489 is 10 numbers, but 488 is the last page. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, the tens place 8's: 40 (from the four hundreds) plus 9, totaling 49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The remaining pages after 400 are 401-488. So, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481,...,488). So, yes, 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up the 8's: Units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. So, total 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, let me make sure. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so 98 total. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's are 188, total 8's are 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, from 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is the last page with a 4 in the units place, so that's one more, totaling 49. Correct.\n\nTens place: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more, totaling 50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, 48, plus 488, so 489th page? Wait, no, the last page is 488. So, units digit 8 appears in 8, 18, ..., 488. So, how many times? Let's see, from 1 to 488, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (each contributing 1) plus any extra in the last incomplete decade.\n\n488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, so that's one more 8. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nTens place: In each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, from 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, that's 9 more, totaling 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: As the book only goes up to 488, there's no page with hundreds digit 8. So, 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 starting at 480. So, 480 is page 480, and 488 is the last page. So, how many numbers are there from 480 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, 9 times the tens digit is 8. So, yes, 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 4's in the tens place, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10. So, 40 + 10 = 50. Correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked all the steps, so I'm confident that the total number of 4's is 188 and the total number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - In every set of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 480, contributing 48 times.\n   - From 481 to 488, 4 appears once more in the units place (484).\n   - Total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In every set of 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 complete sets of 100, contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 times.\n   - From 400 to 488, 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (440-449).\n   - Total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n   - Total hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - In every set of 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10, contributing 48 times.\n   - From 481 to 488, 8 appears once more in the units place (488).\n   - Total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In every set of 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 complete sets of 100, contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 times.\n   - From 401 to 488, 8 appears in the tens place for 9 numbers (480-488).\n   - Total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8.\n   - Total hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8. Then, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. Units place: The digits cycle every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 pages, 4 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does the last set of 10 pages (481-490) go beyond 488? Yes, because 488 is less than 490. So actually, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48 times, but we need to check if 488 is included. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit cycles up to 8, so the last 4 in the units place would be at 484. So yes, 48 times.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, looking at the tens digit. The tens digit is 4 for every block of 100 pages. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each of these blocks contributes 10 instances of the digit 4 in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Let's see, the first block is 1-100, then 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. So, in the tens place, 4 appears in the blocks 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks. Each block has 10 instances, so 5 x 10 = 50 times. Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so the last block is 440-449, which is entirely within 488. So yes, 5 blocks, 50 times.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them up: Units (48) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, the digit 4 appears 187 times.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\n1. Units place: Similar to the 4's, every 10 pages, 8 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 times. But wait, the last page is 488, which ends with an 8, so does that add an extra 8? Let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (1-480), and then 481-488. In 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more. So, total units place 8's would be 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. Tens place: The tens digit is 8 for every block of 100 pages. Specifically, in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 400-499 range, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 in the 480-488 block is present for pages 480-488, which is 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). So, how many blocks? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 pages\n- 180-189: 10 pages\n- 280-289: 10 pages\n- 380-389: 10 pages\n- 480-488: 9 pages\n\nSo, that's 4 blocks with 10 pages each and 1 block with 9 pages. So, total tens place 8's: (4 x 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding them up: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 98 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 80-89: 10 pages, so 10 times. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Then, 480-488: 9 pages, so 9 times. So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49.\n\nNow, the total 4's are 187, and total 8's are 49. So, the difference is 187 - 49 = 138.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place of 4's, we had 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 times, so 5 x 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 48 times because 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, and since 488 is not a multiple of 10, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is within 488. So, 48 times.\n\nAdding up: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 49 times because 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, and then 488 adds one more 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place for 8's: 49 times as calculated earlier.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49.\n\nDifference: 187 - 49 = 138.\n\nI think that's the answer. So, there are 138 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** Every 10 pages, 4 appears once. There are 48 full decades (1-480), contributing 48 instances. The last page (488) doesn't add an extra 4 in the units place. Total: 48.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place for every block of 100 pages: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 instances, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. This is 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1). Total: 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** Every 10 pages, 8 appears once. There are 48 full decades, contributing 48 instances. The last page (488) adds one more, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place for blocks 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, totaling 40. The last block (480-488) has 9 instances. Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No page numbers reach 800, so 0 instances.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - More 4's than 8's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nI remember that when counting digits in numbers, it's helpful to look at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds. Maybe I can calculate how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and do the same for 8, then find the difference. That sounds like a plan.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once, and the same goes for 8. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 complete sets and then 8 more pages (481 to 488). \n\nIn each complete set, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, 48 sets mean 48 times each for both 4 and 8. Then, looking at the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So, in these, the digit 8 appears once (page 488), but the digit 4 doesn't appear in the units place here because the units digits go up to 8, but 484 would be in the 480s, but wait, 484 is within 481-488? Let me check: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. Yes, page 484 is included, so the units digit 4 appears once here as well. Wait, no, 484 is the units digit 4, so yes, that's another occurrence of 4 in the units place. So, in the remaining 8 pages, 4 appears once (page 484) and 8 appears once (page 488). \n\nWait, but pages 481-488 are from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers. The units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, for the units place, total 4's are 48 (from the complete sets) +1 =49, and 8's are 48 +1=49. So, they are equal in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place 10 times (80-89). \n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10=40 times each. Now, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488), I need to check how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each hundred. Let's break it down:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so from 481-488, the tens digit is 8, but only for 8 numbers (481-488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 times. \n\nSo, in the remaining 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 8 times. \n\nTherefore, total for the tens place: 4's are 40 (from complete hundreds) +10=50, and 8's are 40 +8=48. So, 4's have 50 and 8's have 48 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and then 4 for 400-488. Wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (400-488 inclusive). \n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these, so 89 times. \n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total for the hundreds place: 4's are 89, and 8's are 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 +50 +89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 +48 +0 =97\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 188 -97 =91.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place:\n- 48 complete sets of 10: 48 times each\n- Remaining 8 pages: 481-488, units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484), 8 appears once (488)\nTotal 4's in units: 48+1=49\nTotal 8's in units: 48+1=49\n\nTens place:\n- 4 complete hundreds: 4*10=40 each\n- Remaining 88 pages: 401-488\n  - 441-450: 10 times 4\n  - 481-488: 8 times 8\nTotal 4's in tens: 40+10=50\nTotal 8's in tens: 40+8=48\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488: 89 times 4\n- 8 never appears in hundreds place: 0\nTotal 4's in hundreds:89\nTotal 8's in hundreds:0\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 91.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the positions of the digits in the page numbers. Each page number can be thought of as having units, tens, and hundreds places. For example, page 123 has 1 in the hundreds place, 2 in the tens place, and 3 in the units place. Since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But wait, page 488 is the last one, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4, but only up to 488, so I have to be careful with the hundreds place when it's 4.\n\nI think I should handle each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start with the units place because that might be simpler. \n\nFor the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. So, for the units place, I can calculate how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488 pages and then see how many 4's and 8's are there. Then, I'll check the remaining pages beyond the last complete set of 10.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to compute the number of times each digit appears in each position separately. So, let me structure this.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in the units place. The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, for every 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra pages (since 48*10=480, and 488-480=8). \n\nIn each complete group of 10, there's one 4 in the units place, so 48 groups would have 48*1=48 fours. Now, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 4 appear in the units place in these? Yes, at 484. So, that's one more 4. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: Each group of 10 has one 8 in the units place, so 48 groups give 48 eights. The remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 488 is included, which is an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more 8. So, total 8's in units place: 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, so in the units place, both 4's and 8's appear 49 times each. So, no difference there. Now, let's move on to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, the digits cycle every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers. For example, from 10-19, the tens digit is 1; from 20-29, it's 2, and so on. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, it appears from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Similarly, for 8 in the tens place, it's 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers instead of 10.\n\nSo, let's calculate the number of 4's in the tens place. Each full block (like 40-49) contributes 10 fours. How many full blocks are there? Let's see: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours. Now, in the last block, 480-488, the tens digit is 8, not 4, so no additional fours here. Wait, no, wait, 480-488 has 8 in the hundreds place, but the tens digit is 8, so that's part of the 8's count, not the 4's. So, for 4's in the tens place, it's 5 blocks of 10, so 50 fours.\n\nNow, for 8's in the tens place. The blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks are full, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 eights. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, so 4's in tens place: 50, 8's in tens place: 49. So, 50-49=1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, and 4 for 300-399, 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488. Let's calculate how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, so 89 fours.\n\nNow, how about 8's in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, 4's in hundreds place: 89, 8's in hundreds place: 0. So, that's 89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each digit position.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's), which equals 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, units place:\n- 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1 four and 1 eight. So, 48 fours and 48 eights. Then, the remaining 8 pages: 481-488. The units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, units place: 48+1=49 fours, 48+1=49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\nFor 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 fours, so 50 fours. Correct.\n\nFor 8's: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks are 10 each, so 40, and the last block is 9, so total 49 eights. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n4's: From 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 fours. Correct.\n\n8's: None, since the book ends at 488. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me check the hundreds place again. The hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488, which is indeed 89 pages because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So that's correct.\n\nAnother thing to check: when calculating the tens place for 8's, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, right? Because 480 is 4 8 0, so tens digit is 8, and that continues up to 488, which is 4 8 8. So, that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, 9 eights there. So, 4*10=40 from the earlier blocks, plus 9, totaling 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, the last block is 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, 5 blocks, 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting 4's:**\n   - **Units Place:** \n     - Each group of 10 pages (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) has one 4 in the units place.\n     - There are 48 complete groups (480 pages) contributing 48 fours.\n     - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) include one 4 (484).\n     - Total: 48 + 1 = 49 fours.\n   \n   - **Tens Place:** \n     - Each block of 100 pages (e.g., 40-49, 140-149) has 10 fours in the tens place.\n     - There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), contributing 5\u00d710=50 fours.\n     - Total: 50 fours.\n   \n   - **Hundreds Place:** \n     - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, totaling 89 pages.\n     - Total: 89 fours.\n\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours.\n\n2. **Counting 8's:**\n   - **Units Place:** \n     - Each group of 10 pages has one 8 in the units place.\n     - 48 groups contribute 48 eights.\n     - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) include one 8 (488).\n     - Total: 48 + 1 = 49 eights.\n   \n   - **Tens Place:** \n     - Each block of 100 pages (e.g., 80-89, 180-189) has 10 eights in the tens place.\n     - 4 complete blocks contribute 4\u00d710=40 eights.\n     - Pages 480-488 contribute 9 eights in the tens place.\n     - Total: 40 + 9 = 49 eights.\n   \n   - **Hundreds Place:** \n     - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n     - Total: 0 eights.\n\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights.\n\n3. **Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI remember that when dealing with digit counting problems, it's helpful to separate the digits into their places: units, tens, hundreds, etc. So, I'll need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each place (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. \n\nFirst, the units place. In every set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets and then an extra 8 pages. So, in each full set of ten, there's one 4 in the units place. That would be 48 times. But wait, the last set goes up to 488, which is 488 pages. So, the last partial set is from 481 to 488. In this partial set, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (at 484). So, total units place 4's would be 48 (from the full sets) plus 1 (from the partial set) = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire block of ten numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all ten numbers. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, the first block is 40-49, the next is 140-149, then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is still within 488, right? Let me check: 440-449 is ten numbers, and 488 is higher, so that's five blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. So, that's 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in every set of ten numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many full tens are there? Again, 48 full sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48. The last partial set is 481-488, which includes 488, so the units digit 8 appears once here as well. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for an entire block of ten numbers, like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481,...,488). So, how many full blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89 is one, 180-189 is two, 280-289 is three, 380-389 is four, and 480-488 is five, but only 9 numbers. Each full block contributes 10 8's in the tens place, but the last block only contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 from the last partial block, totaling 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 8's.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems off because earlier, for 4's, we had 188, and for 8's, 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to miscount.\n\nLet me recount the tens place for 8's. The blocks are 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 4 full blocks contributing 10 each, so 4\u00d710=40, plus 9 from the last block, totaling 49. That seems correct.\n\nFor the units place, 48 full sets of ten, each contributing one 8, and the last set from 481-488, which includes 488, so one more 8, making it 49. That also seems correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place, since we don't reach 800, it's 0. So, total 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nFor 4's, units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. So, 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when counting the hundreds place, I might have made a mistake. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems right.\n\nAnother way to think about it: from 1-488, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488, which is indeed 89 numbers. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10 and an additional 8 numbers. Thus, 48 + 1 = 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks of 10 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149). There are 5 such blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers: 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears once every 10 numbers: 48 full sets + 1 = 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks of 10 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488). The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers reach 800, so 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI think the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have the total counts for both digits, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit position separately.\n\n1. **Units place:** The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in every set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1 to 10, the 4 appears once (page 4). From 11 to 20, it's page 14, and so on.\n\n   Since the book has 488 pages, the number of complete groups of 10 is 48 (because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups). Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, we also have the last partial group from 481 to 488. In this group, the units digit 4 appears once (page 484). So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, let's look at the tens digit. The tens digit changes every 10 numbers. For example, from 1-9, there's no tens digit, but from 10-19, the tens digit is 1, and so on. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, and 340-349.\n\n   Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks exist in 488 pages.\n\n   - The first block is 40-49: 10 numbers.\n   - The second block is 140-149: another 10.\n   - The third block is 240-249: another 10.\n   - The fourth block is 340-349: another 10.\n   - The next block would be 440-449, but 440-449 is within 488, right? Wait, 440 is less than 488, so that's another 10.\n\n   Wait, let me check: 440-449 is indeed within 488, so that's five blocks? Wait, no, let me count again. From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. Then 100-199: 140-149 is another. 200-299: 240-249. 300-399: 340-349. 400-488: 440-449. So that's five blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 50.\n\n   Wait, but let me make sure. Let's calculate how many complete hundreds are there. From 1 to 488, the hundreds digits go up to 4 (since 488 is in the 400s). So, each hundred has one block of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100: 40-49 (10 numbers). 101-200: 140-149 (10). 201-300: 240-249 (10). 301-400: 340-349 (10). 401-488: 440-449 (10). So that's five blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. So, yes, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences of the digit 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers in the units place. So, for 488 pages, the number of complete groups of 10 is 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups). Each group contributes one 8, so that's 48. Now, the last partial group is 481-488, which includes 488. So, in this group, the units digit 8 appears once (page 488). So, total 8's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers, right? Because 489 is beyond 488. So, let's check each block.\n\n   - 80-89: 10 numbers.\n   - 180-189: 10.\n   - 280-289: 10.\n   - 380-389: 10.\n   - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page).\n\n   So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last block contributes 9. So, total number of 8's in the tens place is 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 for all numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full groups (1-480) = 48, plus 484 in the last group (481-488) = 49.\n- Tens: Each hundred has one block of 10, so 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10, so 50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full groups (1-480) = 48, plus 488 in the last group, so 49.\n- Tens: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 (each 10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. When I considered 480-488, I said there are 9 numbers, but actually, from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers because 488 - 480 = 8, but including both ends, it's 9. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother check: For 4's in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, which is correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers contribute one 4. There are 48 complete groups of 10 (480 numbers), contributing 48 fours. The last group (481-488) adds one more 4 (page 484). Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 40-49, 140-149). There are five such blocks up to 488, contributing 10 each. Total: 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. There are 89 such pages. Total: 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to 4, every 10 numbers contribute one 8. There are 48 complete groups, contributing 48 eights. The last group adds one more (page 488). Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 80-89, 180-189). The last block (480-488) contributes 9. Total: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No pages have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488. Total: 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** Subtract the total number of 8's from 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 appears 90 times more than the digit 8 in the page numbers.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers, and do the same for the digit 8. Then, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet's start with the digit 4. I'll need to consider each place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Since the book has 488 pages, the last group is 481-490, but since it's 488, the units digit goes up to 8 in the last group. So, how many full groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full groups, with 8 remaining numbers (481 to 488). So, in each full group, there's one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, in the last partial group (481-488), does the units digit include a 4? Let's see: 484 is within that range, so yes, one more 4. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid, but 540-549 would be beyond. So how many such groups are there? Let's see: each hundred has one group of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So from 1-100: 40-49, that's 10 numbers. Then 101-200: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 201-300: 240-249, another 10. 301-400: 340-349, another 10. Then 401-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 groups, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so yes, that's correct. So total tens place 4's are 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? Because 488 minus 400 is 88, plus 1 is 89. So that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4, every group of 10 has one 8 in the units place. So, from 1-488, how many full groups of 10 are there? 48 full groups (since 488 / 10 = 48.8), so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which is another 8. So total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that range. So how many such groups are there? Let's see: 80-89 is in 1-100, 180-189 in 101-200, 280-289 in 201-300, 380-389 in 301-400, and 480-488 in 401-488. So that's 5 groups, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, except the last one, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So in the tens place, each group contributes 10 8's except the last one, which contributes 9.\n\nWait, let me think again. For the first four groups (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so that's 4 groups * 10 = 40. Then, the last group is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), so that's 9 8's in the tens place. So total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So yes, 9 8's in the tens place for that group. So total tens place 8's are 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place 8's are 0.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. For the units place, 49 8's, tens place 49 8's, and hundreds place 0, so total 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the units place was 49 and tens place was 49, so 98 total 8's. Now, let me compare that to the 4's, which were 188. So the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, for the 4's in the hundreds place, I had 89 numbers from 400-488, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89. Then tens place was 50, units was 49, totaling 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's: units place, 49; tens place, 49; hundreds place, 0. So total 98. So 188 - 98 = 90. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. I had 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 4*10 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the units place for 8's. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then in the last group, 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which is another 8. So 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nSo the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting digits, especially in different places, it's easy to make an off-by-one error. Let me verify the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89. Correct.\n\nFor the 4's in the tens place, I had 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five groups, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 4,14,24,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many? The last one is 484, which is the 49th occurrence because 484 is 480 + 4, so 48*10 + 4, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, and then 484 is the 49th. So 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So 4 full groups of 10, contributing 40, and the last group contributing 9, so 49. Correct.\n\nSo yes, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** Every 10 numbers contribute one 4. There are 48 full groups (1-480) and one partial group (481-488) with 484, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** Each hundred has a group (40-49, 140-149, etc.), totaling 5 groups \u00d7 10 = 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 have 89 numbers with 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 48 full groups and one partial group, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** Groups are 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last group (480-488) contributing 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the first thing I should do is figure out how many times each digit (4 and 8) appears in each place: units, tens, and hundreds. That way, I can count the total number of 4's and 8's separately and then find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So from 1 to 10, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once (at 4) and the digit 8 appears once (at 8). \n\nNow, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 more pages. So, for each complete set, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Therefore, for 48 sets, that's 48 fours and 48 eights. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, adding those, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so 488 would be included in the remaining 8 pages. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nNext, I'll move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: 40-49. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: 80-89. \n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds and then 88 more pages. \n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens place contributes 10 fours and 10 eights. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours and 40 eights. \n\nNow, for the remaining 88 pages (from 401 to 488), the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8. So, let's see. The tens digit in this range goes from 0 (for 401-410) to 8 (for 480-488). \n\nWait, actually, from 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, in this range, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It would be from 440-449, which is 10 times. Similarly, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? From 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, no, actually, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens place contributes 10 fours and 9 eights.\n\nSo, adding that to the earlier counts, the total fours in the tens place are 40 (from the first 400 pages) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. The total eights in the tens place are 40 (from the first 400 pages) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49.\n\nNow, I should check if that's correct. Wait, from 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for the tens digit being 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For the tens digit being 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and so on up to 4 for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, 400-488 would have a hundreds digit of 4, but 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488. \n\nWait, let me clarify: The hundreds digit is 1 from 1-99, 2 from 100-199, 3 from 200-299, 4 from 300-399, and 4 from 400-488. Wait, that can't be right because 400-488 is within the 400s, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. \n\nWait, but 300-399 is 100 pages, so the hundreds digit is 3 for 100 pages, and then 400-488 is 89 pages with hundreds digit 4. \n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's 89 times (from 400 to 488). How many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, the count for 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The hundreds digit goes from 1 to 4, right? 1 for 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, and 4 for 300-399 and 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 399 - 300 + 1 = 100 pages (300-399) plus 89 pages (400-488), but wait, no, 300-399 is 100 pages, and 400-488 is 89 pages, so total hundreds digit 4 is 100 + 89 = 189 pages. Wait, no, that's not correct because 300-399 is 100 pages, and 400-488 is 89 pages, so the hundreds digit 4 appears in 100 (from 300-399) + 89 (from 400-488) = 189 pages. But wait, no, that's not right because the hundreds digit for 300-399 is 3, not 4. Wait, I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, no, the hundreds digit is 3 for 200-299, which is 100 pages, and 4 for 400-488, which is 89 pages. Wait, but 300-399 would have a hundreds digit of 3, right? So, 300-399 is 100 pages, and 400-488 is 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8's in the hundreds place are 0.\n\nWait, that makes sense because 800 would be page 800, but our book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit only goes up to 4.\n\nNow, let me summarize the counts so far.\n\nFor the units place:\n- 4's: 49\n- 8's: 49\n\nFor the tens place:\n- 4's: 50\n- 8's: 49\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nNow, I need to add up all the occurrences of 4's and 8's across units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nTotal 4's = units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nTotal 8's = units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so total 4's are 188 and total 8's are 98. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 188 - 98 = 90 more than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big difference. Let me go through each place again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place:\n- Each 10 pages contribute one 4 and one 8.\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens and 8 extra pages.\n- So, 48 * 1 = 48 fours and 48 eights.\n- In the remaining 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n- So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 fours, 48 + 1 = 49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each 100 pages, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n- For 488 pages, there are 4 full hundreds (1-400) and then 88 pages (401-488).\n- In each full hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49), and 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n- So, 4 hundreds contribute 4 * 10 = 40 fours and 4 * 10 = 40 eights.\n- Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488).\n- For the tens digit 4: it's from 440-449, which is 10 pages.\n- For the tens digit 8: it's from 480-488, which is 9 pages because 488 is the last page.\n- So, in the remaining 88 pages, tens place contributes 10 fours and 9 eights.\n- Therefore, total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 fours, 40 + 9 = 49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- The hundreds digit is 1 for 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399 and 400-488.\n- So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n- The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488.\n- So, hundreds place: 89 fours, 0 eights. Correct.\n\nAdding them up:\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n- Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me think if I'm counting correctly. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, the hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: total number of digits printed.\n\nBut maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nWait, another approach: for each position (units, tens, hundreds), count the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n- As before, 49 fours, 49 eights.\n\nTens place:\n- 50 fours, 49 eights.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, so the answer would be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if the hundreds place for 4 is correctly 89. From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. Each of these pages has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 fours. Correct.\n\nAnd in the tens place, from 400-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, for each ten, the tens digit is 4 once (440-449) and 8 once (480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page). So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about the tens place: from 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 fours. And 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, another thought: when calculating the units place, I considered 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens and 8 extra pages. So, 48 fours and 48 eights from the full tens, plus 1 four and 1 eight from the extra 8 pages, totaling 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with a smaller example to see if my method works. Suppose I have a book with 20 pages. How many 1's and 2's are there?\n\nPage numbers: 1-20.\n\nUnits place: 1 appears at 1,11; 2 appears at 2,12. So, 2 each.\n\nTens place: 1 appears at 10-19, so 10 times. 2 appears at 20, so once.\n\nHundreds place: none, since 20 is a two-digit number.\n\nSo, total 1's: 2 (units) + 10 (tens) = 12.\n\nTotal 2's: 2 (units) + 1 (tens) = 3.\n\nDifference: 12 - 3 = 9.\n\nWait, but according to my method:\n\nUnits place: 20 / 10 = 2 full tens, so 2 fours (but in this case, it's 1's). Wait, no, in this example, I'm using 1's and 2's, so perhaps my method is correct.\n\nWait, maybe I should test my method with a smaller number to see if it works.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, but my initial calculation seems to check out. So, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach: for each digit position, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is floor((N + 1)/10) times, plus an adjustment if the last partial set includes d.\n\nWait, more accurately, for units digit:\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is:\n\ncount = (N // 10) * 1 + min(max(d, N % 10), 9) if d != 0 else (N // 10) * 1\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think as:\n\nFor units digit, the number of times d appears is:\n\nnumber_of_complete_groups = N // 10\n\ncount = number_of_complete_groups\n\nif d <= (N % 10):\n    count += 1\n\nBut if d is 0, it's a bit different because 0 doesn't appear in the first group (1-9). So, for d=0, it's (N // 10) - 1 if N >= 10.\n\nWait, maybe this is complicating, but perhaps I can use this formula to check.\n\nSo, for d=4 in units place:\n\nnumber_of_complete_groups = 488 // 10 = 48\n\nremainder = 488 % 10 = 8\n\nsince 4 <= 8, count = 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nFor d=8 in units place:\n\nnumber_of_complete_groups = 48\n\nremainder = 8\n\nsince 8 <=8, count = 48 +1 =49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor tens digit, the formula is similar but with higher magnitude.\n\nnumber_of_complete_groups = N // 100\n\ncount = number_of_complete_groups * 10\n\nremainder = N % 100\n\nif d <= (remainder // 10):\n    count += (remainder // 10 - d + 1) * 10\nelse:\n    count += (d - (remainder // 10 + 1)) * 10\n\nWait, perhaps another way: for tens digit d, the number of times it appears is:\n\ncount = (N // 100) * 10\n\nremainder = N % 100\n\nif d < (remainder // 10):\n    count += 10\nelif d == (remainder // 10):\n    count += (remainder % 10) + 1\nelse:\n    count += 0\n\nWait, let me test this for d=4 in tens place, N=488.\n\nnumber_of_complete_groups = 488 // 100 = 4\n\ncount = 4 * 10 = 40\n\nremainder = 488 % 100 = 88\n\nremainder // 10 = 8\n\nsince 4 < 8, count += 10 \u2192 40 +10=50. Correct.\n\nFor d=8 in tens place:\n\nnumber_of_complete_groups =4\n\ncount =4 *10=40\n\nremainder=88\n\nremainder//10=8\n\nsince 8 ==8, count += (88 %10) +1=8+1=9 \u2192 40+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor hundreds digit d, the count is:\n\nif d < (N // 100):\n    count += 100\nelif d == (N // 100):\n    count += (N % 100) +1\nelse:\n    0\n\nWait, but let's see:\n\nFor d=4:\n\nN=488, N//100=4\n\nsince d=4 ==4, count += (488 %100) +1=88 +1=89.\n\nFor d=8:\n\nN//100=4 <8, so count +=0.\n\nThus, hundreds place: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\nWe analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately:\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - For 488 pages, there are 48 complete sets of 10, contributing 48 fours and 48 eights.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add 1 four (484) and 1 eight (488).\n   - Total: 49 fours, 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - For 488 pages, there are 4 complete hundreds, contributing 40 fours and 40 eights.\n   - The remaining 88 pages (401-488) add 10 fours (440-449) and 9 eights (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 fours, 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - The digit '4' appears from page 400 to 488, which is 89 times.\n   - The digit '8' does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\nSumming up:\n- Total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- Total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI remember that to find how many times a specific digit appears, I can look at each digit place separately\u2014units, tens, hundreds\u2014and count the occurrences in each place. So, maybe I should handle each digit place one by one for both 4's and 8's.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. \n\nBut wait, the book goes up to 488, so I need to see how many complete blocks of 10 there are and then handle any remaining numbers. Let me calculate how many complete tens are there in 488. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers from 481 to 488.\n\nIn each complete block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the digit 8 also appears once (like 8, 18, 28, etc.). So, for each complete block, both 4 and 8 appear once each in the units place. \n\nSince there are 48 complete blocks, the number of 4's in the units place would be 48, and the same for 8's. Now, I need to check the remaining 8 numbers from 481 to 488. The units digits here are 1 through 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's, which is 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both digits appear 49 times each. \n\nHmm, that means the count is the same in the units place, so the difference must come from the tens or hundreds place. Let me move on to the tens place.\n\nFor the tens digit, things are a bit different. The tens digit changes every 10 numbers. For example, from 1-10, the tens digit is 0 or 1 (for 10). Wait, actually, in page numbers, the tens digit is 0 for pages 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on up to 480-488 where the tens digit is 8.\n\nSo, each tens digit from 0 to 8 repeats for 10 pages each, except the last one, which might be shorter. Let me see how many times each tens digit appears.\n\nThe tens digit cycles every 100 pages. So, from 1 to 100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each tens digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. But since our book only goes up to 488, I need to adjust for that.\n\nFirst, let's consider the complete hundreds. The book has 488 pages, so it's 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. Wait, no, actually, each tens digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred. So, in 1-100, the tens digit 0 appears 10 times (pages 1-9 and 100), but wait, actually, the tens digit 0 appears from 1-9 (but technically, the tens digit is 0 for pages 1-9, and then for 10-19, it's 1, etc. So, in 1-100, each tens digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times. Similarly, in 101-200, each tens digit from 0-9 appears 10 times, and so on.\n\nSo, for each hundred, each tens digit appears 10 times. Since there are 4 complete hundreds, each tens digit from 0-9 appears 4*10 = 40 times in the tens place from 1-400.\n\nNow, let's look at the remaining pages from 401-488. The tens digits here range from 0 (for 401-410) to 8 (for 480-488). Let me break this down.\n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit is 0 (since 401 is 4 0 1, so tens digit is 0). Pages 401-410: 10 pages, so tens digit 0 appears 10 times.\n\nFrom 411-420: tens digit is 1, 10 pages.\n\n...\n\nFrom 481-490: tens digit is 8, but wait, our book only goes up to 488, so from 481-488, that's 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for all these pages. So, how many times does the tens digit 8 appear in 401-488?\n\nLet me count. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. For each tens digit from 0 to 7, they each appear 10 times, except the last one, which is 8 and appears 8 times (from 481-488).\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. From 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 pages.\n\n411-420: tens digit 1, 10 pages.\n\n421-430: tens digit 2, 10 pages.\n\n431-440: tens digit 3, 10 pages.\n\n441-450: tens digit 4, 10 pages.\n\n451-460: tens digit 5, 10 pages.\n\n461-470: tens digit 6, 10 pages.\n\n471-480: tens digit 7, 10 pages.\n\n481-488: tens digit 8, 8 pages.\n\nSo, for tens digits 0-7, each appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times in the 401-488 range.\n\nSo, total tens digit counts:\n\nFor each digit 0-9, in 401-488:\n\n- 0: 10\n- 1: 10\n- 2: 10\n- 3: 10\n- 4: 10\n- 5: 10\n- 6: 10\n- 7: 10\n- 8: 8\n\nSo, in the tens place, for digits 0-7, they each appear 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and the tens digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nAdding this to the counts from the complete hundreds (40 times each), the total counts in the tens place are:\n\n- 4's: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50\n- 8's: 40 (from 1-400) + 8 (from 401-488) = 48\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 48 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit 4 appears from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nThe hundreds digit 8 doesn't appear at all because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's: 89, 8's: 0.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit across all places.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from total 4's.\n\n188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- Complete blocks: 48 blocks of 10, each contributing 1 four and 1 eight. So, 48 each.\n- Remaining 8 numbers: 481-488. Units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 +1 =49 for both. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- From 1-400: each tens digit 0-9 appears 40 times (4 hundreds, 10 each). So, 4's:40, 8's:40.\n- From 401-488:\n  - Tens digits 0-7: each appears 10 times.\n  - Tens digit 8: appears 8 times.\n  So, 4's in tens place:10, 8's:8.\n- Total tens place: 4's=40+10=50, 8's=40+8=48. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n- 8's: none, so 0. Correct.\n\nTotal counts:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =97\n\nDifference:188 -97=91\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 91.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " \n\nI remember that to find the number of times a particular digit appears, I can look at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. So, I'll need to calculate how many times the digit 4 appears in the units place, tens place, and hundreds place across all page numbers. Then I'll do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4. \n\nFirst, the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and then 8 more pages. So, in each of the 48 complete sets, there's one 4 in the units place, giving me 48 * 1 = 48 fours. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit cycles from 1 to 8, so 484 is the only number with a 4 in the units place. That's one more 4. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Here, the digit 4 appears in a block of ten numbers. For example, from 40-49, each number has a 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, the first block is 40-49, the next would be 140-149, then 240-249, and 340-349. That's four blocks. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40 fours. Wait, but the last block is 340-349, and after that, the next block would be 440-449, but since the book only goes up to 488, 440-449 is still within the range because 449 is less than 488. So, that's actually five blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these contributes 10 fours, so 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, did I make a mistake earlier? Let me check again. From 1 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers. So, for 400 pages, that would be 4 * 10 = 40. But since we have 488 pages, which is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5 * 10 = 50. Yes, that seems right. So, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, in every set of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488? As before, 48 complete sets and 8 extra. So, 48 * 1 = 48 eights in the units place. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 is the only number with an 8 in the units place. That's one more, so total units place eights are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let me think. Each hundred has a block where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89 is the first block, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 480-488 is actually 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them because 480-488 is 480 to 488, so the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9 eights.\n\nWait, let me clarify: The first block is 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 eights. The next block is 180-189, another 10 eights. Similarly, 280-289 and 380-389 each have 10 eights. Then, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 for all these 9 numbers. Therefore, the number of eights in the tens place is 4 blocks * 10 + 1 block * 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, which is the hundreds place. But when considering the tens place, 480-488 is indeed 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, total eights in the tens place are 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? The blocks are:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers\n\nSo, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check again. For the units place, we had 49 eights, and for the tens place, 49 eights, so total 98 eights.\n\nWait, but earlier, for the 4's, we had 188 fours. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the eights in the tens place. Let me recount:\n\nFrom 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in the following ranges:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers\n\nSo, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place, in each set of 10, 8 appears once, so 48 full sets give 48, plus the last partial set (481-488) gives one more 8 (at 488). So, 49 in units.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nFours: 188.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the fours in the tens place. Let me check again.\n\nFor the tens place, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So, that's five blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. So, that's correct.\n\nAnd in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nAnd for 8's, as we saw, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, so 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count or miss any numbers. Let me think about the hundreds place for 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct because 488 - 400 +1 = 89.\n\nFor the tens place, 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50.\n\nUnits place: For 4's, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1, so 48, plus the last partial set (481-488) which includes 484, so one more. So, 49.\n\nSame for 8's: Units place, 48 full sets, 48 eights, plus 488, so 49.\n\nTens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. That's five blocks, but the last one has 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49.\n\nSo, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, total 98.\n\nSo, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90 more fours.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there any overlap or something I'm missing? For example, in the tens place, when counting both 4's and 8's, are there any overlaps? I don't think so because each digit is in a different place.\n\nWait, but let me think about the number 488. It has an 8 in the hundreds place? No, wait, 488 is 4 in the hundreds, 8 in the tens, and 8 in the units. So, in the hundreds place, 488 is part of the 400-488 range, so it's counted in the hundreds place for 4's. But for 8's, the hundreds digit is only 8 if the number is 800 or above, which doesn't happen here. So, no overlap in the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, when counting 4's and 8's, they are separate because one is in the tens and the other is in the units or hundreds.\n\nSo, I think my counts are correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me just check the arithmetic again to be sure.\n\n188 - 98: 188 - 90 is 98, so 188 - 98 is 90. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** In every block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once. There are 48 full blocks (1-480) contributing 48 fours. The last partial block (481-488) adds one more 4 (at 484). Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each block (e.g., 40-49). There are five such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 fours. Total: 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, there are 89 numbers with 4 in the hundreds place. Total: 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 48 full blocks contribute 48 eights. The last block adds one more at 488. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each block (e.g., 80-89). There are four full blocks and a partial block (480-488) contributing 9 eights. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place. Total: 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) separately and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4. \n\nFirst, I'll count how many times 4 appears in the units place. In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, there are 48 complete groups and then a partial group of 8 numbers (481 to 488). In each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.). So that's 48 times. Now, in the partial group from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484). So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, I'll count the number of 4's in the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.). From 1 to 488, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then the 401-488 range. In each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for the entire range (401-410, 411-420, ..., 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 401-488). Wait, actually, the tens digit is 4 in 401-410, 411-420, etc., but since 488 is less than 500, we need to check how many full decades are there. From 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 401-410, 411-420, 421-430, 431-440, 441-450, 451-460, 461-470, 471-480, and 481-488. Wait, but from 401-488, the tens digit cycles every 10 numbers. So how many times does the tens digit 4 occur? Let me think differently. The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So in total, for the tens place, from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear? Each hundred has 10, so 4 hundreds would have 40, but wait, actually, the first hundred (1-100) has 40-49, which is 10 times. The second hundred (101-200) has 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249 and 340-349 each add 10, so that's 4 times 10, which is 40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409, 410-419, etc., but wait, actually, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, which is 10 numbers, but 400-409 is part of 401-488. So that's another 10. So total tens place 4's would be 40 (from the first four hundreds) plus 10, making it 50. Wait, but 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409, 410-419, ..., up to 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the last group is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409 (10 numbers), 410-419 (another 10), 420-429 (10), 430-439 (10), 440-449 (10), 450-459 (10), 460-469 (10), 470-479 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 8 full decades (each contributing 10) and one partial decade (9). So that's 8*10 +9=89. Wait, but that can't be right because we're only counting the tens digit 4. Wait, no, in each of these decades, the tens digit is 4, so each decade contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So from 400-488, how many full decades with tens digit 4 are there? Let's see: 400-409: tens digit 4, 10 numbers. 410-419: tens digit 4, 10 numbers. 420-429: tens digit 4, 10 numbers. 430-439: tens digit 4, 10 numbers. 440-449: tens digit 4, 10 numbers. 450-459: tens digit 4, 10 numbers. 460-469: tens digit 4, 10 numbers. 470-479: tens digit 4, 10 numbers. 480-488: tens digit 4, but only 9 numbers. So that's 8 full decades (each 10) and one partial with 9. So that's 8*10 +9=89. Wait, but that's the count for the tens digit 4 in the 400-488 range. But wait, no, because the tens digit is 4 in each of those decades, but each decade contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, regardless of the units digit. So actually, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409 (10), 410-419 (10), 420-429 (10), 430-439 (10), 440-449 (10), 450-459 (10), 460-469 (10), 470-479 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 8 full decades with 10 each and one partial with 9, totaling 8*10 +9=89. But wait, that seems too high because from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409, 410-419, etc., up to 480-488, which is 9 decades. So each decade contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, except the last one which contributes 9. So total tens digit 4's in 400-488 is 9 decades, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So that's 8*10 +9=89. But wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers? No, 488-400+1=89 numbers. Wait, but we're counting the tens digit, not the total numbers. So in the 400-488 range, how many times does the tens digit 4 occur? Each full decade (like 400-409) contributes 10, and the last partial decade (480-488) contributes 9. So that's 8 full decades (400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479) which is 8*10=80, plus the 480-488 which is 9. So total 89. Wait, but that can't be because from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409 (10), 410-419 (10), ..., 480-488 (9). So that's 9 decades, but the first 8 are full and the last is partial. So total tens digit 4's in 400-488 is 8*10 +9=89. But wait, that's 89, but that seems high because from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409, which is 10, 410-419, another 10, and so on up to 480-488, which is 9. So that's 8 full decades (each 10) and one partial (9), so 89. But wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, but the tens digit 4 occurs 89 times? That can't be because each number has only one digit in the tens place. Wait, no, each number has a tens digit, but the count of how many times 4 appears in the tens place is 89. So in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 occurs 89 times. But that seems too high because from 400-488, the tens digit cycles every 10. So for each hundred, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times. So from 400-499, it would be 100 numbers, with the tens digit 4 occurring 10 times in each decade, so 10 times 10 =100? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, in each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So in 400-499, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409, 410-419, ..., 490-499, which is 10 times per hundred. So in 400-488, which is part of the 400-499 range, how many full decades are there? 400-409 (10), 410-419 (10), 420-429 (10), 430-439 (10), 440-449 (10), 450-459 (10), 460-469 (10), 470-479 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 8 full decades and one partial, totaling 8*10 +9=89. So yes, 89 times the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-488. But wait, that seems high because 400-488 is only 89 numbers, and each number has a tens digit, so the tens digit 4 occurs 89 times? No, that's not correct because each number has a tens digit, but the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 89 numbers. So that's correct. So total tens digit 4's in the entire book would be the tens digit 4's in 1-399 plus those in 400-488. From 1-399, how many times does the tens digit 4 occur? Each hundred (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, it's 89. So total tens digit 4's: 40 +89=129. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. From 1-399, the tens digit 4 occurs 4 times 10=40. From 400-488, it's 89. So total 129. Hmm, that seems plausible.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. So how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89 numbers. So the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 (units) +129 (tens) +89 (hundreds)= 49+129=178, 178+89=267. So 267 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488/10=48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing 1 occurrence of 8 in the units place (like 8,18,28,...). So 48 times. Then, the partial group from 481-488: the units digits go from 1-8, so 8 appears once (488). So total units place 8's: 48+1=49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit 8 occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\nFrom 1-399: each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40.\n\nFrom 400-488: the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488-480+1=9 numbers. So in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo total tens place 8's: 40 (from 1-399) +9=49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So the hundreds place contributes 0 8's.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nNow, subtracting the total 8's from the total 4's: 267-98=169.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because 169 seems high, but maybe it's correct.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's and 8's.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 129\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal:49+129=178, 178+89=267.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal:98.\n\nDifference:267-98=169.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me check the tens place for 4's again because earlier I thought it might be 50, but I ended up with 129, which seems high.\n\nWait, when I calculated the tens place for 4's, I had 40 from 1-399 and 89 from 400-488, totaling 129. But let me verify that.\n\nFrom 1-399, each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 4, so 4*10=40.\n\nFrom 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. Each full decade (like 400-409) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many full decades are there in 400-488? Let's see:\n\n400-409:10\n410-419:10\n420-429:10\n430-439:10\n440-449:10\n450-459:10\n460-469:10\n470-479:10\n480-488:9\n\nSo that's 8 full decades (each 10) and one partial (9). So 8*10 +9=89.\n\nSo yes, 89 in the 400-488 range, plus 40 from 1-399, totaling 129. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, the tens place in 400-488 is only 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. Plus 40 from 1-399, totaling 49.\n\nSo the calculations seem correct, leading to 267-98=169.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can write a small program or use a formula to verify, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll try another approach.\n\nAnother way to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each position is:\n\nFor units place:\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is floor((n + 1)/10) * 1 + extra if the last partial group includes d.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place, it's floor((n + 1)/100) * 10 + extra.\n\nFor hundreds place, floor((n +1)/1000)*100 + extra.\n\nBut let me apply this formula for digit 4.\n\nUnits place for 4:\nNumber of complete groups of 10: floor(488/10)=48. Each contributes 1, so 48. Then, check the last partial group: 481-488. The units digits go from 1-8, so 4 is included once. So total units 4's:48+1=49.\n\nTens place for 4:\nNumber of complete groups of 100: floor(488/100)=4. Each contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Then, the remaining numbers are 401-488. The tens digit cycles every 10, so how many full decades are there in 401-488? 488-400=88, so 88 numbers. 88/10=8 full decades, each contributing 10, so 8*10=80. Plus, check if the last partial decade includes 4 in the tens place. The last partial is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, and the tens digit is 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the tens place here. Wait, no, the tens digit in 480-488 is 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the tens place here. So total tens 4's:40 (from complete groups) +80=120. Wait, but earlier I had 129. Hmm, discrepancy here.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the earlier calculation. Let's see.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nTens place for 4:\nNumber of complete hundreds: floor(488/100)=4. Each contributes 10, so 4*10=40.\n\nRemaining numbers after 400:488-400=88. So how many full decades in 88 numbers? 88/10=8 full decades, each contributing 10, so 8*10=80.\n\nTotal tens 4's:40+80=120.\n\nBut earlier, I counted 89 in the 400-488 range, which when added to 40 gave 129. So which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is missing something. Let me think.\n\nFrom 1-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in:\n\n- 40-49:10\n- 140-149:10\n- 240-249:10\n- 340-349:10\n- 440-449:10\n- 400-409:10\n- 410-419:10\n- 420-429:10\n- 430-439:10\n- 440-449:10\n- 450-459:10\n- 460-469:10\n- 470-479:10\n- 480-488:9 (but wait, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, so 4 doesn't appear here)\n\nWait, no, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479, which is 8 full decades, each contributing 10, so 8*10=80. Then, 480-488 has tens digit 8, so no 4's. So total tens 4's in 400-488 is 80. So total tens 4's:40 (from 1-399) +80=120.\n\nSo according to this, the total tens 4's are 120, not 129 as I previously thought. So where did I go wrong earlier?\n\nAh, I see. Earlier, I mistakenly included 480-488 as contributing 9 tens 4's, but actually, in that range, the tens digit is 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the tens place. So the correct count is 80 in 400-488, making total tens 4's 40+80=120.\n\nSimilarly, for units 4's, it's 49, and hundreds 4's:89.\n\nSo total 4's:49+120+89=258.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier 267. So which is correct?\n\nLet me recount:\n\nUnits place 4's:49\n\nTens place 4's:120\n\nHundreds place 4's:89\n\nTotal:49+120=169, 169+89=258.\n\nWait, that's 258, but earlier I thought it was 267. So I must have made a mistake in the tens place count.\n\nYes, I think using the formula is more accurate. So tens place 4's:120.\n\nSimilarly, let's recount 8's.\n\nUnits place 8's:49\n\nTens place 8's:49\n\nHundreds place 8's:0\n\nTotal:98.\n\nSo the difference would be 258-98=160.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because two different methods are giving me different results. Let me try to resolve this.\n\nThe formula approach seems more systematic, so perhaps I made a mistake in the initial manual count.\n\nLet me re-examine the tens place for 4's.\n\nFrom 1-399:\n\nEach hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4:40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349. So 4*10=40.\n\nFrom 400-488:\n\nThe tens digit is 4 in 400-409,410-419,...,470-479. That's 8 full decades, each contributing 10, so 8*10=80.\n\nSo total tens 4's:40+80=120.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo total 4's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:120\n\nHundreds:89\n\nTotal:49+120=169, 169+89=258.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:49\n\nHundreds:0\n\nTotal:98.\n\nDifference:258-98=160.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 169. So which is correct?\n\nI think the formula approach is correct, so the difference is 160.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 488-400+1=89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo units:49, tens:120, hundreds:89. Total 4's:258.\n\nUnits:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 8's:98.\n\nDifference:258-98=160.\n\nSo I think the correct answer is 160 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 267-98=169, but that was due to an incorrect count in the tens place. So the correct difference is 160.\n\nLet me try another way to confirm.\n\nAnother approach is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits place: floor(488/10)=48 full groups, each contributing 1, plus if the last partial group (481-488) includes 4, which it does (484), so 48+1=49.\n\nTens place: floor(488/100)=4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, the remaining numbers are 400-488, which is 89 numbers. The tens digit cycles every 10, so floor(89/10)=8 full decades, each contributing 10, so 8*10=80. The last partial decade is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but the tens digit here is 8, so no 4's. So total tens 4's:40+80=120.\n\nHundreds place: floor(488/1000)=0 full thousands, but the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's:49+120+89=258.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: floor(488/10)=48 full groups, each contributing 1, plus if the last partial group (481-488) includes 8, which it does (488), so 48+1=49.\n\nTens place: floor(488/100)=4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, the remaining numbers are 400-488, which is 89 numbers. The tens digit cycles every 10, so floor(89/10)=8 full decades, each contributing 10, so 8*10=80. The last partial decade is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, and the tens digit is 8, so 9 occurrences. So total tens 8's:40+80+9=129. Wait, no, that's not right because the formula for tens place is floor((n+1)/100)*10 + (if the last partial group has tens digit >=8, then the count from 80 onwards). Wait, maybe I'm complicating it.\n\nAlternatively, for tens place 8's:\n\nFrom 1-399: each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 8:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389. So 4*10=40.\n\nFrom 400-488: the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo total tens 8's:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo difference:258-98=160.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo the correct answer is 160 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit's occurrence in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the Digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute 1 occurrence of 4.\n   - Total groups of 10: 48 (from 1 to 480), contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - Last partial group (481-488): 484 contributes 1.\n   - **Total units place 4's:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers contribute 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n   - From 1-399: 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - From 400-488: 8 full decades (400-409, ..., 470-479) \u00d7 10 = 80.\n   - **Total tens place 4's:** 40 + 80 = 120.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - **Total hundreds place 4's:** 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 120 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **258**.\n\n**Counting the Digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute 1 occurrence of 8.\n   - Total groups of 10: 48, contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - Last partial group (481-488): 488 contributes 1.\n   - **Total units place 8's:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers contribute 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n   - From 1-399: 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - From 400-488: 480-488 contributes 9 occurrences.\n   - **Total tens place 8's:** 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - **Total hundreds place 8's:** 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n258 (total 4's) - 98 (total 8's) = **160**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{160}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the best way to approach this is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have those counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, every 10 numbers will have exactly one 4 and one 8. So from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, there are 48 complete groups. Each of these groups contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So that would be 48 fours and 48 eights. But wait, after 480, we have 481 to 488, which is another 8 numbers. In these, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so there's another 4 (at 484) and another 8 (at 488). So in the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 + 1 = 49, and the number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. So the difference here is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 fours. Similarly, it's 8 for 80-89, another 10 eights. So for each hundred, there are 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. \n\nSince the book has 488 pages, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. Let's calculate the fours and eights in the tens place for each of these.\n\nFrom 1-100: 10 fours and 10 eights.\nFrom 101-200: Another 10 fours and 10 eights.\nFrom 201-300: Another 10 fours and 10 eights.\nFrom 301-400: Another 10 fours and 10 eights.\n\nSo that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 fours and 10 eights, totaling 40 fours and 40 eights.\n\nNow, looking at 401-488: The tens digit here is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., up to 8 for 481-490. Wait, but our book stops at 488, so the tens digit for 481-488 is 8, but only 8 numbers (481-488). So in the tens place, the number of 8's here is 8 (from 481-488), but the fours in the tens place would be from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 fours. So in the tens place for 401-488, we have 10 fours and 8 eights.\n\nAdding that to our previous total: fours in tens place = 40 + 10 = 50, and eights in tens place = 40 + 8 = 48. So the difference here is 50 - 48 = 2 more fours than eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. The fours in the tens place occur when the tens digit is 4, which is 440-449, that's 10 numbers, so 10 fours. The eights in the tens place occur when the tens digit is 8, which is 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, that's 9 numbers, so 9 eights, not 8. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So that's 9 eights in the tens place. So my earlier count was wrong; it's 9 eights, not 8.\n\nSo correcting that: in 401-488, tens place has 10 fours and 9 eights. So total fours in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, eights: 40 + 9 = 49. So the difference is 50 - 49 = 1 more four than eight in the tens place.\n\nHmm, I think I made a mistake earlier by counting 8 eights instead of 9. Let me correct that.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times, and the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So that's 89 fours and 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal fours = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal eights = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\nEvery 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4. Then, in the last partial decade, 481-488, the units digit is 4 at 484, so that's one more. So total 48 + 1 = 49 fours.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in units place: same logic, 48 + 1 = 49 eights. So units place difference is 0.\n\nTens place:\n- For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so in each hundred, 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place.\n- There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours and 10 eights, so 40 fours and 40 eights.\n- Now, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., 8 for 481-490. But since we stop at 488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So in the tens place, 4 occurs when the tens digit is 4, which is 440-449, that's 10 numbers. So in 401-488, tens place has 10 fours and 9 eights.\n- So total fours in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, eights: 40 + 9 = 49. So difference here is +1 for fours.\n\nHundreds place:\n- From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\nAdding up:\n- Fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- Eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n- Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference in tens place was +1, so 49+50+89=188 and 49+49=98, so 188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete groups of 10 in 488, contributing 48 each.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) add one more 4 and one more 8.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - Four complete hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 each.\n   - From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449 (10 4's) and 8 for 480-488 (9 8's).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, totaling 89 4's.\n   - No 8's appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by considering the positions of the digits: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll handle each place separately for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place**: I'll count how many times 4 appears in the units digit. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups and a partial group of 8 numbers. In each complete group, the units digit 4 appears once. So, 48 times. Then, in the partial group from 481 to 488, the units digit 4 appears once (at 484). So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place**: Now, I'll count how many times 4 appears in the tens digit. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit is 4 for numbers 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, from 101 to 200, it's 140-149, another 10 times, and so on. \n\nLet me calculate how many hundreds are there in 488. There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 times. \n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 times. \n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 401-488. So, yes, that's 10 more. \n\nSo total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: Now, the hundreds digit. This is only relevant when the page number is 100 or more. The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. \n\nHow many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. \n\nSo, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place**: Similar to the 4's, I'll count how many times 8 appears in the units digit. From 1 to 488, each group of 10 has one 8 in the units place. \n\n488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups and a partial group of 8 numbers. \n\nIn each complete group, units digit 8 appears once, so 48 times. In the partial group (481-488), units digit 8 appears once (at 488). So total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place**: Now, counting 8's in the tens digit. The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, etc. \n\nEach hundred has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. \n\nFrom 1-400, there are 4 complete hundreds. Each contributes 10 times the tens digit 8, so 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The tens digit 8 appears in 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit 8 never appears. Therefore, 0 times.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, 40+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place, 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus one more in 488, so 49. Correct.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place, since 488 is less than 800, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nSo total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier for 4's, I had 188. So, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's are 98. The difference would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, right? So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Then, tens and units as calculated.\n\nWait, but let me recount the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nNow, units place for 4's: 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus in the last group (481-488), 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nTens place for 4's: 400-488. The tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Plus, in each hundred before that, like 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 340-349. So, from 1-400, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? Each hundred contributes 10, so 4 hundreds would be 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, it's another 10 (440-449). So, 40 + 10 = 50. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nFor 8's, as I had before, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0, total 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9, not 10. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, yes, 9.\n\nAnother way to think about it: For the tens place, each hundred contributes 10 8's, except the last one if it's incomplete.\n\nSo, from 1-400, 4 hundreds, each with 10, so 40. Then, 401-488: the tens digit cycles through 0-8, so 8 appears once in each ten's place, but only up to 488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place, 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then 488, so 49. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so 188 - 98 = 90 more 4's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full groups of 10 (1-480) give 48 occurrences. The last group (481-488) adds 1 more, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences (e.g., 40-49), totaling 40 for 1-400. The last group (401-488) adds another 10 (440-449), totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 contribute 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full groups of 10 give 48 occurrences. The last page (488) adds 1, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences (e.g., 80-89), totaling 40 for 1-400. The last group (401-488) adds 9 (480-488), totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI remember that to count the number of times a specific digit appears, I need to look at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. So, I'll probably need to calculate how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and do the same for the digit 8, then subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4. I'll consider each place one by one.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, etc. Since the book has 488 pages, the units digit cycles from 1 to 9 repeatedly. To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide 488 by 10. That gives me 48 full cycles of 10, and then there's a remainder of 8 pages (since 488 = 48*10 + 8). In each full cycle, 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for a block of 100 numbers. For example, from 40 to 49, the tens digit is 4 for each of those 10 numbers. Similarly, this happens in every hundred block. So, from 1-100, 40-49 is 10 numbers; 101-200, 140-149 is another 10; 201-300, 240-249 is another 10; and 301-400, 340-349 is another 10. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit would be 4 for 400-409 and 410-419, but wait, 488 is the last page. Wait, actually, from 401 to 488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, then 1 for 411-420, and so on. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.\n\nThe tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers. How many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each of the first four hundreds, there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. That's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last 88 pages, from 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's would be 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n\nWait, but hold on, 401-488 is 88 pages, so 401-488 includes 400-488? No, 401-488 is 88 pages, so 401 is the first page of the 400s. So, in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, yes, that's correct, adding another 10, making it 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's would be units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems high, but let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the tens place. Let me recount. From 1-100: 40-49, that's 10. 101-200: 140-149, another 10. 201-300: 240-249, another 10. 301-400: 340-349, another 10. So, 4 hundreds, 10 each, that's 40. Then, 401-488: the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10. So, total 50. So, that's correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 full decades, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in the last 8 pages (481-488), units digits go up to 8, so 4 appears once. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems right.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, so 4's appear 188 times.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4's, for every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full cycles, each contributing 1, so 48 times. Then, the last 8 pages are 481-488, so the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For the tens digit, 8 appears in blocks of 100. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers. So, from 1-100: 80-89, that's 10. 101-200: 180-189, another 10. 201-300: 280-289, another 10. 301-400: 380-389, another 10. So, 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Now, in the last 88 pages, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them except 489, which isn't included. Wait, 480 is the first page, so 480-488 is 9 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, that's an additional 9. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 when the page number is between 480-488. So, 480, 481, ..., 488: that's 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 times. So, yes, adding 9 to the previous 40, making it 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's correct. So, 40 + 9 = 49 in the tens place, plus 49 in the units place, total 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 full decades (1-480) contribute 48, plus 481-488 has 484, which is one more, so 49.\n\n- Tens: 40 in the first four hundreds, plus 10 in 440-449, total 50.\n\n- Hundreds: 89 in 400-488.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 48 full decades, plus 488, so 49.\n\n- Tens: 40 in the first four hundreds, plus 9 in 480-488, total 49.\n\n- Hundreds: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI remember that to count the number of times a specific digit appears in a range, I can analyze each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. So, I'll need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place, and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. \n\nFirst, the units place: For every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then 8 extra pages. Each full block contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, in the 480-488 range, the units digit 4 appears once at 484. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times for the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place: Here, the digit 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers, specifically from 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 instances of the digit 4 in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there? Since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, we have blocks starting with 0 (which is just 1-99, but the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them all up: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, every block of 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full blocks of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, which is 48 times. Plus, in the 480-488 range, the units digit 8 appears once at 488. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times for the units place.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Each full block (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. How many such full blocks are there? From 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 8's, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. Then, the partial block 480-488 contributes 9 8's in the tens place (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them). Wait, no, actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for each, so that's 9 times. So, total in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding them up: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 times the digit 8 appears.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full blocks of 10, plus one in 484, total 49.\n- Tens: 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10, so 50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full blocks, plus one at 488, total 49.\n- Tens: 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each 10, so 40, plus 9 in 480-488, total 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.
