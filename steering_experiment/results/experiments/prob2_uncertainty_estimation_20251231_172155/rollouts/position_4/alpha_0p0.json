    "text": " That means the page numbers are 1-digit (1-9), two-digit (10-99), and three-digit (100-488).\n\nI guess I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place**: I need to count how many times 4 appears in the units place. For every set of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many such sets are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488). In each full set, there's one 4, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more. So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place**: Now, counting how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Every block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 4. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, the last block is 401-488. In this block, the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, 1 for 410-419, and so on up to 8 for 480-488. Wait, actually, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8, but the 4's in the tens place would be from 440-449. That's another 10 occurrences. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 more. So total 4's in tens place: 40 (from the first four blocks) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so 440-449 is fully included, right? Because 449 is less than 488. So yes, 10 more. So total 50.\n\nWait, but let me check: 401-488 is 88 numbers. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. Each ten's group has 10 numbers. So 440-449 is the group where the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers. So yes, 10 more, making it 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? That's when the page number is between 400 and 499. But since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So 188 4's.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's.\n\n1. **Units place**: Similar to 4's, but let's go through it. Every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many full sets of 10 are there? 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial set, 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once more. So total units place 8's: 48 +1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place**: Now, counting 8's in the tens place. Every block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 8. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Now, the last block is 401-488. In this block, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So the 8's in the tens place would be from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So that's 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, let me check: From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So yes, 9 more. So 40 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: Now, how many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? That would be when the page number is between 800 and 899, but the book only goes up to 488. So 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So 0.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, let me confirm the calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, seems correct. But let me check the tens place for 4's again. I had 50, but let me make sure. The first four blocks (1-400) each contribute 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more, making it 50. That's correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, in the last block (401-488), it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more, making it 49. Correct.\n\nYes, so the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, for the units place. In every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block, the digit 4 appears once and the digit 8 appears once. For example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, 4 appears once (at 4) and 8 appears once (at 8). \n\nNow, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then an extra 8 pages. So, in each of these 48 blocks, we have one 4 and one 8 in the units place. That gives 48 times 1 for 4's and 48 times 1 for 8's. \n\nBut wait, there's an extra 8 pages beyond the 480th page, which are pages 481 to 488. Let me check the units digit in this partial block. From 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). \n\nSo, for the units place, total 4's are 48 + 1 = 49, and total 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that's the same number, so the difference here is zero. Hmm, interesting. \n\nNext, let's move to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). In each set of 100 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in each 100-number block, and similarly, 8 appears 10 times.\n\nNow, how many full 100-number blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an additional 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each of these 4 blocks, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times in each block, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. \n\nNow, looking at the partial block from 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 401-410) to 8 (for 480-488). So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. \n\nIn the tens place, the digit 4 appears in the range 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times. The digit 8 appears in the range 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so 9 times. \n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 480-488). So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times, as I thought. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is included, but 480 is the start. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times for 8 in the tens place. \n\nTherefore, in the partial block, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times. \n\nAdding this to the full blocks: total tens digit 4's = 40 + 10 = 50, and total tens digit 8's = 40 + 9 = 49. \n\nWait, so in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times, so the difference here is 50 - 49 = 1. \n\nHmm, interesting. So, so far, the units place had equal counts, but the tens place gives a difference of 1 in favor of 4's. \n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, which we can ignore. \n\nFrom 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1. From 200-299, it's 2. From 300-399, it's 3. From 400-488, it's 4. \n\nSo, the hundreds digit 4 appears from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in the range 1-488, the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. There's no page number with 8 in the hundreds place because the book only has 488 pages, so 800-899 isn't included. Therefore, the hundreds digit 8 appears 0 times. \n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times, giving a difference of 89 - 0 = 89 in favor of 4's. \n\nNow, let me sum up the counts from each digit position:\n\n- Units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49 \u2192 difference 0\n- Tens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 49 \u2192 difference +1\n- Hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0 \u2192 difference +89\n\nTotal difference = 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nTotal number of units digits from 1-488: each digit 0-9 appears equally except possibly the last partial block. \n\nTotal number of complete blocks of 10: 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8). Each block contributes 1 four and 1 eight. So, 48 fours and 48 eights.\n\nThen, the last partial block is 481-488, which has 8 numbers. The units digits here are 1-8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 fours, 48 + 1 = 49 eights. So, difference 0. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach full hundred block contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4*10 = 40 fours and 40 eights.\n\nIn the partial hundred block 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. The fours in the tens place occur in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Eights in the tens place occur in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, 10 fours and 9 eights.\n\nTotal tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 fours, 40 + 9 = 49 eights. Difference +1.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 400-488, hundreds digit is 4. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours.\n\nNo eights in the hundreds place, as 800-899 isn't present. So, 0 eights.\n\nTotal hundreds place: 89 fours, 0 eights. Difference +89.\n\nAdding up the differences: 0 (units) +1 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can calculate the total number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract.\n\nTotal number of 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49\n\nTens place: 50\n\nHundreds place: 89\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal number of 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49\n\nTens place: 49\n\nHundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that matches. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For example, in the tens place, when I calculated the partial block from 401-488, I considered the tens digits. Let me confirm that.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 9 times, which I think is correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. That seems right.\n\nAnother way to check: let's count the number of 4's and 8's in each position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a formula or a more systematic approach.\n\nFor the units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's = floor(488 / 10) + (if the last digit is >=4, add 1). Wait, no, actually, the formula is a bit different. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: floor(n / 10). Each contributes 1 occurrence. Then, if the remainder (n mod 10) is >= d, add 1. But since d is 4, if the remainder is >=4, add 1.\n\nSo, for 488:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place = floor(488 / 10) = 48. Then, 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so add 1. So, 48 +1 =49. Similarly for 8's: floor(488/10)=48, and 488 mod10=8, which is equal to 8, so add 1. So, 48+1=49. So that's correct.\n\nFor the tens digit:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in tens place: floor(488 / 100) * 10 + extra.\n\nWait, the formula is a bit more involved. The number of times a digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to n is:\n\nLet higher = floor(n / 100)\n\ncurrent = (n / 10) mod 10\n\nlower = n mod 10\n\nIf current > d, count += (higher + 1) * 10\n\nIf current == d, count += (higher + 1) * 10 - (lower + 1)\n\nIf current < d, count += higher * 10\n\nSimilarly for 8's.\n\nWait, maybe this is a better approach.\n\nFor 4's in tens place:\n\nhigher = floor(488 / 100) = 4\n\ncurrent = (488 / 10) mod 10 = 8 mod 10 =8\n\nlower = 488 mod 10 =8\n\nSince current (8) > d (4), the count is (higher +1)*10 = (4+1)*10=50.\n\nSimilarly for 8's in tens place:\n\nhigher=4\n\ncurrent=8\n\nlower=8\n\nSince current (8) >= d (8), we have to check if current > d or ==.\n\nSince current == d, count = (higher +1)*10 - (lower +1) =5*10 - (8+1)=50 -9=41.\n\nWait, but earlier I calculated 49 for 8's in tens place. Hmm, this discrepancy suggests I might have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me re-examine.\n\nWait, according to this formula, the number of 8's in the tens place from 1 to 488 would be:\n\nhigher =4, current=8, lower=8.\n\nSince current == d, count = (higher +1)*10 - (lower +1) =5*10 -9=50-9=41.\n\nBut earlier, when I did it manually, I thought it was 49. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps my manual calculation was wrong. Let me recount.\n\nFrom 1-488, the tens digit 8 appears in the ranges:\n\n- 0-99: 80-89, which is 10 numbers\n- 100-199: 180-189, 10 numbers\n- 200-299: 280-289, 10 numbers\n- 300-399: 380-389, 10 numbers\n- 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers\n\nSo, total 10 +10 +10 +10 +9=49.\n\nBut according to the formula, it's 41. There's a discrepancy here. So, I must have made a mistake in applying the formula.\n\nWait, let me check the formula again. The formula is:\n\nFor digit d in the tens place:\n\ncount = higher * 10 + (if current > d, add 10; if current == d, add (lower +1); else add 0).\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied it earlier.\n\nWait, actually, the correct formula is:\n\nThe number of times digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to n is:\n\nhigher = floor(n / 100)\n\ncurrent = floor(n / 10) mod 10\n\nlower = n mod 10\n\nif current > d: count = (higher + 1) * 10\n\nif current == d: count = higher * 10 + (lower + 1)\n\nif current < d: count = higher * 10\n\nSo, for d=8 in the tens place, n=488:\n\nhigher =4, current=8, lower=8.\n\nSince current == d, count = higher *10 + (lower +1) =4*10 + (8+1)=40 +9=49.\n\nAh, that's correct. So, the formula gives 49, which matches my manual count. So, earlier when I thought the formula gave 41, I must have misapplied it.\n\nSimilarly, for d=4 in the tens place:\n\nhigher=4, current=8, lower=8.\n\nSince current > d (8>4), count=(higher +1)*10=(4+1)*10=50.\n\nWhich also matches my manual count.\n\nSo, that was a mistake in applying the formula earlier, but now it's clear.\n\nSo, the tens place gives 50 fours and 49 eights, difference +1.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place:\n\nFor d=4, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nFor d=8, since the book only goes up to 488, there's no hundreds digit 8, so 0 eights.\n\nSo, hundreds place: 89 fours, 0 eights, difference +89.\n\nAdding up:\n\nUnits: 49 fours, 49 eights \u2192 difference 0\n\nTens:50 fours,49 eights \u2192 difference +1\n\nHundreds:89 fours,0 eights \u2192 difference +89\n\nTotal difference: 0 +1 +89=90.\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nI think this makes sense. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss any other digit positions or make any miscalculations.\n\nYes, I considered units, tens, and hundreds places separately, applied the correct formula for each, and double-checked my work. So, I'm confident the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full blocks (1-480) and a partial block (481-488).\n   - Each block contributes 1 four and 1 eight, totaling 48 each.\n   - The partial block adds 1 four (484) and 1 eight (488).\n   - **Total Units Place:** 49 fours, 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 full blocks (1-400), contributing 40 fours and 40 eights.\n   - The partial block (401-488) has 10 fours (440-449) and 9 eights (480-488).\n   - **Total Tens Place:** 50 fours, 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, contributing 89 fours.\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total Hundreds Place:** 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\n4. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n   - **Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense. \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 occurrences. But wait, after 480, the next numbers are 481 to 488, which is 8 more numbers. In these, the units digit cycles from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 appears once more in 484. So, total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: from 0-488, the blocks would be 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does the block 440-449 go up to 449, and since the book goes up to 488, that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences.\n\nAdding up the 4's: Units (49) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, for every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, giving 48 8's. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more in 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let me count how many blocks there are. Starting from 0-488, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five blocks. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, so 4 blocks * 10 = 40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), so that's 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences here.\n\nAdding up the 8's: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, I subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't miss anything. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that looks correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full groups of 10 (48 occurrences) + 1 in 484 = 49.\n- **Tens place:** 5 blocks (40-49, etc.) \u00d7 10 = 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 numbers (400-488) = 89.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full groups of 10 (48 occurrences) + 1 in 488 = 49.\n- **Tens place:** 5 blocks (80-89, etc.) with the last block having 9 numbers = 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should start by counting how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me think about how to count the digits. Maybe I can separate the counting based on the number of digits in the page numbers. So, pages 1-9 are single-digit, 10-99 are two-digit, 100-488 are three-digit. I should handle each group separately.\n\nStarting with single-digit pages (1-9). The digits here are 1 through 9. So, how many 4's are there? Well, only page 4 has a 4. So that's one 4. Similarly, how many 8's? Only page 8. So that's one 8. So in single-digit pages, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. The difference so far is 0.\n\nNext, let's look at two-digit pages, which are from 10 to 99. Each two-digit number has a tens place and a ones place. I should consider each place separately.\n\nFirst, the tens place. For the tens digit, the numbers go from 1 to 9. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? That would be all the numbers from 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 appears in the tens place. Similarly, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? That would be from 80 to 89, which is also 10 numbers, so 10 times 8 appears.\n\nNow, the ones place. For the ones digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in each set of ten. So, in the ones place, how many times does 4 appear? From 10 to 99, for each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the ones place. There are 9 such groups (10-19 up to 90-99), so 9 times 4 appears in the ones place. Similarly, 8 appears once in each group's ones place, so 9 times 8 appears.\n\nWait, but hold on, from 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers, which is 9 groups of 10. So, yes, 9 times each digit in the ones place. So, for 4 in ones place: 9 times, and 8 in ones place: 9 times.\n\nSo, total for two-digit numbers:\n\n4's: tens place (10) + ones place (9) = 19\n8's: tens place (10) + ones place (9) = 19\n\nWait, that's interesting. So in two-digit pages, both 4 and 8 appear 19 times each. So the difference remains 0 so far.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit pages, which are from 100 to 488. These have hundreds, tens, and ones places. Let me break this down again by each digit place.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, let's see:\n\n- Hundreds digit is 1: pages 100-199\n- Hundreds digit is 2: pages 200-299\n- Hundreds digit is 3: pages 300-399\n- Hundreds digit is 4: pages 400-488\n\nNow, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Only in pages 400-488. So, that's 89 pages (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would be where 8 appears in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. For each hundred group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, in each hundred group, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.), except maybe the last group (400-488) which might not complete the full 10 numbers.\n\nWait, let's check each group:\n\n1. 100-199: The tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (140-149, etc.)\n2. 200-299: Similarly, 10 times.\n3. 300-399: 10 times.\n4. 400-488: The tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for the tens digit 4, the pages would be 440-449. That's 10 pages, so 10 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place across all three-digit numbers: 10 (from 100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:\n\n1. 100-199: 180-189 is the tens digit 8, so 10 times.\n2. 200-299: 280-289, 10 times.\n3. 300-399: 380-389, 10 times.\n4. 400-488: The tens digit 8 would be pages 480-488. Wait, that's only 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 pages. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nNow, the ones place in three-digit numbers. Again, for each hundred group, the ones digit cycles 0-9 every page. So, in each hundred group, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the ones place, and similarly for 8.\n\nBut let's check each group:\n\n1. 100-199: For each ten's group, the ones digit 4 appears once. There are 10 ten's groups, so 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times.\n2. 200-299: Same as above, 10 times each.\n3. 300-399: Same, 10 times each.\n4. 400-488: Now, here, the ones digit cycles from 0-9, but only up to page 488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the ones place? Let's see: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times because 494 would be beyond 488. Wait, no, 404 is within 400-488, so let me count:\n\nFrom 400 to 488, the ones digit cycles 0-9 every 10 pages. So, starting at 400, the ones digits go 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, then repeat. But since 488 is the last page, let's see how many complete cycles there are.\n\nFrom 400 to 488 is 89 pages. 89 divided by 10 is 8 full cycles (80 pages) and 9 remaining pages. In each full cycle, the ones digit 4 appears once, so 8 times. Then, in the remaining 9 pages (480-488), the ones digits are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, the ones digit 4 appears once more. So total 8 + 1 = 9 times for 4 in the ones place in 400-488.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the ones place in 400-488:\n\nIn each full cycle of 10, 8 appears once. So 8 times in the full cycles (400-479), and in the remaining 9 pages (480-488), the ones digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once. So total 8 + 1 = 9 times.\n\nWait, but wait, in 400-488, the ones digit 8 appears at 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 times, yes.\n\nSo, for the ones place in three-digit numbers:\n\n4's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\n8's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So in the ones place, both 4 and 8 appear 39 times each in the three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, let me summarize the counts:\n\nSingle-digit:\n- 4: 1\n- 8: 1\n\nTwo-digit:\n- 4: 19\n- 8: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n- 4: hundreds (89) + tens (40) + ones (39) = 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n- 8: hundreds (0) + tens (39) + ones (39) = 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nWait, let me check that again. For three-digit numbers:\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488)\n- 8 appears 0 times\n\nTens place:\n- 4 appears 40 times (10 each in 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 10 in 400-488)\n- 8 appears 39 times (10 each in 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 9 in 400-488)\n\nOnes place:\n- 4 appears 39 times (10 each in 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 9 in 400-488)\n- 8 appears 39 times (same as above)\n\nSo, adding up:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (ones) = 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (ones) = 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, in three-digit numbers, for 4's:\n\nHundreds: 89\nTens: 40\nOnes: 39\nTotal: 89 + 40 = 129, 129 + 39 = 168\n\nFor 8's:\n\nHundreds: 0\nTens: 39\nOnes: 39\nTotal: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nAdding single and two-digit counts:\n\n4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) separately and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by analyzing each digit position one by one.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in every block of ten numbers, each digit (including 4 and 8) appears exactly once in the units place. \n\nSo, how many complete blocks of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 numbers (481 to 488). \n\nIn each complete block, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48, and the number of 8's is also 48. But wait, we also have the partial block from 481 to 488. Let's check those numbers:\n\n481: units digit is 1\n482: 2\n483: 3\n484: 4 (so that's one more 4)\n485: 5\n486: 6\n487: 7\n488: 8 (one more 8)\n\nSo in the partial block, we have one more 4 and one more 8. Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both digits appear the same number of times.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place for each hundred.\n\nSo, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 40-49. So that's 10 times per hundred. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred as well (80-89).\n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, we have four complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred from 401-488.\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so for four hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times per hundred, so 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, let's check the partial hundred from 401-488. The tens digit here goes from 0 (for 401-409) up to 8 (for 480-488). So, the digit 4 in the tens place would be from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's 10 more 4's. Similarly, the digit 8 in the tens place is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. Wait, let me confirm: 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in this partial hundred.\n\nSo, adding up, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 40 (from the four complete hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. And the total number of 8's in the tens place is 40 (from the four complete hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times. So, 4 is ahead by 1 here.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit changes every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0 (but since we're starting from page 1, maybe we can ignore the leading zero). From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, from 200-299 it's 2, and so on.\n\nIn our case, the book has 488 pages, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4 (for pages 400-488). So, let's see how many times each digit appears in the hundreds place.\n\nThe digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. That's 89 pages (from 400 to 488 inclusive). Wait, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about the digit 8? Well, in the hundreds place, 8 would appear from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8 in this book. Therefore, the digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. That's a significant difference.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit across all positions.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n- Each ten has one 4 and one 8. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both digits. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (40-49) and 10 where it's 8 (80-89). So, four hundreds would give 4*10=40 each. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 times. The tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 times. So, 40 +10=50 for 4, and 40 +9=49 for 8. That adds up.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times. 8 never appears here because the book doesn't go beyond 488. So, 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nAdding up:\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place. Let me think again: pages 400-488 are 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 in all of them. So, 89 times. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should count the number of times each digit appears in each position more carefully.\n\nAnother approach: for each position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n- For each digit from 0-9, it appears equally in the units place except possibly the last partial set.\n- Number of complete sets of 10: floor(488 / 10) = 48. Each contributes one 4 and one 8.\n- Remaining pages: 488 % 10 = 8. So, pages 481-488: check units digits 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484), 8 appears once (488).\n- Total units: 48 +1 =49 for both.\n\nTens place:\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred for the tens place.\n- Number of complete hundreds: floor(488 / 100) =4. So, 4*10=40 for each digit in the tens place.\n- Remaining pages: 488 - 400 =88. So, in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles 0-8.\n- For digit 4 in tens place: occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times.\n- For digit 8 in tens place: occurs in 480-488, which is 9 times.\n- So, total tens place: 40 +10=50 for 4, and 40 +9=49 for 8.\n\nHundreds place:\n- From 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, but we don't count leading zeros, so 0 times.\n- From 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so 100 times.\n- From 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, 100 times.\n- From 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, 100 times.\n- From 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, 89 times.\n- So, digit 4 appears 89 times in hundreds place, and 8 never appears.\n\nSo, adding up:\n4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 188\n8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98\nDifference: 188 -98 =90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers is 188, while the digit 8 appears 98 times.

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) separately and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4. \n\nFirst, looking at the units place. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1 to 10, it's page 4; from 11 to 20, it's page 14, and so on. So I can calculate how many full blocks of 10 there are in 488 pages. \n\n488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks of 10, and then 8 extra numbers. Each full block contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial block (481 to 488), I check if there's a 4 in the units place. The numbers are 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So page 484 has a 4 in the units place. That's one more. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers, with each digit appearing 10 times in a block of 100. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit is 4 for pages 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, from 101 to 200, it's 140-149, another 10 times, and so on. \n\nSo let's see how many hundreds are in 488. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each full hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So 4 hundreds would contribute 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is another 10 times. So that's 10 more. So total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but let me check: 401-488 includes 401 to 488. The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So yes, that's correct. So total tens place 4's are 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So that's 89 times.\n\nWait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488. So from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 times.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So total 4's are 188.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Again, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 8 in the units place. So 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit is 8 on page 488. So that's one more. So total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each such block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. \n\nSo how many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these has one block where the tens digit is 8, contributing 10 times. So that's 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nThen, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So that's 9 times.\n\nSo total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check: 401-488 includes 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So yes, 9 times. So 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in pages 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place 8's are 0.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For the tens place, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 starting at 480, which is within 401-488. So 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So yes, 49 for tens.\n\nSo total 8's are 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing 1, so 48, plus 1 in 484, total 49.\n\n- Tens: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40, plus 10 in 440-449, total 50.\n\n- Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48, plus 1 in 488, total 49.\n\n- Tens: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40, plus 9 in 480-488, total 49.\n\n- Hundreds: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? It's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So yes, each of those 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place in 4's, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nFor the tens place in 8's, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nSo yes, the total 4's are 188, and 8's are 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When counting the tens place for 4's, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place, 488 is included, so 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's correct.\n\nI think my calculations are accurate. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full blocks of 10 (480 occurrences) + 1 in the last block = 49\n- **Tens place:** 4 full hundreds (40 occurrences) + 10 in the last partial hundred = 50\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488)\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full blocks of 10 (48 occurrences) + 1 in the last block = 49\n- **Tens place:** 4 full hundreds (40 occurrences) + 9 in the last partial hundred = 49\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, the page numbers will be from 1 to 9 (one-digit), 10 to 99 (two-digit), 100 to 488 (three-digit). \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. \n\nHow many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). So, in each of the 48 blocks, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8, so no 4 there. So, total 4's in the units place: 48.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 in the tens place occurs in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. \n\nHow many such blocks are there? Since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, but page numbers start at 1, so the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, and so on up to 4 for 400-488. \n\nSo, for the tens place, the digit 4 appears in the 40-49 block, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, I should check if the last block, 440-449, is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488, so all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 in the hundreds place occurs in the numbers from 400 to 488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: Units (48) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, in every block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. \n\nHow many such blocks are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks and 8 extra numbers. Each block contributes one 8, so 48 times. Now, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more 8. So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. \n\nHow many such blocks are there? Since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, for each hundreds digit, there's a block of 10 where the tens digit is 8. That's 5 blocks (0,1,2,3,4), each contributing 10 8's. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, does the last block, 480-489, fall within 488? 480-488 is part of the block, but 489 is beyond 488, so only 9 numbers (480-488) have 8 in the tens place. So, for the hundreds digit 4, the tens digit 8 occurs only 9 times, not 10. \n\nSo, the first four blocks (0,1,2,3) each have 10 8's, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. The last block (4) has 9 8's. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would occur in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's here.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 48 full blocks, each giving one 8, plus the last partial block giving one more 8 (488), so 49. Tens place: For hundreds digits 0,1,2,3, each gives 10 8's, that's 4\u00d710=40, and for hundreds digit 4, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's, totaling 49. So, yes, 49 in units and 49 in tens, total 98 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 488 is included in the units place count, so that's correct. Now, the hundreds place: Since the book ends at 488, there are no page numbers from 800 onwards, so no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 there.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was counting 4's, I got 187, and 8's as 98. So, the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the counts.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 48 times.\n\nTens place: 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each with 10 4's, so 5\u00d710=50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full blocks (1-480), each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 has an 8, adding 1 more, so 49.\n\nTens place: For hundreds digits 0,1,2,3, each has a block of 10 where tens digit is 8, so 4\u00d710=40. For hundreds digit 4, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0, as no page numbers are 800-899.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes it's easy to miscount.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a formula or a more systematic approach.\n\nFor counting digit occurrences, a common method is to consider each digit position separately and calculate the number of times a digit appears.\n\nLet's formalize this.\n\nFor a given digit d and position p (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times d appears can be calculated as follows.\n\nLet me denote the current position as the rightmost digit (units), then tens, then hundreds.\n\nFor each position, we can split the number into higher, current, and lower digits.\n\nFor example, for the number ABC (a three-digit number), A is the hundreds digit, B is the tens, and C is the units.\n\nThe formula for the number of times a digit d appears in position p is:\n\ncount = higher * 10^p\n\nif current > d: count += 10^p\n\nif current == d: count += (lower + 1)\n\nBut this is a bit more involved. Alternatively, for each position, we can compute how many times each digit appears.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to use this formula for each digit place.\n\nBut perhaps for simplicity, since the number isn't too large (488), I can compute each digit place separately.\n\nLet me try this approach again.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's.\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place from 1 to 488.\n\nEvery 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place. So, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no additional 4's. So, total 4's in units place: 48.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of 4's in tens place. Each block of 100 contributes 10 4's in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, how many such blocks are there in 488? Since 488 is less than 500, there are 5 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but the last block is only up to 488, so in the tens place, how many 4's are there?\n\nFor each block of 100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9, so each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for each block of 100, there are 10 4's in the tens place. However, for the last block (400-488), the tens digit can go up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in the tens place for 400-488, the digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. So, total tens place 4's: 4 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contribute 10 4's, so 4\u00d710=40, plus the 10 from 400-488, totaling 50.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is the fifth block, so 5 blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5\u00d710=50. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's in hundreds place. This occurs when the hundreds digit is 4, which is from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\nNow, counting the 8's.\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of 8's in units place from 1 to 488.\n\nEvery 10 numbers contribute one 8 in the units place. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 has an 8, adding one more. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of 8's in tens place. Each block of 100 contributes 10 8's in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). How many such blocks are there in 488? Since 488 is less than 500, there are 5 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). For each block except the last one, the tens digit 8 appears in 10 numbers. For the last block (400-488), the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 from the last block, totaling 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of 8's in hundreds place. This would be from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer was 89, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me verify once more.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense. \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I'll calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every set of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. \n\nNow, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then an extra 8 pages. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times (once in each block of 10) plus any additional 4's in the last partial block. Let's check the last 8 pages: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, there's one more 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, in each block of 10, it appears once, so 48 times, plus in the last partial block, 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that's the same as 4's. Hmm, that's interesting. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in a block of 100. For example, from 1-100, the tens digits go from 0 (for 1-9) and then 1 (11-19), 2 (21-29), etc., up to 9 (91-99). So, in each block of 100, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. \n\nHow many full blocks of 100 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial block from 401-488.\n\nIn each full block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 4 times 10 is 40. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place in each block (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4 times 10 is 40.\n\nNow, in the partial block from 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. Let's see, 401-410: tens digit is 0, 411-420: 1, 421-430: 2, 431-440: 3, 441-450: 4, 451-460: 5, 461-470: 6, 471-480:7, 481-490:8, but wait, we only go up to 488, so 481-488: tens digit is 8, which is 8 numbers. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in this partial block?\n\nLooking at 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, but wait, our partial block is from 401-488, so 441-450 is entirely within that. So, 10 times. Wait, but 441-450 is 10 numbers, but 488 is beyond 450, so actually, 441-450 is entirely within 401-488, so 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 occurs in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me double-check. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but only up to 488). So, in the tens place, 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 times, and 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 times. So, adding to the previous counts, the total for 4 in the tens place is 40 (from the 4 full blocks) + 10 = 50, and for 8, it's 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 48 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, in the hundreds place, each digit from 1 to 4 appears, since the book has 488 pages. Let's see:\n\n- Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (but we don't count 0 as a digit here, I think).\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1.\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2.\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3.\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, how many times does 4 appear? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in the range 800-899, the hundreds digit is 8, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, the count for 8 in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. To find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract 97 from 188.\n\n188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place for 4: 49\nTens place for 4: 50\nHundreds place for 4: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nUnits place for 8: 49\nTens place for 8: 48\nHundreds place for 8: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nYes, that seems right. So, there are 91 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers is 188, and the digit 8 appears 97 times. The difference is 91.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting 4's:**\n   - **Units Place:** Each block of 10 pages has one 4. There are 48 full blocks (480 pages) and one extra page (484). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** Each block of 100 pages has 10 4's. There are 4 full blocks (400 pages) and in the last 88 pages (401-488), 441-450 gives another 10. So, 4\u00d710 + 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** Pages 400-488 have 89 pages with 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting 8's:**\n   - **Units Place:** Each block of 10 pages has one 8. There are 48 full blocks and 488 adds one more. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** Each block of 100 pages has 10 8's. There are 4 full blocks, and in the last 88 pages, 481-488 gives 8. So, 4\u00d710 + 8 = 48.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No 8's appear here as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{91}"

Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense. \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each place one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** I need to count how many times 4 appears in the units digit. The units digits cycle every 10 numbers: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. So in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, 4 appears exactly once in the units place. \n\n   So, from page 1 to page 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). In each complete block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (484). So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, how about the tens digit? The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 00-09, 10-19, ..., 90-99. In each of these blocks, the tens digit is 4 exactly 10 times (40-49). \n\n   So, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 numbers (401-488). \n\n   In each complete hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (40-49), so 4 times 10 is 40. \n\n   Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles again. Let's see, from 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; and so on. Wait, actually, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is 4-8-8). So, in this partial block, the tens digit is 4 once, from 440-449, which is 10 pages. So that's another 10. \n\n   Wait, but 488 is less than 490, so does 440-449 fall within 401-488? Yes, because 440 is less than 488. So, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times in this partial block as well. \n\n   So total tens place 4's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from partial hundred) = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? \n\n   From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. \n\n   Wait, but page numbers start at 1, so 400 is page 400, and 488 is page 488. So, yes, that's 89 times. \n\n   But wait, in page numbers, the hundreds digit is only present when the page is 100 or more. So, for pages 1-99, there's no hundreds digit. So, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488, which is 89 pages. \n\n   So, hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's printed: 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** Counting how many times 8 appears in the units digit. Similar to 4, in every block of 10, 8 appears once. \n\n   From 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10? 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 8 appears once more (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, tens digit 8. This occurs in the range 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488.\n\n   Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\n   - From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 pages.\n   - From 100-199: 180-189 is 10 pages.\n   - From 200-299: 280-289 is 10 pages.\n   - From 300-399: 380-389 is 10 pages.\n   - From 400-488: 480-488 is 9 pages (since 488 is the last page).\n\n   So, adding these up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n   Wait, but let me double-check. Each hundred block except the last one has 10 pages with tens digit 8, so 4 blocks give 40. Then, the last partial block (400-488) has 480-488, which is 9 pages. So total is 40 + 9 = 49. That matches.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, hundreds digit 8. This occurs from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800 or above, but since 488 < 800, there are no pages where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 49 + 49 is 98, but let me check again. Units place 8's: 49, tens place 8's: 49, hundreds place 8's: 0. So total 8's: 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's and 8's.\n\nWait, when I counted the 4's in the tens place, I considered 400-488 as a partial block. From 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 pages. So that's correct, adding 10 to the tens place count. So, 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50. That's correct.\n\nFor the 8's in the tens place, I considered each hundred block up to 400-488, giving 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me recount the 8's in the tens place. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10. 100-199: 180-189 is 10. 200-299: 280-289 is 10. 300-399: 380-389 is 10. 400-488: 480-488 is 9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nNow, checking the 4's in the hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nWait, but when I add up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just check if I counted correctly in the units place for both digits.\n\nFor 4's in units place: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units digit? Every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once more (484). So total 49. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in units place: same logic, 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 8 appears once (488). So total 49. Correct.\n\nAnother way to check: the number of times a digit appears in the units place from 1 to N can be calculated as (N // 10) + (1 if the units digit of N is >= the target digit else 0). Wait, but actually, it's (N // 10) + (1 if (N % 10) >= target digit else 0). Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Because if the target digit is less than the units digit, you add 1; otherwise, you don't. Wait, maybe I should think differently.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think that for each digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place from 1 to N is (N // 10) * 1 + min(max(N % 10 - d + 1, 0), 1). Hmm, perhaps. Let me test with N=488 and d=4.\n\nN=488, d=4.\n\nN//10 = 48, so 48 times. Then, N%10=8. So, how many numbers from 1 to 488 have units digit >=4? Wait, no, actually, for units digit d, the count is (N//10) + (1 if (N%10) >= d else 0). So for d=4, it's 48 + 1=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly for d=8: 48 + 1=49. Correct.\n\nSo, units place counts are correct.\n\nNow, for the tens place, let's use a similar approach.\n\nFor digit d in the tens place, the count is calculated as follows:\n\nFor each hundred block, the tens digit cycles 0-9, each appearing 10 times. So, the number of complete hundreds is N//100. For each complete hundred, the digit d appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nThen, for the remaining part (N % 100), if the tens digit is >=d, then add (N % 100 - (d*10) + 1). If the tens digit is less than d, then add 0.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute as:\n\nNumber of times d appears in the tens place = (N // 100) * 10 + (if the tens digit of N is >= d, then min(N % 100 - d*10 + 1, 10), else 0).\n\nWait, let me test this with N=488 and d=4.\n\nN//100 = 4 (since 488//100=4). So, 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nNow, N % 100 = 88. The tens digit is 8. Since 8 >=4, we add min(88 - 40 +1, 10). Wait, 88 - 40 is 48, +1 is 49. But min(49,10) is 10. So total is 40 +10=50. Correct, as we had before.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8 in the tens place:\n\nN//100=4, so 4*10=40.\n\nN%100=88, tens digit=8. Since 8>=8, add min(88 - 80 +1, 10) = min(9,10)=9. So total is 40 +9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, that's a good check.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds place:\n\nFor digit d in the hundreds place, the count is (N // 1000) * 100 + (if the hundreds digit of N is >=d, then min(N - d*100 +1, 100), else 0).\n\nBut in our case, N=488, so N//1000=0. The hundreds digit is 4. So, for d=4, we add min(488 - 400 +1, 100) = min(89,100)=89. So, total hundreds place 4's: 89. Correct.\n\nFor d=8 in hundreds place: since 4 <8, we don't add anything. So, 0. Correct.\n\nSo, all counts seem accurate.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488. \n\n1. **Counting 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** 50 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 89 times.\n   - Total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** 49 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 0 times.\n   - Total 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Then, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. Let's see, in every block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4), and 8 appears once (page 8). \n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra pages. So, in the units place, for each complete block, 4 and 8 each appear once. Therefore, in 48 blocks, 4 appears 48 times, and 8 appears 48 times. \n\nThen, we have the extra 8 pages: 481 to 488. Let's check the units digits here. The units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these extra pages, the digit 4 appears once (page 484), and the digit 8 appears once (page 488). \n\nSo, for the units place, total 4's are 48 (from blocks) + 1 (extra) = 49. Total 8's are 48 (from blocks) + 1 (extra) = 49. So, in the units place, 4's and 8's are equal. \n\nMoving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, it appears 10 times in each block of 100 (like 40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (like 80-89). \n\nHow many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 extra pages (401-488). \n\nIn each of the 4 complete blocks, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so 4 x 10 = 40 times. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times per block, so 4 x 10 = 40 times. \n\nNow, in the extra 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. Let's see, the tens digit goes from 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), up to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, in the 400-409 range, the tens digit is 0, so no. Wait, actually, in the 400-409 block, the tens digit is 0, so 4 doesn't appear in the tens place here. Wait, no, the tens digit is 0, so 4 in the tens place would be in 440-449, but wait, 401-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 pages where the tens digit is 4. Similarly, for 8, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488), but actually, 480-489 would be 10 pages, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 9 pages. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488), so the tens digit is 8 for these 9 pages. \n\nWait, let me clarify. For the tens digit in 401-488: the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) to 8 (480-488). So, in the 400-409 range, the tens digit is 0, so no 4's there. Then, in the 410-419 range, the tens digit is 1, so again no 4's. Similarly, 420-429: tens digit 2, no 4's. 430-439: tens digit 3, no 4's. 440-449: tens digit 4, so here 4 appears 10 times (440-449). Then, 450-459: tens digit 5, no 4's. 460-469: tens digit 6, no 4's. 470-479: tens digit 7, no 4's. 480-488: tens digit 8, which is 9 times (from 480 to 488 inclusive). \n\nSo, in the extra 88 pages, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and the tens digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488). \n\nTherefore, total 4's in the tens place: 4 blocks x 10 = 40, plus 10 in the extra pages, totaling 50. \n\nTotal 8's in the tens place: 4 blocks x 10 = 40, plus 9 in the extra pages, totaling 49. \n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's are 50, and 8's are 49. So, 4's are one more than 8's here.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit cycles every 1000 numbers, but since our book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit can only be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. \n\nWait, actually, page numbers from 1-99 have no hundreds digit, so the hundreds digit is 0. From 100-199, hundreds digit is 1. From 200-299, it's 2. From 300-399, it's 3. From 400-488, it's 4. \n\nSo, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears from page 400 to 488. How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in the range 1-488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, the count for 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, total 4's in the hundreds place: 89. Total 8's: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 488 pages. Each 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, 48 complete blocks of 10, which is 48*10=480 pages. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488). In the units place of these, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units: 48+1=49 for 4, 48+1=49 for 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each 100 pages, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) give 4*10=40 each. Then, the extra 88 pages (401-488). In these, 440-449 is 10 pages with tens digit 4, so 10 more 4's. 480-488 is 9 pages with tens digit 8, so 9 more 8's. So, total 4's in tens: 40+10=50, 8's: 40+9=49. That seems right.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 4's. 8 never appears in hundreds place, so 0. Correct.\n\nAdding up: 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188. 8's: 49 +49 +0=98. Difference: 188-98=90. So, 4's are printed 90 times more than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 pages. So, 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAnd in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 times 8 in the tens place. Correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, when I was counting the extra pages, I considered 401-488, which is 88 pages. But when I broke it down, 440-449 is 10 pages, and 480-488 is 9 pages. So, 10+9=19, but the extra pages are 88, so maybe I made a mistake in how I broke it down.\n\nWait, no, because 401-488 is 88 pages, but when I'm looking at the tens digit, it's not just the last 88 pages. The tens digit cycles every 10 pages, so in 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (400-409) to 8 (480-488). So, within 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but 401-409 is part of the 400-409 block, which is within the 401-488 range. So, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages, and tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, that's correct. The total extra tens digits are 10 for 4 and 9 for 8, which adds up to 19, but since the extra pages are 88, that's okay because the tens digit changes every 10 pages.\n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the difference is 90.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, and hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks of 10 in 488 pages, contributing 48 each.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) contribute one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - Total 4's: \\(48 + 1 = 49\\)\n   - Total 8's: \\(48 + 1 = 49\\)\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 pages contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 complete blocks of 100 in 488 pages, contributing 40 each.\n   - The remaining 88 pages (401-488) contribute 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: \\(40 + 10 = 50\\)\n   - Total 8's: \\(40 + 9 = 49\\)\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages.\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n\nSumming up the counts:\n- Total 4's: \\(49 + 50 + 89 = 188\\)\n- Total 8's: \\(49 + 49 + 0 = 98\\)\n\nThe difference between the number of 4's and 8's is:\n\\[ 188 - 98 = 90 \\]\n\nThus, the number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\(\\boxed{90}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the different positions where the digits can appear: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll handle each digit position separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers, like 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many times does this happen? Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, I can calculate the number of times 4 appears in the units place by dividing 488 by 10, which gives me 48 full cycles, and then there's a remainder of 8. So, in each cycle, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 times, and then in the last partial cycle from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again. So, units place gives me 48 fours.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the digit 4 in the tens place occurs in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, there are 4 complete blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349) and then a partial block from 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is actually within 488, so that's another full block. Wait, no, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 blocks * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. So, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 in the hundreds place occurs from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.\n\nNow, adding up all the fours: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 fours in total.\n\nWait, let me double-check the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's indeed 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. Okay, that seems right.\n\nNow, moving on to the digit 8:\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48 full cycles, and the remainder is 8, which includes 888, but wait, 488 is the last page. So, in each cycle, 8 appears once in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial cycle, from 481 to 488, the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that. If I do 488 divided by 10, that's 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48. Then, the last partial cycle is 481-488, which includes 488, so the units digit is 8 once more. So, 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is a partial block because the book ends at 488. So, each full block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count the number of full blocks:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: Here, the tens digit is 8, but the numbers go from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, each of these contributes an 8, so that's 9 eights.\n\nSo, the first four blocks are full, each giving 10 eights, so 4*10=40. The last block gives 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me confirm: from 80-89: 10 eights in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: each 10. Then 480-488: 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place occurs from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the eights: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so total eights are 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place calculation. When I have 480-488, that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, 9 eights. So, 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, etc.) plus 9 in the last partial block, totaling 49. That seems correct.\n\nNow, so total fours are 187, and total eights are 98. The question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 89 more fours than eights.\n\nBut wait, let me think again about the units place for fours. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many terms? The last term is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Wait, so that would be 49 times, not 48. Wait, did I make a mistake earlier?\n\nWait, earlier I thought units place fours were 48, but now I'm seeing it should be 49. Because 484 is the last one, which is 484, which is 48*10 +4, so that's the 49th occurrence.\n\nWait, so maybe I made a mistake in the units place for fours. Let me recalculate.\n\nNumber of fours in units place: The numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. So, the nth term is 10n -6, where n starts at 1. Wait, 4 is 10*1 -6 = 4, 14 is 10*2 -6 =14, etc. So, the last term is 484, which is 10n -6 = 484. So, 10n = 490, so n=49. So, there are 49 fours in the units place. So, I think I made a mistake earlier, it's 49, not 48.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place of eights: 8,18,28,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, (488 -8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, units place eights:49.\n\nWait, so in my initial calculation, I thought units place fours were 48, but actually, it's 49. So, that changes the total fours.\n\nLet me recalculate the fours:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal fours:49 +50=99; 99 +89=188.\n\nWait, so that's 188 fours.\n\nAnd eights:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal eights:49 +49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, so I had an error in the units place for fours, which was 49 instead of 48. So, the total fours went from 187 to 188, making the difference 90 instead of 89.\n\nWait, let me check again. So, units place fours:49, tens place:50, hundreds:89. So, 49+50=99, +89=188.\n\nEights:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nHmm, so the correct answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake elsewhere. Let me go through each digit place again.\n\n**Fours:**\n\n1. Units place:\nNumbers:4,14,24,...,484.\nHow many terms? The first term is 4, the last is 484. The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10=484.\nSo, 4 +10(n-1)=484 =>10(n-1)=480 =>n-1=48 =>n=49. So, 49 fours in units place.\n\n2. Tens place:\nEach block of 100 numbers has a block where tens digit is 4, e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.\nFrom 1-488, how many such blocks?\n\n- 40-49:10\n- 140-149:10\n- 240-249:10\n- 340-349:10\n- 440-449:10\nSo, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10=50.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\nFrom 400-488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers? 488 -400 +1=89.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188.\n\n**Eights:**\n\n1. Units place:\nNumbers:8,18,28,...,488.\nNumber of terms: first term 8, last term 488. nth term:8 +10(n-1)=488 =>10(n-1)=480 =>n-1=48 =>n=49. So, 49 eights.\n\n2. Tens place:\nBlocks where tens digit is 8:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488.\n\n- 80-89:10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page)\nTotal:4*10 +9=49.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\nFrom 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so 0.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference:188-98=90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each full block contributes 10, and the last block contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - More 4's than 8's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each place for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each set of 10, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. \n\nNow, how many such groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10 and then an extra 8 pages. Wait, no, actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that would be 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, and then the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488) would contribute an additional 4 and 8 in the units place. Let me check that.\n\nWait, actually, 488 is the last page. So from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? It's 48 complete groups because 48*10=480, and then 481 to 488 is the 49th group, but it's incomplete. So, for the units place, each complete group of 10 contributes one 4 and one 8. So, 48 groups would contribute 48 4's and 48 8's in the units place.\n\nNow, in the incomplete group from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this group, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). Therefore, in the units place, total 4's are 48 + 1 = 49, and total 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. So, the units place contributes equally to both digits, 49 each.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, it appears 10 times in each 100 numbers, same for 8.\n\nBut wait, in our case, the book has 488 pages, so we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. So, let me calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nFirst, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times. There are 4 full hundreds, so 4*10=40 for both 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, the incomplete hundred from 401 to 488. The tens digits here go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see: from 440 to 449, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 480 to 488, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 480 to 488 is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, let me make sure. From 401 to 488, the tens digits go 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-488). So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which is only 8 times because 488 is the end. Wait, no, 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times. Hmm, but actually, each tens digit from 0 to 8 in 401-488 appears 10 times except for the last one. Wait, no, that's not correct because 488 is the last page, so the tens digit 8 only goes up to 488, which is 8 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in 481-488. But wait, 480 is part of the previous hundred, right? So, 480 is in 401-488, but 480 is the last page of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, 480 is included. So, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, which is 9 pages: 480,481,...,488. Wait, no, 480 is the first page of the 480-489 set, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in 480-488. Therefore, in the incomplete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and the tens digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488). \n\nSo, in the tens place, total 4's are 4*10 (from the four full hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. Wait, no, wait: in each full hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then, in the incomplete hundred, 440-449 adds another 10, so total 50. For 8's, in each full hundred, it's 10 times, so 4*10=40, and in the incomplete hundred, 480-488 adds 9, so total 49. Therefore, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Each full hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 occurrences of each tens digit, including 4 and 8. So, 4 full hundreds give 4*10=40 for both 4 and 8. Then, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, total 4's in tens place: 40+10=50, and 8's: 40+9=49. So, in the tens place, 4's are 50, 8's are 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 1 for 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is part of the 400-499 range, but since we only go up to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 times. \n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit never reaches 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, let me verify my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- 488 divided by 10 is 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each.\n- The remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n- So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nTens place:\n- Each full hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. 4 full hundreds give 40 each.\n- In the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times.\n- The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times.\n- So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50\n- Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up:\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me check again. The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. How many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: from 1-399, the hundreds digit is 1,2,3, so 4 doesn't appear in the hundreds place until 400. So, 400-488 is 89 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times.\n\nSo, yes, the total 4's are 188 and 8's are 98, so 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), 2-digit (10-99), or 3-digit (100-488).\n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times 8 appears, then find the difference between the two counts.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nFirst, for the units place. In the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 10, 4 appears once (page 4). From 11 to 20, 4 appears once (page 14), and so on. So, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups and an extra 8 pages. In each complete group, 4 appears once in the units place. So, that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, 484 would have a 4 in the units place. That's one more. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. Similarly, in the tens digit, 4 appears in a block of 100 pages, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? Well, up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, but page numbers start at 1, so the first block is 40-49, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, let me check: 40-49 is the first block, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks, each with 10 pages, so 5 x 10 = 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 pages has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's.\n\nAdding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, each block of 10 pages has one 8 in the units place. So, from 1-10, 8 appears once (page 8). From 11-20, once (page 18), etc. So, how many complete blocks of 10 in 488 pages? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete blocks and 8 extra pages. Each block contributes one 8, so 48. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so page 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. 8 appears in the tens digit in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488. Each full block (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. How many full blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four blocks, each contributing 10 8's, so 4 x 10 = 40. Now, the last block is 480-488. How many pages are there here? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 pages. So, in the tens place, 480-488 has 9 pages where the tens digit is 8. So, that's 9 more 8's. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0.\n\nAdding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full tens (each contributing 1) + 1 in the last 8 pages = 49\n- Tens: 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449) each contributing 10, so 5*10=50\n- Hundreds: 89 pages (400-488) each contributing 1, so 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full tens + 1 in the last 8 pages = 49\n- Tens: 4 full blocks (80-89, etc.) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus 9 in 480-488, so 40+9=49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. That also seems correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. The blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's five blocks, right? Wait, no, because 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, but the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, the first four blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10 8's, and then 480-488 contributing 9. So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49, which matches. So, yes, 49 in the tens place for 8's.\n\nWait, but in the 4's tens place, I had five blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these contributes 10 4's, so 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\nAnd for the hundreds place, 4's are from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's there.\n\nSo, the total 4's are 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: The 4's appear every 10 pages. So from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 pages, like 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such numbers are there? Let's see, the last one is 484, which is 480 + 4, so that's 48 times 10 plus 4. Wait, no, actually, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? It's 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So that's 48 times. But wait, does 488 include another 4 in the units place? No, because 488 ends with an 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place: The 4's appear in the tens place every 100 pages, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So that's five ranges. Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, except the last one, which is 400-488. Wait, does 440-449 fall within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, the first four ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349) each have 10 4's, and the last range, 440-449, also has 10. So that's 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 times. Wait, but does the last range go up to 449, which is within 488, so yes, 10 times. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 times.\n\nAdding them up: Units place 48, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. So total 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units place: 48, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with the units place: 8 appears every 10 pages, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So that's 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so the last occurrence is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, because from 1 to 488, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) + 1 if the last number is included. Wait, no, let me think again. The number of times 8 appears in the units place is how many numbers ending with 8 are there up to 488. So, starting from 8, 18, ..., 488. The number of such numbers is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place: 8's appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last one, which has 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, let's see: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So total is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding them up: Units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. So total 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, when I counted the 4's in the tens place, I thought it was 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 50. But let me check: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's five ranges, each with 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nFor the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nFor the 8's in the units place: 49 times, as we have 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Correct.\n\nFor the 8's in the tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nSo total 4's: 48 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=187.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:187-98=89.\n\nWait, but I feel like that might be correct, but let me think again. Maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, when counting the 8's in the tens place, does 480-488 include 488? Yes, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So that's 9, not 10. So, yes, 49 total in the tens place.\n\nAnd for the 4's in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's there.\n\nSo, yes, 187-98=89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

Once I have those counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4. I'll consider each digit place separately.\n\nFirst, the units place. In every set of ten numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in each of those 48 sets, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again in the units place here. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire block of ten numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: the first block is 40-49, the second is 140-149, the third is 240-249, the fourth is 340-349, and the fifth would be 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 5 times 10, which is 50. Now, after 440-449, the next block would be 540-549, but since the book only goes up to 488, that block isn't complete. So, we don't count any more 4's in the tens place beyond 440-449. So, total 4's in the tens place are 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. So, total 4's in the hundreds place are 89.\n\nAdding all those up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, there are 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in each set of ten numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of ten and 8 extra numbers. So, 48 times 1 is 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in the units place here. So, total 8's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Each full block (like 80-89) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's count the blocks:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n- 180-189: another 10.\n- 280-289: another 10.\n- 380-389: another 10.\n- 480-488: here, it's only 9 numbers (480-488), so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, which is 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 4\u00d710=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences here.\n\nAdding those up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 89.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears, then subtract the two to find the difference. That makes sense. So, I'll start by counting the number of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nLet me think about how to count the number of times a specific digit appears in each position. Each digit can appear in the units place, the tens place, or the hundreds place. So, I'll need to check each position separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the number of 4's:\n\n1. **Units place**: The digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). In each full block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. In the partial block, I need to check if there's a 4 in the units place. The numbers are 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 484 has a 4 in the units place, which is one more. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place**: Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). How many full hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred from 401-488. Each full hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, the partial hundred from 401-488: the tens digit is 0 in 401-410, 1 in 411-420, ..., 8 in 481-490. Wait, but 488 is the end, so the tens digit goes up to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's another 10 numbers, so 10 more 4's. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these 89 numbers, contributing 89 4's.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, correct. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Units place: 49, which seems right because 48 full tens and one more in the last partial block. Tens place: 50, which is 4 full hundreds contributing 10 each, and the partial hundred from 401-488 contributing another 10, so that adds up.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place**: Similar to 4's. Each block of 10 has one 8 in the units place. So, 48 full blocks give 48 8's, and the last partial block (481-488) has 488, which is an 8 in the units place. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place**: Each block of 100 has a block where the tens digit is 8, which is 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for each full hundred, that's 10 8's in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, the partial hundred from 401-488: the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 more 8's in the tens place. Therefore, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so total 4's are 188 and total 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems like a lot. Let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, when counting the hundreds place for 4's, I considered 400-488 as 89 numbers, which is correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's there.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. That's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 8's in the tens place. So, 40 from the full hundreds and 9 from the partial, totaling 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but when I counted the units place for 8's, I had 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 8, and then in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit is 8 in 488, so that's one more. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nWait, so 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. That's the difference. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I feel like maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me check the tens place for 4's again. I said that in each full hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so 4 full hundreds give 40. Then, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, 40 + 10 = 50. That seems right.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, in the partial hundred, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, so the total 4's are 188 and 8's are 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the best way to approach this is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have those counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately.\n\nFirst, the units place. In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 10, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So in each block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. Now, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and an extra 8 numbers. In each of these 48 blocks, the 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. So for the digit 4 in the tens place, it appears 10 times in each block of 100. Now, how many complete blocks of 100 are in 488? That's 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each of the 4 blocks, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40 times. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 (for 401-410) to 8 (for 481-490, but we only go up to 488). So the tens digit is 4 in the range 441-450, which is 10 times. Wait, but 488 is less than 490, so actually, from 401 to 488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 numbers. So that's another 10 times. So total 4's in the tens place are 40 +10=50.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Let me check again. From 401-488, the tens digit is 0 in 401-410, 1 in 411-420, up to 8 in 481-490, but since we stop at 488, the tens digit 8 only goes up to 488, which is 8 numbers (481-488). So the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 numbers. So that's 10 more, making it 40+10=50. So 50 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit changes every 1000 numbers, but since our book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3, or 4. Wait, actually, for page numbers 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, but since we're considering page numbers starting from 1, maybe it's better to think of them as three-digit numbers with leading zeros, like 001, 002, etc., but I don't think the hundreds digit is printed for pages less than 100. Wait, but in reality, page numbers 1-9 are single-digit, 10-99 are two-digit, and 100-488 are three-digit. So for the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for page numbers 400-488. How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these 89 numbers, so that's 89 times. \n\nSo total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Because from 1 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, each block of 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Now, the remaining 8 numbers are 481-488, where the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in the units place (at 488). So total 8's in the units place are 48 +1=49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place per block of 100. So for 8 in the tens place, each block contributes 10 times. Now, how many complete blocks of 100 are there? 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40. Now, the remaining 88 pages (401-488) have the tens digit ranging from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but we stop at 488). So in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So that's 8 more times. So total 8's in the tens place are 40 +8=48.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So 0 times.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (48) + hundreds (0) = 49+48=97.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. From 1-480, each block of 10 has one 8, so 48 blocks, 48 times. Then 481-488: 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. The units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once at 488. So total 48+1=49, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, from 1-400, each block of 100 contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 blocks give 40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 more. So 40+8=48.\n\nSo total 8's: 49+48=97.\n\nNow, number of 4's was 187, and number of 8's is 97. So the difference is 187-97=90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, when I calculated the number of 4's in the hundreds place, I said from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. But wait, 400-488 inclusive is 89 numbers (since 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89). So 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place, I had 50 times. Let me check that again. From 1-400, each block of 100 contributes 10 times in the tens place, so 4 blocks give 40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 numbers. So 40+10=50, correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 times. From 1-480, 48 blocks of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then 481-488: units digits 1-8, no 4, so total 48.\n\nSo 48+50+89=187.\n\nFor 8's: units place 49, tens place 48, hundreds 0, total 97.\n\n187-97=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place for 4's. Let me think again. Pages 400-488: that's 89 pages, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the hundreds place for 8's. Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 0, which is correct.\n\nSo the difference is 187-97=90.\n\nWait, but let me check the 8's in the tens place again. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times. So 40+8=48, correct.\n\nHmm, seems correct. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** Each block of 10 numbers contains one 4. There are 48 complete blocks (488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8), contributing 48 \u00d7 1 = 48 fours. The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) don't add any more fours in the units place.\n2. **Tens place:** Each block of 100 numbers contains 10 fours in the tens place. With 4 complete blocks (1-400), that's 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 fours. From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 441-450, adding 10 more fours, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nTotal 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** Each block of 10 numbers contains one 8. With 48 complete blocks, that's 48 \u00d7 1 = 48 eights. The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) add one more 8 at 488, totaling 49.\n2. **Tens place:** Each block of 100 numbers contains 10 eights in the tens place. With 4 complete blocks, that's 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 481-488, adding 8 more eights, totaling 48.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers reach 800, so no eights here.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the digit 4. Let's think about each digit place separately.\n\nFirst, the units place. The digits cycle every 10 numbers, so in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then an extra 8 numbers. In each complete block, there's one 4 in the units place. So that's 48 times. Now, in the extra 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (484). So total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\n488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an extra 88 numbers (401-488). In each complete block, there are 10 4's in the tens place. So that's 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nNow, in the extra 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. The 4 in the tens place occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's another 10 4's. So total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). So the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, let me check that. From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Yep, so 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Again, every block of 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 8 appears once more (488). So total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. In each block of 100, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). So that's 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nIn the extra 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. The 8 in the tens place occurs in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So that's 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, total 4's are 188, and total 8's are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full decades, each contributing 1, plus 1 in the last partial decade (484), so 49.\n- Tens: 4 full centuries, each contributing 10, plus 10 in the last partial century (440-449), so 50.\n- Hundreds: 89 numbers from 400-488, so 89.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full decades, each contributing 1, plus 1 in the last partial decade (488), so 49.\n- Tens: 4 full centuries, each contributing 10, plus 9 in the last partial century (480-488), so 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nI think that's the answer. There are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are. \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: In every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, from 1 to 10, it's page 4; from 11 to 20, it's page 14, and so on. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then a partial block of 8 pages (481 to 488). In each complete block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. In the partial block, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (page 484). So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Here, the digit 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers, specifically from 40 to 49 in each hundred. So, in each hundred, that's 10 times. Since we have 488 pages, there are four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). In each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, 1 for 410-419, and so on up to 8 for 480-488. Wait, but the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449. That's another 10 times. So total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me check: from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each starting with 4 in the hundreds place. So yes, 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll count the number of 8's in units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place: Similar to the 4's, in every block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 pages. In each complete block, one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. In the partial block (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so page 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more, making it 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place from 80-89 in each hundred. So, in each hundred, that's 10 times. We have four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 times. So, that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 only in 480-489. But since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. In 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481,...,488). So, 9 times. So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, hundreds place has 0 eights.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. So, 49 + 49 is 98. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. In the tens place, for the last partial hundred (401-488), I considered 480-488, which is 9 numbers. But does 480-488 have 9 tens digits of 8? Let me list them: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, yes, 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49 in tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, for 4's, I had 188. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's again. Units place: 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing 1, so 48, plus 1 in the last partial block (484), so 49. Tens place: Each hundred contributes 10, so 4 hundreds give 40, plus in 440-449, which is another 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's: Units place: 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48, plus 1 in the last partial block (488), so 49. Tens place: Each hundred contributes 10, so 4 hundreds give 40, plus in 480-488, which is 9, so 49. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I feel like the difference might be smaller. Let me check if I counted correctly.\n\nWait, another way to count: For each digit place, units, tens, hundreds, count the number of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFor 4's: Each 10 pages, 4 appears once. From 1 to 488, that's 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20,..., 481-490, but wait, 488 is less than 490, so up to 488. So, 48 full decades, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in the last partial decade (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 484 has a 4, so one more. So, 49.\n\nFor 8's: Similarly, each 10 pages, 8 appears once. 48 full decades, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in the last partial decade (481-488), 488 has an 8, so one more. So, 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4's: In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49). So, 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) each contribute 10, so 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10. So, total 50.\n\nFor 8's: In each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (80-89). So, 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, total 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor 4's: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nFor 8's: There's no page number where the hundreds digit is 8 because the book ends at 488. So, 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me check once more to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as counting in each digit place:\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) = 48, plus if the last digit is >=4, which it is, so 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's: floor(488/10)=48, plus if last digit >=8, which it is (488 ends with 8), so 48 +1=49.\n\nFor tens digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100)*10 + min(max(488%100 -40 +1,0),10). So, floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40. Then, 488%100=88, so 88-40+1=49, but we only go up to 88, so min(49,10)=10. So, 40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's: floor(488/100)*10=40. Then, 488%100=88, so 88-80+1=9. So, 40+9=49.\n\nFor hundreds digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: if 400 <=488, then 488-400+1=89.\n\nNumber of 8's: 0, since 800>488.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49+50+89=188\n\n8's:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I think I did it right. There are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Maybe I can calculate how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and then do the same for 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For the units digit, every 10 consecutive numbers will have one 4 and one 8. For example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. This pattern repeats every 10 numbers. \n\nSo, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups and then 8 extra numbers. In each complete group, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, for the units place, 4 appears 48 times and 8 appears 48 times. But wait, there are 8 extra numbers: 481 to 488. Let me check the units digits here: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in these, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So, total for units place: 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. Hmm, so the units place contributes equally to both digits.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digits go from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, in each block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (80-89). \n\nSo, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 numbers (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 10 times. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times for 4 and 4 * 10 = 40 times for 8. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 480-488). Let me check how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nLooking at 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for the tens digit 4, it's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440 is within 401-488, so 440-449 is 10 numbers. Similarly, for 8, it's 480-488, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. From 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (480-488). So, for the tens digit 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred. \n\nSo, adding up the tens place: 4 appears 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from partial) = 50 times, and 8 appears 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 (from partial) = 49 times.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Each complete hundred has 10 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place, so 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then, in the last 88 pages, which are 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1. From 200-299, it's 2, and so on up to 400-488, where it's 4.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit 4 appears in all page numbers from 400 to 488. Let's see how many numbers that is. 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. \n\nWhat about the hundreds digit 8? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, the hundreds digit contributes 89 times for 4 and 0 times for 8.\n\nSo, let me sum up the counts:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 488 pages, so 48 full tens and 8 extra. Each full ten contributes 1 four and 1 eight. So, 48 each, plus in the last 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. So, units: 48 +1=49, same for 8's.\n\nTens place: Each full hundred (1-100, etc.) has 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds, so 4*10=40 each. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449 (10 times), and 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is included. So, tens place: 40+10=50 for 4's, and 40+9=49 for 8's.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 fours. No eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up: 4's: 49+50+89=188, 8's:49+49+0=98. Difference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check the last partial hundred again. From 401 to 488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But 440 is within 401-488, so that's correct. And 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place there.\n\nAnother way to think about it: For the tens digit in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear? Each tens digit appears 10 times except for the last one, which appears 9 times because the book ends at 488. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but actually, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but each tens digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times. So, yes, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, the counts seem correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. \n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks (480 numbers) and 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n   - In the units place: 49 times for 4 and 49 times for 8.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 fours and 10 eights.\n   - There are 4 complete blocks (400 numbers) and a partial block (401-488).\n   - In the partial block, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total in tens place: 50 fours and 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, it's page 4; from 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. So, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times in each set, plus once in the incomplete set (page 484). Wait, no, actually, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once in the units place there as well. So, total units place 4's would be 48 (from the complete sets) plus 1 (from the incomplete set) = 49 times.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire block of ten numbers. For example, from 40-49, each page number has a 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, the first block is 40-49, the next would be 140-149, then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, looking at units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, in every set of ten, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488? 48 complete sets, as before, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, 8 appears 48 times in the complete sets plus once in the incomplete set (page 488). So, 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Each complete block contributes 10 occurrences, but the last block contributes 9. So, how many complete blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four blocks, each contributing 10 times, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, the incomplete block 480-488 contributes 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. The hundreds digits are 1, 2, 3, and 4. So, 8 doesn't appear here at all. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. For the tens place, I had four complete blocks (80-89, etc.) each contributing 10, so 4\u00d710=40, and then 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9. So, 40+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's are 188, and total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, for the units place of 4's: 488 pages. Each ten has one 4 in the units place. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete tens, each contributing 1, so 48\u00d71=48. Then, in the incomplete ten (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total units 4's: 48 +1=49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place for 4's: The blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10, so 5\u00d710=50. That seems right.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, so 89 4's. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: Each ten has one 8, so 48 complete tens, 48\u00d71=48. Then, in 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which is an 8. So, units place 8's: 48+1=49.\n\nTens place: Blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me count the number of blocks. From 80-89: that's one block, contributing 10. Then 180-189: another block, 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Then 480-488: that's 9 numbers. So, that's five blocks in total: four complete blocks contributing 10 each, and one incomplete block contributing 9. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: As before, 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nSo, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place, 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Units place 49. So, 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's, units place 49, tens place 49, so 98.\n\n188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I was counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as a block, but does that include all the 8's in the tens place? Let me list them:\n\n80-89: 10 numbers, 8 in tens place.\n\n180-189: another 10.\n\n280-289: another 10.\n\n380-389: another 10.\n\n480-488: 9 numbers (480-488), so 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nSo, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, correct.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times 8 in the tens place. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct, and the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - In every set of ten numbers, 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - Number of complete sets of ten in 488 pages: 48.\n   - Each contributes 1 occurrence: 48 \u00d7 1 = 48.\n   - In the incomplete set (481-488), 4 appears once (484).\n   - Total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place for blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Number of such blocks: 5.\n   - Total tens place 4's: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of such numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, 8 appears once in every set of ten.\n   - Complete sets: 48, contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - In the incomplete set (481-488), 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Complete blocks: 4, each contributing 10 occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Incomplete block (480-488) contributes 9 occurrences.\n   - Total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place (pages go up to 488).\n   - Total hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) separately and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have the total counts for 4's and 8's, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, in every set of 10 consecutive pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, same with 8. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of 10, and then 8 extra pages. In each complete set, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place, so that's 48 times each. Now, for the extra 8 pages, which are 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these extra pages, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, in the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's, which is also 49. So, the difference in the units place is zero.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. In each set of 100 pages, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for example, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times in 40-49, 140-149, etc. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in 80-89, 180-189, etc. Now, since the book has 488 pages, let's see how many complete hundreds we have. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so 4 times 10 is 40. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in each hundred, so 4 times 10 is 40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. \n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-488). So, for the tens digit 4, it appears in 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So, that's 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 times (480-488). So, in the tens place for the remaining 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, adding that to the complete hundreds: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's. Therefore, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times, so the difference here is 1.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so it doesn't contribute. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, so neither 4 nor 8. From 200-299, it's 2, same thing. From 300-399, it's 3. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (400-488 inclusive), so 89 times. As for 8, does the hundreds digit ever reach 8? No, because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is only 4 in this case. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times and 8 appears 0 times, so the difference here is 89.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each place:\n\n- Units place: 49 vs. 49 \u2192 difference 0\n- Tens place: 50 vs. 49 \u2192 difference +1\n- Hundreds place: 89 vs. 0 \u2192 difference +89\n\nAdding these up: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nStarting with the units place: 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing 1 to both 4 and 8, so 48 each. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have 484 and 488, so that's one more 4 and one more 8. So, units total is 49 each, correct.\n\nTens place: Each complete hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place. So, 4 times 10 is 40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. The tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, total tens for 4: 40 +10=50, and for 8: 40+9=49. So, the difference is indeed +1.\n\nHundreds place: Only from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so hundreds digit is 4 appearing 89 times, and 8 never appears here. So, difference is +89.\n\nTotal difference: 0 (units) +1 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 90.\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each set of 10 pages contains one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 480 pages, contributing 48 each.\n   - Pages 481-488 add one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Difference: 49 - 49 = 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each set of 100 pages has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place.\n   - Four complete hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 each.\n   - Pages 401-488: 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - Difference: 50 - 49 = +1.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Difference: 89 - 0 = +89.\n\nSumming the differences: 0 (units) + 1 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the first thing I should do is figure out how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by considering the different positions where the digits can appear: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll need to calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each of these positions separately and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each set of ten consecutive numbers. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So each digit from 0 to 9 appears once every ten numbers. \n\nBut wait, the book starts at page 1, so the first set is 1-10, then 11-20, and so on. So maybe I should adjust for that. Let me think: from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). \n\nSo for the units place, in each complete set of ten, the digit 4 appears once (like 4,14,24,...) and the same for 8. So in 48 complete sets, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48, and the same for 8. But wait, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So in that last set, does 4 appear? Yes, at 484, and 8 appears at 488. So that adds one more 4 and one more 8 in the units place.\n\nSo total units place 4's: 48 (from complete sets) + 1 (from partial set) = 49.\n\nSimilarly, units place 8's: 48 +1 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait a second. When I'm calculating the units place, I think I might be making a mistake here. Let me check again. The total number of complete sets is 48, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Then, the partial set from 481 to 488 has 8 numbers, so the units digits go from 1 to 8. So in this partial set, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So yes, that adds one each. So units place 4's: 48 +1=49, same for 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So in each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSince the book has 488 pages, that's 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an extra 88 pages (401-488). \n\nSo for the tens place, in each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.) and the same for 8 (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So for each hundred, 10 times each. So for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10=40 times for 4 and 40 times for 8.\n\nNow, the extra 88 pages: 401-488. Let's look at the tens digit here. From 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, tens digit is 1; 421-430, tens digit is 2; 431-440, tens digit is 3; 441-450, tens digit is 4; 451-460, tens digit is 5; 461-470, tens digit is 6; 471-480, tens digit is 7; and 481-488, tens digit is 8.\n\nWait, so in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 441-450, which is 10 times. Similarly, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? From 481-490, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so it's from 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers, so 8 times.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. The tens digit is 8 for all numbers from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? Wait, 480 is page 480, then 481 to 488 is 8 pages, so total 9 pages where the tens digit is 8. So in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times. Hmm, but wait, 480 is included, so from 480-488 is 9 pages. So in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check: 480 is page 480, and 481-488 is 8 pages, so total 9 pages where the tens digit is 8. So the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in 401-488. Similarly, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times.\n\nWait, but 441-450 is 10 pages, right? So in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo for the tens place, total 4's: 4*10 (from complete hundreds) +10 (from partial set) = 50.\n\nTotal 8's: 4*10 (from complete hundreds) +9 (from partial set) = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, in the complete hundreds, each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So 4 hundreds would be 4*10=40 for 4's and 40 for 8's. Then in the partial set, 401-488, we have 10 times 4's and 9 times 8's. So total 4's in tens place: 40+10=50, and 8's:40+9=49.\n\nWait, but wait, 401-488 is the 5th hundred, right? So 401-500 would be the fifth hundred, but since the book stops at 488, it's only up to 488. So in the partial hundred, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. And 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 times because 480 is included and 481-488 is 8 pages, so total 9.\n\nSo that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. How about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but the book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So number of 8's in hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my calculations again because 188 - 98 is 90, which seems like a big difference, but maybe it's correct.\n\nWait, let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nEach complete set of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. There are 48 complete sets (since 488 / 10 = 48.8), so 48 times each. Then, the last partial set is 481-488, which has 8 pages. The units digits here are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So units place 4's: 48 +1=49, same for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach complete hundred contributes 10 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place. So 4 hundreds would be 4*10=40 for each. Now, the partial hundred is 401-488. In this range, the tens digit 4 appears from 441-450, which is 10 times. The tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 times because 480 is included and 481-488 is 8 pages, so total 9. So total 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50, 8's:40 +9=49. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages (488 - 400 +1=89). 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\nSo the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me just make sure I didn't double-count or miss anything.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: maybe I should calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position separately, then sum them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a formula for each digit position.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is given by:\n\nfloor(n/10)*1 + min(max(n%10 - d +1, 0), 10).\n\nWait, maybe that's a bit complicated, but perhaps I can apply it here.\n\nWait, for 4's in units place:\n\nn=488.\n\nNumber of complete sets of 10: floor(488/10)=48.\n\nEach contributes 1 occurrence, so 48.\n\nThen, the remainder is 488%10=8.\n\nSo the extra occurrences are max(0, 8 -4 +1)=5? Wait, no, that formula might not be correct.\n\nWait, actually, the number of times digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is:\n\nnumber_of_complete = floor(n / 10)\n\nremainder = n % 10\n\nif d <= remainder:\n    extra = 1\nelse:\n    extra = 0\n\ntotal = number_of_complete *1 + extra.\n\nWait, so for d=4, n=488:\n\nnumber_of_complete =48, remainder=8.\n\nSince 4 <=8, extra=1. So total 4's in units place:48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly for d=8:\n\nnumber_of_complete=48, remainder=8.\n\nSince 8<=8, extra=1. So total 8's in units place:48+1=49.\n\nSame as before.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to n is:\n\nnumber_of_complete = floor(n / 100)\n\neach complete hundred contributes 10 times.\n\nremainder = n % 100\n\nif remainder >= 10*d:\n    extra = 10\nelse:\n    if remainder >= d*10:\n        extra = remainder - d*10 +1\n    else:\n        extra=0\n\nWait, perhaps another way: for each hundred, the digit d appears 10 times in the tens place. Then, for the partial hundred, if the tens digit is d, then it appears from 10*d to min(10*(d+1)-1, n).\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to think of it as:\n\nnumber_of_complete = floor(n / 100)\n\ntotal = number_of_complete *10\n\nremainder = n % 100\n\nif remainder >=10*d:\n    total +=10\nelif remainder >=d*10:\n    total += remainder - d*10 +1\nelse:\n    total +=0\n\nWait, let me test this for d=4, n=488.\n\nnumber_of_complete=4 (since 488/100=4.88, floor is 4).\n\ntotal=4*10=40.\n\nremainder=88.\n\nCheck if 88 >=10*4=40: yes, so total +=10, making total 50.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8, n=488.\n\nnumber_of_complete=4.\n\ntotal=4*10=40.\n\nremainder=88.\n\nCheck if 88 >=10*8=80: yes, so total +=10, making total 50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in the partial hundred, 4's in tens place appeared 10 times (441-450) and 8's appeared 9 times (480-488). But according to this formula, both would have 10 extra in the partial hundred, making total 50 for both.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier calculation where 8's in the tens place only appeared 9 times. So where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, let me check the partial hundred for 401-488.\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So for d=4, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, but wait, 440 is page 440, which is within 401-488, right? So 440-449 is 10 pages, so 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8, the tens digit is 8 from 480-489, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 pages. So in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the partial hundred.\n\nBut according to the formula, since remainder=88, which is greater than or equal to 80 (10*8), it adds 10, making total 50. But in reality, it's only 9 times.\n\nHmm, so the formula might not be accurate here because the remainder is 88, but the actual upper limit is 488, which is less than 490. So perhaps the formula overcounts when the remainder is beyond the actual range.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula should be adjusted to consider the actual maximum number. Let me think again.\n\nThe formula for the number of times d appears in the tens place from 1 to n is:\n\nnumber_of_complete = floor(n / 100)\n\ntotal = number_of_complete *10\n\nremainder = n % 100\n\nif remainder >= 10*d:\n    total +=10\nelse:\n    if remainder >= d*10:\n        total += remainder - d*10 +1\n    else:\n        total +=0\n\nWait, let me apply this to d=8, n=488.\n\nnumber_of_complete=4.\n\ntotal=4*10=40.\n\nremainder=88.\n\nSince 88 >=80 (10*8), so total +=10, making total=50.\n\nBut in reality, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 times, not 10. So the formula is overcounting by 1.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is correct when n is a multiple of 100, but when it's not, it might overcount in some cases. Let me check for d=8, n=488.\n\nThe tens digit is 8 in the range 480-489, but since n=488, it's only up to 488, so from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So the formula is adding 10, which is incorrect.\n\nSo perhaps the formula should be adjusted. Maybe the correct way is:\n\nFor the tens place, the number of times d appears is:\n\nnumber_of_complete = floor(n / 100)\n\ntotal = number_of_complete *10\n\nremainder = n % 100\n\nstart = d*10\n\nend = (d+1)*10 -1\n\nif start > remainder:\n    extra =0\nelse:\n    if end <= remainder:\n        extra=10\n    else:\n        extra= remainder - start +1\n\ntotal += extra\n\nSo applying this to d=8, n=488.\n\nnumber_of_complete=4.\n\ntotal=4*10=40.\n\nremainder=88.\n\nstart=80, end=89.\n\nSince start=80 <=88, and end=89 >88, so extra=88 -80 +1=9.\n\nSo total=40 +9=49.\n\nSimilarly, for d=4, n=488.\n\nstart=40, end=49.\n\nSince 40 <=88 and 49 <=88, so extra=10.\n\nTotal=40 +10=50.\n\nAh, that makes more sense. So earlier, I was correct in my manual calculation: for 4's in the tens place, it's 50, and for 8's, it's 49.\n\nSo I think I made a mistake earlier when applying the formula, but upon recalculating, the manual count was correct.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\nUnits place:\n- 4's:49\n- 8's:49\n\nTens place:\n- 4's:50\n- 8's:49\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's:89\n- 8's:0\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is 188, while the digit 8 appears 98 times. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll go through each place one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nFirst, for the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, I can divide 488 by 10 to find out how many complete blocks there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and an extra 8 numbers. Each block contributes one 4, so that's 48 fours. Now, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, 484 is in this range, which adds one more 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each block of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 occurrences of a specific digit in the tens place. For the digit 4, it's from 40-49 in each block. So, how many such blocks are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks and an extra 88 numbers. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 blocks give 40 fours. Now, in the extra 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for the numbers 440-449. That's 10 more fours. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.\n\nNow, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total.\n\nNext, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to the fours, every block of 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks and an extra 8 numbers. Each block contributes one 8, so 48 eights. In the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included, which adds one more 8. So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 such numbers. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete blocks and an extra 88 numbers. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 blocks give 40 eights. Now, in the extra 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for the numbers 480-489. But wait, 480-489 is within 401-488 only up to 488. So, that's 9 numbers: 480-488. So, 9 eights in the tens place. Wait, no, actually, 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, that adds 9 more eights. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no hundreds place eights. So, 0 eights here.\n\nAdding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units: 48 full blocks (480) + 1 extra (484) = 49\n- Tens: 4 blocks (400) + 10 in 440-449 = 50\n- Hundreds: 89 (400-488)\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units: 48 full blocks (480) + 1 extra (488) = 49\n- Tens: 4 blocks (400) + 9 in 480-488 = 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 = 98. That also seems correct.\n\nSubtracting 98 from 188 gives 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 4.  \n   - Total units place 4's = (488 // 10) + (1 if 488 % 10 >= 4 else 0) = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - Every 100 numbers have 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.  \n   - Total tens place 4's = (488 // 100) * 10 + min((488 % 100) + 1, 10) = 4*10 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - From 400 to 488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place.  \n   - Total hundreds place 4's = 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 8.  \n   - Total units place 8's = (488 // 10) + (1 if 488 % 10 >= 8 else 0) = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - Every 100 numbers have 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.  \n   - Additionally, in the range 480-488, there are 9 such numbers.  \n   - Total tens place 8's = (488 // 100) * 10 + min((488 % 100) + 1, 10) = 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).  \n   - Total hundreds place 8's = 0.\n\n**Total 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.**\n\n**Difference: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.**\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me think about how to count the digits. Maybe I can separate the counting based on the number of digits in the page numbers. So, pages 1-9 are single-digit, 10-99 are two-digit, 100-488 are three-digit. That makes sense.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers (1-9), I can see that only page 4 has a 4, and page 8 has an 8. So, in single digits, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So, the count so far is 4:1, 8:1.\n\nNext, let's move on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Each two-digit number has a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nFirst, for the tens place in two-digit numbers. The tens digit can be from 1 to 9, and the units digit can be from 0 to 9. So, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, when the tens digit is 4, the units digit can be anything from 0 to 9, so that's 10 numbers: 40-49. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens digit being 8, the numbers would be 80-89, which is another 10 numbers. So, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers. The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each tens digit. So, for each set of ten numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. Since there are 9 sets (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), that would be 9 times. Wait, no, actually, from 10-99, there are 90 numbers, which is 9 sets of 10. But each set has one 4 in the units place, so 9 times. But wait, 40-49 is already counted in the tens place, but in the units place, 40 has a 4 in the tens place and 0 in the units, but 41 has 4 in tens and 1 in units, etc., so each of the 10 numbers in the 40-49 range has a 4 in the tens place, but only 44 has a 4 in both tens and units. Wait, no, actually, when counting the units place, it's regardless of the tens digit. So, for each tens digit from 1 to 9, the units digit 4 appears once. So, 9 times. So, 4 appears 9 times in the units place for two-digit numbers.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the units place, it's the same logic. Each tens digit from 1 to 9 will have an 8 in the units place once, so 9 times. So, 8 appears 9 times in the units place.\n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, 4 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times, and 8 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times.\n\nWait, but let me check that. For the tens place, 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 10 times for 4 in tens. For units place, each ten's group (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.) has one 4 in the units, so 9 groups, 9 times. So, 10 + 9 = 19 for 4. Similarly, 80-89 is 10 for tens, and 9 for units, so 19 for 8 as well.\n\nSo, up to two-digit numbers, 4's count is 1 (single-digit) + 19 (two-digit) = 20, and 8's count is 1 + 19 = 20. So, they're equal so far. But the book goes up to 488, which is a three-digit number, so I need to check the three-digit page numbers as well.\n\nThree-digit page numbers are from 100 to 488. Let me break this down into hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book ends at 488. So, the hundreds digit ranges from 1 to 4.\n\nI need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place. How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit can't be 8 because the book only goes up to 488. The hundreds digit is only 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's count in hundreds place is 0.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be from 0 to 9, and the units digit can be from 0 to 9. But since the book ends at 488, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can only go up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, I need to be careful with the hundreds digit 4 and tens digit 8.\n\nLet me approach this by considering hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 separately.\n\nFirst, hundreds digit 1: 100-199. The tens digit can be 0-9, and the units digit 0-9. So, for each hundreds digit, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nFor 4 in the tens place: when the tens digit is 4, the units digit can be 0-9, so 10 numbers for each hundreds digit. Since hundreds digit 1, 2, 3, and 4 all have 4 in the tens place, but wait, no, I'm considering hundreds digit 1 first. So, for hundreds digit 1, when tens digit is 4, the numbers are 140-149, which is 10 numbers. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place for hundreds digit 1.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place: when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 180-189, which is another 10 numbers. So, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place for hundreds digit 1.\n\nNow, moving on to hundreds digit 2: 200-299. The same logic applies. For tens digit 4: 240-249, 10 numbers. So, 4 appears 10 times. For tens digit 8: 280-289, 10 numbers. So, 8 appears 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds digit 3: 300-399. Tens digit 4: 340-349, 10 numbers. Tens digit 8: 380-389, 10 numbers. So, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place for hundreds digit 3.\n\nNow, hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Here, the tens digit can be 0-8 because the book ends at 488. So, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can be 0-8. So, for 4 in the tens place: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place: when the tens digit is 8, the numbers would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, adding up the counts for the tens place across all hundreds digits:\n\nFor 4 in tens place: hundreds digits 1, 2, 3 each contribute 10, and hundreds digit 4 contributes 10. So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 times.\n\nFor 8 in tens place: hundreds digits 1, 2, 3 each contribute 10, and hundreds digit 4 contributes 9. So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. For hundreds digit 4, when tens digit is 8, the numbers go from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, yes, 9 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. The units digit can be 0-9 for each combination of hundreds and tens digits. So, for each hundreds digit, and each tens digit, the units digit cycles through 0-9.\n\nLet me again break it down by hundreds digits.\n\nStarting with hundreds digit 1: 100-199.\n\nFor 4 in the units place: For each tens digit (0-9), there's one number where the units digit is 4. So, for tens digits 0-9, that's 10 numbers each. So, 10 times for 4 in units place for hundreds digit 1.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the units place: same logic, 10 times for hundreds digit 1.\n\nSame applies for hundreds digits 2, 3, and 4.\n\nWait, but for hundreds digit 4, the tens digit only goes up to 8, as the book ends at 488. So, for hundreds digit 4, the tens digit can be 0-8, so 9 possible tens digits. So, for each of these 9 tens digits, the units digit 4 and 8 will appear once each. So, for hundreds digit 4, units digit 4 appears 9 times, and units digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nLet me confirm:\n\nFor hundreds digit 1: units digit 4 appears 10 times (101, 111, ..., 191? Wait, no, actually, for each tens digit, the units digit cycles. So, for hundreds digit 1, tens digit 0: 104, 114, 124, ..., 194. Wait, no, that's not correct. For hundreds digit 1, tens digit 0: 100-109, so units digit 4 is at 104. Similarly, tens digit 1: 110-119, units digit 4 at 114, etc., up to tens digit 9: 190-199, units digit 4 at 194. So, that's 10 numbers where units digit is 4. Similarly for 8.\n\nSame applies for hundreds digits 2 and 3: 10 times each for units digits 4 and 8.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4: tens digits 0-8, so 9 tens digits. For each, units digit 4 appears once, so 9 times. Similarly, units digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total units digit counts:\n\nFor 4: hundreds digits 1, 2, 3 each contribute 10, and hundreds digit 4 contributes 9. So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nFor 8: same as 4, 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. For hundreds digit 4, units digit 4 appears 9 times because the tens digit only goes up to 8, so 9 tens digits. So, yes, 9 times.\n\nSo, putting it all together for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n- Tens place: 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n- Units place: 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't add up. Let me re-express this.\n\nWait, for three-digit numbers, I've broken down the hundreds, tens, and units places separately. So, for 4's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 times.\n- Tens place: 40 times.\n- Units place: 39 times.\nTotal for 4: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 times.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0 times.\n- Tens place: 39 times.\n- Units place: 39 times.\nTotal for 8: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78 times.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I was calculating the tens place for three-digit numbers, I got 40 times for 4 and 39 times for 8. Similarly, units place for 4 was 39 times, same as 8.\n\nSo, total for 4 in three-digit numbers: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n\nTotal for 8 in three-digit numbers: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\nNow, adding up all the counts from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nFor 4:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nFor 8:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check the three-digit counts again because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, for the tens place, I had:\n\n- 4 appears 40 times in tens place.\n- 8 appears 39 times in tens place.\n\nAnd for units place:\n\n- 4 appears 39 times.\n- 8 appears 39 times.\n\nSo, for 4 in three-digit: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n\nFor 8 in three-digit: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nAdding up all digits:\n\n4's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 1 + 19 = 20, 20 + 168 = 188.\n\n8's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 1 + 19 = 20, 20 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's printed is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big difference, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me go through each part again.\n\nSingle-digit:\n\n- 4: 1\n- 8: 1\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Tens place: 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n- Units place: 4 appears 9 times (14,24,...,94), 8 appears 9 times (18,28,...,98).\nTotal for two-digit: 19 each.\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8: 0.\n- Tens place: 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n- Units place: 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\nTotal for three-digit: 4's = 89 + 40 + 39 = 168, 8's = 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nAdding up all:\n\n4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Single-Digit Pages (1-9):**\n   - '4' appears once (page 4).\n   - '8' appears once (page 8).\n\n2. **Two-Digit Pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - '4' appears in 40-49: 10 times.\n     - '8' appears in 80-89: 10 times.\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - For each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, etc.), '4' and '8' each appear once in the units place.

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should start by analyzing how often the digits 4 and 8 appear in each place: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me think about each digit place separately.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears once (like 4, 14, 24, etc.) and the same goes for 8. So, in the units place, the number of 4's and 8's should be the same, right? But wait, I need to check if 488 affects this because it's the last page. Let me calculate how many complete sets of 10 there are up to 488. \n\n488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. In each complete set, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, that's 48 times each. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial set, the units digit 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total in units place: 48 +1 = 49 for 4's, and 48 +1 = 49 for 8's. So, they're equal here.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, in 0-99, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in 80-89, 10 times. Now, up to 488, how many hundreds are there? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 10 times. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 for each. Now, looking at the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, for the tens digit 4, it appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here. \n\nWait, let me make sure. From 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), up to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. The tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the end. So, in the partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times. \n\nSo, total in tens place: for 4's, 4*10 +10=50, and for 8's, 4*10 +9=49. So, 4's have 50 and 8's have 49 in the tens place. So, 4's are one more here.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case. Each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has the same hundreds digit. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. Let's see how many times that is. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. \n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 8's have zero in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 +50 +89= 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 +49 +0= 98\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1 for 4 and 8, so 48 each. Then the last 8 numbers (481-488) have 484 (one 4) and 488 (one 8). So, 49 each. Correct.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 for 4 and 10 for 8. So, 40 each. Then the last partial hundred, 401-488. For 4 in tens, 440-449 is 10. For 8 in tens, 480-488 is 9. So, 50 for 4 and 49 for 8. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 for 4. 8 doesn't appear in hundreds place, so 0 for 8. Correct.\n\nSo total 4's: 49+50+89=188. 8's: 49+49+0=98. Difference is 90. So, 4's are printed 90 more times than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Up to page 488, there are 48 full sets of 10 and 8 extra pages.\n   - Each digit 4 and 8 appears 48 times in the units place from the full sets.\n   - In the extra 8 pages (481-488), 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total in units place: 49 for both 4's and 8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), contributing 40 each for 4's and 8's.\n   - In the last partial hundred (401-488), 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total in tens place: 50 for 4's and 49 for 8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total in hundreds place: 89 for 4's and 0 for 8's.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, I'll need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears, then find the difference between those two counts.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each place one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place**: For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. To find out how many times 4 appears in the units place up to page 488, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives me 48 full groups of 10, and then there are 8 remaining numbers (481-488). Each of these 48 groups contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\n2. **Tens place**: Similarly, for the tens place, every group of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 4. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Let me see, 488 divided by 100 is 4 full groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, actually, the first group is 1-100, so maybe I should adjust that. Wait, no, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, up to 400, there are 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, from 401 to 488, the tens digit is 0-8, so no additional 4's in the tens place here. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: Now, for the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nWait, but let me check that: 400 to 488 inclusive. So, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. Yes, that's correct. So, hundreds place gives 89 4's.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 40 = 88, plus 89 is 177. So, total 4's are 177.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8:\n\n1. **Units place**: Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. Now, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once here (page 488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place**: For the tens digit, every 100 numbers, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, up to 488, how many such groups? Let's see: 400-488 is the last partial hundred. So, the full hundreds are 1-100, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, in each of the first three hundreds (1-100, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers each. That's 3*10=30. Now, in 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 only when the tens place is 8, so that's 10 numbers if it were 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. Wait, but actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? Because 480 is 4 8 0, 481 is 4 8 1, up to 488. So, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, adding that to the previous 30, we get 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. From 1-100: 80-89 is 10 numbers. 200-299: 280-289, another 10. 300-399: 380-389, another 10. 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: Now, the hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 occurrences of 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's are units (49) + tens (39) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 39 = 88.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier I had 4's at 177 and 8's at 88, so the difference would be 89. But let me double-check my counts because 88 seems a bit low for 8's.\n\nWait, let me recount the 8's in the tens place. From 1-100: 80-89 is 10 numbers, correct. 200-299: 280-289, another 10, correct. 300-399: 380-389, another 10, correct. Then 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers, as before. So, 10+10+10+9=39. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have 488 as the last page, which is 488, so units digit 8 appears once here. So, 48 +1=49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 39 (tens) = 88.\n\nNow, total 4's: 177.\n\nSo, the difference is 177 - 88 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check again because I might have made a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's there.\n\nUnits place: 48 times.\n\nTens place: 40 times.\n\nSo, 89 + 48 = 137, plus 40 is 177. That's correct.\n\nFor 8's, units: 49, tens: 39, total 88.\n\nSo, 177 - 88 = 89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought about it, I thought maybe 4's would be more, but 89 seems like a big difference. Let me check again.\n\nWait, another way: perhaps I should consider each digit place separately for both digits.\n\nLet me try a different approach, maybe using a formula for counting digits.\n\nFor a given digit d in a certain position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times d appears can be calculated based on higher digits and lower digits.\n\nBut maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I can list out the counts again to make sure.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: For every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, and then in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so no additional 4's. So, 48.\n\n- Tens place: Every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full hundreds. Each contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's: 40 +10=50.\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 40, but now I'm getting 50. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Let me check again.\n\nWait, when considering the tens place, for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, up to 400, we have 4 such hundreds: 1-100, 200-299, 300-399, 400-499. But our book only goes up to 488, so in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 4*10=40 (from 1-400) plus 10 from 440-449, totaling 50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 40. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's think: up to page 400, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nFrom 1-100: 40-49, that's 10.\n\nFrom 200-299: 240-249, another 10.\n\nFrom 300-399: 340-349, another 10.\n\nFrom 400-488: 440-449, another 10.\n\nSo, that's 4 sets of 10, totaling 40. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, up to 488, the tens place 4's are 40. So, my initial count was correct at 40. So, where did I go wrong in the second approach?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the hundreds. Let me clarify: each hundred block (1-100, 200-299, etc.) contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, up to 400, we have four hundred blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is another 10, making it 50. But wait, 400-488 is part of the 400-499 hundred block, which would contribute another 10 in the tens place. So, total tens place 4's: 50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 40. Hmm, I'm getting conflicting results.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as:\n\nFor each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, for 1-100: 10 times.\n\n200-299: 10 times.\n\n300-399: 10 times.\n\n400-488: How many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0-8. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 times.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 10*4=40.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is part of the 400-499 hundred, so it's only a partial hundred. But in that partial hundred, the tens digit 4 still occurs 10 times (440-449). So, that's 10. So, total tens place 4's: 4*10=40.\n\nWait, but in that case, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times, so adding to the previous 3 hundreds, it's 4*10=40. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, 10. So, 4 hundreds *10=40.\n\nSo, I think my initial count of 40 was correct. So, maybe in the second approach, I made a mistake by thinking that 400-488 contributes an extra 10, but actually, it's part of the 400-499 hundred, which would have 10, but since we're only going up to 488, it's still 10 because 440-449 is within 400-488.\n\nSo, tens place 4's: 40.\n\nThen, hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nUnits place: 48.\n\nSo, total 4's: 40 + 48 +89=177.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 488 /10=48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 8 appears once more (488). So, total units place 8's:48+1=49.\n\n- Tens place: For each hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 1-100:80-89, 10 times.\n\n200-299:280-289, 10 times.\n\n300-399:380-389, 10 times.\n\n400-488:480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's:10+10+10+9=39.\n\n- Hundreds place: 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 0.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+39=88.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 177-88=89.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe I made a mistake in the tens place for 4's, but after rechecking, it's 40, so 177 is correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check once more to be sure.\n\nAnother way: let's calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: floor(488/10)=48, plus if the last digit is >=4, add 1 if the remainder is >=4. Wait, 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so units place 4's:48 +1=49? Wait, no, because in the units place, 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in units place? It's floor((488 +1)/10) *1, but actually, it's the number of complete decades plus 1 if the remainder is >=4.\n\nWait, perhaps a better formula is: the number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is floor(N/10) + (1 if (N % 10) >= d else 0).\n\nWait, but for digit 4, up to 488:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place: floor(488/10)=48. Since 488 mod 10=8 >=4, add 1: total 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, so which is correct?\n\nWait, let's take a smaller example: up to 40.\n\nFrom 1-40, how many 4's in units place? 4,14,24,34,44. Wait, but 44 is beyond 40, so only up to 34. So, 4,14,24,34: 4 times. Using the formula: floor(40/10)=4, 40 mod10=0 <4, so total 4. Correct.\n\nAnother example: up to 48.\n\nUnits place 4's:4,14,24,34,44:5 times. Using formula: floor(48/10)=4, 48 mod10=8 >=4, so 4+1=5. Correct.\n\nSo, applying this to 488:\n\nUnits place 4's: floor(488/10)=48, 488 mod10=8 >=4, so 48+1=49.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 48, but it's actually 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: floor(488/10)=48, 488 mod10=8 >=8, so 48+1=49. That's correct.\n\nSo, I think I made a mistake earlier in counting the units place 4's as 48 instead of 49.\n\nWait, so let's correct that.\n\nSo, 4's:\n\n- Units place:49\n\n- Tens place:40\n\n- Hundreds place:89\n\nTotal 4's:49+40+89=178\n\nWait, that's different. Wait, no, wait. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, no, the hundreds place is 89, which is correct.\n\nBut wait, units place is 49, tens place is 40, hundreds place is 89. So, 49+40=89, plus 89 is 178.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 177. So, I must have made a mistake in the units place.\n\nWait, let's go through it again.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place: floor(488/10)=48, remainder=8. Since 8>=4, add 1: 49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in units place: floor(488/10)=48, remainder=8>=8, so add 1:49.\n\nSo, units place 4's:49, units place 8's:49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4's: floor(488/100)=4, remainder=88. For each hundred, 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4*10=40. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (400-488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's the same as floor((88 +1)/100)*10 + something? Wait, perhaps better to think of it as in the last partial hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place from 400-488? It's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10. So, total tens place 4's:4*10 +10=50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 40. Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing the formula.\n\nWait, using the formula for tens place:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in tens place up to N:\n\nhigher = N / 100\n\ncurrent = (N /10) %10\n\nlower = N %10\n\nif current > d: count += (higher +1)*10\n\nelse if current ==d: count += (higher +1)*10 - (lower +1)\n\nelse: count += higher *10\n\nWait, maybe that's a better way.\n\nLet me try for digit 4 in tens place up to 488.\n\nhigher = 488 /100 =4\n\ncurrent = (488 /10) %10=48%10=8\n\nlower=488%10=8\n\nSo, digit d=4.\n\nSince current=8 >4, so count += (higher +1)*10 = (4+1)*10=50.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's:50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place:\n\nhigher=4\n\ncurrent=8\n\nlower=8\n\nd=8.\n\nSince current=8 >=8, count += (higher +1)*10 - (lower +1)=5*10 - (8+1)=50-9=41.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 39. Hmm, perhaps this formula is more accurate.\n\nWait, let's apply this formula step by step.\n\nFor 4's in tens place:\n\nhigher = 488 // 100 =4\n\ncurrent = (488 //10) %10 =48%10=8\n\nlower =488%10=8\n\nd=4.\n\nSince current >d, so count += (higher +1)*10=5*10=50.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's:50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place:\n\nhigher=4\n\ncurrent=8\n\nlower=8\n\nd=8.\n\nSince current >=d, count += (higher +1)*10 - (lower +1)=5*10 -9=50-9=41.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 39. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake before.\n\nWait, let me think: from 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nIn each hundred, 10 times: 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n\nSo, up to 400, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40.\n\nThen, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, it's 41. Hmm, discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is not correctly applied.\n\nWait, let's check the formula again.\n\nThe formula for the number of times digit d appears in the tens place up to N is:\n\ncount = higher *10\n\nif current > d: count +=10\n\nelif current ==d: count += lower +1\n\nelse: count remains same.\n\nWait, maybe I got the formula wrong earlier.\n\nLet me check a reference: the standard digit counting formula.\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the tens place up to N can be calculated as:\n\n- Split N into higher, current, lower.\n\n- higher = N // 100\n\n- current = (N //10) %10\n\n- lower = N %10\n\nThen:\n\nif current > d: count = (higher +1)*10\n\nelif current ==d: count = higher*10 + lower +1\n\nelse: count = higher*10\n\nSo, for d=8 in tens place up to 488:\n\nhigher=4\n\ncurrent=8\n\nlower=8\n\nSince current ==d=8, count = higher*10 + lower +1=4*10 +8+1=40+9=49.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, total 8's in tens place:49.\n\nWait, but earlier when I used the formula, I thought it was 41, but that was a mistake in applying the formula. The correct count is 49.\n\nSimilarly, for d=4 in tens place:\n\nhigher=4\n\ncurrent=8\n\nlower=8\n\nSince current>4, count=(higher +1)*10=5*10=50.\n\nSo, 4's in tens place:50.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in tens place:49.\n\nSo, let's correct the earlier counts.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place:49\n\n- Tens place:50\n\n- Hundreds place:89\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nWait, that's different. Wait, earlier I thought it was 177, but with this formula, it's 188. Hmm, I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's check again.\n\nWait, using the formula:\n\nFor 4's in units place:\n\nhigher=488//10=48\n\ncurrent=(488//10)%10=8\n\nlower=488%10=8\n\nd=4.\n\nSince current=8 >4, count=higher +1=48 +1=49.\n\nSo, units place 4's:49.\n\nTens place:\n\nhigher=4\n\ncurrent=8\n\nlower=8\n\nd=4.\n\nSince current>4, count=(4+1)*10=50.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each has a 4 in hundreds place, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place:\n\nhigher=48\n\ncurrent=8\n\nlower=8\n\nd=8.\n\nSince current=8 >=8, count=higher +1=48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nhigher=4\n\ncurrent=8\n\nlower=8\n\nd=8.\n\nSince current=8 >=8, count=higher*10 + lower +1=4*10 +8 +1=40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because earlier I thought 8's were 88. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in applying the formula.\n\nWait, no, let's see:\n\nWait, for 8's in tens place up to 488, using the formula, it's 49. But earlier, when I counted manually, I thought it was 39. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let's list the 8's in the tens place up to 488.\n\nFrom 1-100:80-89:10 numbers.\n\nFrom 200-299:280-289:10 numbers.\n\nFrom 300-399:380-389:10 numbers.\n\nFrom 400-488:480-488:9 numbers.\n\nSo, total 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nBut according to the formula, it's 49. So, there's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misapplying the formula.\n\nWait, let's use the formula correctly.\n\nFor d=8 in tens place up to N=488:\n\nhigher = 488 // 100 =4\n\ncurrent = (488 //10) %10=48%10=8\n\nlower=488%10=8\n\nSince current ==d=8, count=higher*10 + lower +1=4*10 +8 +1=40+9=49.\n\nBut when I manually count, it's 39. So, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula counts from 0-488, but the actual count is from 1-488. So, maybe the formula includes 0, which isn't part of the page numbers. So, perhaps we need to adjust.\n\nWait, page numbers start at 1, so 0 isn't included. So, maybe the formula overcounts by 1 in some cases.\n\nWait, let's check for d=8 in tens place up to 488:\n\nFrom 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in tens place?\n\nFrom 1-100:80-89:10\n\n200-299:280-289:10\n\n300-399:380-389:10\n\n400-488:480-488:9\n\nTotal:39.\n\nBut formula gives 49. So, the formula is incorrect in this context because it's counting from 0-488, but we're only interested in 1-488.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is designed for numbers starting at 0, so we need to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should not use the formula and instead count manually.\n\nGiven that, I think the manual count is more accurate in this case, giving 39 8's in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in tens place, using the formula, it's 50, but when I manually count, it's 40.\n\nWait, no, earlier I thought it was 50, but when I manually count, it's 40. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to reconcile this.\n\nWait, let's take a smaller example to test the formula.\n\nSuppose N=88.\n\nHow many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nFrom 1-88:\n\n40-49:10\n\nSo, total 10.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nhigher=88//100=0\n\ncurrent=(88//10)%10=8\n\nlower=88%10=8\n\nd=4.\n\nSince current=8>4, count=(0+1)*10=10.\n\nWhich matches manual count.\n\nSimilarly, for N=148:\n\nhigher=1\n\ncurrent=4\n\nlower=8\n\nd=4.\n\nSince current=4==4, count=1*10 +8 +1=19.\n\nWait, but from 1-148, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49 (10) and 140-148 (9). So, total 19. So, formula works here.\n\nWait, but in our case, N=488.\n\nFor d=4 in tens place:\n\nhigher=4\n\ncurrent=8\n\nlower=8\n\nSince current>4, count=(4+1)*10=50.\n\nBut manually, we have:\n\nFrom 1-400:40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449:5 sets of 10, so 50.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 is correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 40. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, so 4's in tens place:50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place up to 488:\n\nhigher=4\n\ncurrent=8\n\nlower=8\n\nd=8.\n\nSince current==d, count=4*10 +8 +1=40+9=49.\n\nBut manually, I count 39.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is including 0-88 as well, but we're only considering 1-488.\n\nWait, no, the formula should be correct if applied properly.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is correct, and my manual count is wrong.\n\nWait, let's think: from 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nFrom 1-100:80-89:10\n\n200-299:280-289:10\n\n300-399:380-389:10\n\n400-488:480-488:9\n\nTotal:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nBut formula says 49. So, discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula counts from 0-488, which includes 0-88 in the first hundred, which would have 9 numbers with tens digit 8 (80-88), but in reality, from 1-100, it's 10 numbers (80-89). So, maybe the formula is correct, and my manual count is wrong.\n\nWait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but 480-489 would be 10. Since we only go up to 488, it's 9.\n\nBut the formula counts 49, which would include 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488, which is 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9, so total 49.\n\nWait, but that's 49. So, perhaps my manual count was wrong, and it's actually 49.\n\nWait, but from 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9.\n\nSo, 10 (1-100) +10 (200-299)+10 ("

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should start by counting how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me think about how digits are counted in numbers. For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), I can calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear separately. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). \n\nIn each group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8 (8, 18, 28, etc.). So for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1, which is 48, plus any extra in the last partial group. In the last group, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So adding that, units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49, and units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but actually, when we have 488 pages, the last page is 488, so the units digits go up to 8. So in the last group, 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So yes, units place for both 4 and 8 have 49 occurrences each.\n\nNext, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly for 8 (80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\nNow, how many hundreds do we have in 488 pages? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times. So, for each hundred, the number of times 4 appears in the tens place is 10, and same for 8.\n\nBut wait, let me think carefully. The book has 488 pages, so we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages in the 401-488 range. \n\nIn each full hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times, so 10 times each digit. So for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times. Since there are 4 full hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 for 4's and 4*10 = 40 for 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, in the last partial hundred, which is from 401 to 488, how many times do 4 and 8 appear in the tens place? The tens digit here is 0 (for 401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490). But since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears from 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), but wait, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 4 occurs when the tens place is 4, which would be 440-449, but since we're only going up to 488, 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, right? So that's 10 times. \n\nSimilarly, for the tens digit 8, it occurs in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the last partial hundred.\n\nWait, no, actually, from 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So when the tens digit is 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in the last partial hundred. For 8, when the tens digit is 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the last partial hundred.\n\nSo adding that to the full hundreds: 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 (from last partial hundred) = 50 for 4's in the tens place, and 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 (from last partial hundred) = 49 for 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Each full hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.) contributes 10 times each digit in the tens place. So 4 full hundreds give 4*10=40 for 4's and 4*10=40 for 8's. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (440-449), and 8 occurs 9 times (480-488). So total for tens place: 40+10=50 for 4's and 40+9=49 for 8's.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place, right? Because each of those 9 numbers has 8 in the tens place. So yes, 9 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each digit place.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- Each 10 pages, 4 appears once, so 488/10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Then in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred, 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So 4 full hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10=40 for 4's and 4*10=40 for 8's.\n- Then, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. For 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. For 8 in the tens place, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times.\n- So total tens place: 40+10=50 for 4's and 40+9=49 for 8's.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up:\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When calculating the units place, I considered 488 as the last page, so the units digits go from 1 to 8 in the last partial group. So 4 appears once and 8 appears once. But what about page 488 itself? Its units digit is 8, so that's included. Similarly, page 484 has units digit 4, which is included.\n\nAnother thing to check: in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times, correct. And 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 times, correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 pages, correct.\n\nSo I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - There are 48 full groups of 10 in 488, contributing 48 occurrences each for 4 and 8.\n   - The last 8 numbers (481-488) add 1 more 4 (484) and 1 more 8 (488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - 4 full hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 occurrences each for 4 and 8.\n   - In 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 fours. But wait, in the last partial group from 481 to 488, the units digit 4 appears once (at 484). So, total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically from 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349) and a partial block from 440-449, which is actually the fifth block. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's would be 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is only 10 pages, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, contributing 89 fours.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, that's 48 complete groups of 10, giving 48 eights. But wait, in the last partial group from 481-488, the units digit 8 appears once at 488. So, units place eights are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. How many such blocks are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete blocks. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800 onwards, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no hundreds place eights. So, zero eights here.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 89 eights.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (fours) - 89 (eights) = 99.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFor units place 4's: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, plus one more in 484. So, 49. Correct.\n\nTens place 4's: From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place 4's: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Correct.\n\nUnits place 8's: 48 full tens, plus one in 488. So, 49. Correct.\n\nTens place 8's: Four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each with 10 numbers, so 40. Correct.\n\nHundreds place 8's: None, since 488 < 800. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 40 = 89. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 89 = 99. So, there are 99 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 4.\n   - Total groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full groups, plus one more in 484.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Number of such blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Total 4's: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 8.\n   - Total groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full groups, plus one more in 488.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Number of such blocks: 4 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389).\n   - Each block has 10 numbers, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 89.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's minus number of 8's: 188 - 89 = 99.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{99}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. \n\nFirst, let's consider the units place. For every set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, how many such sets are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of ten and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488). In each full set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 numbers, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so there's no 4 in the units place here. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nNext, the tens place. Similarly, in every set of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). So, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an extra 88 pages (401-488). In each full hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so that's 4 times 10 = 40. Now, in the extra 88 pages, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Let's see, 440-449 would have 10 instances, but wait, 488 is only up to 488, so from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in the 440-449 range. That's 10 numbers, so 10 more 4's in the tens place. So total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each place: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. As before, in every set of ten numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. There are 48 full sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers. So, 48 times in the units place from the full sets. In the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once here (at 488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. In every set of 100 numbers, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89). There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, etc.), so 4 times 10 = 40. Now, in the extra 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles. Let's see, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490, but wait, 488 is the end. So, the tens digit is 8 in 481-488. How many numbers is that? From 481 to 488, that's 8 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 8 more 8's in the tens place. Wait, but wait, 481-488 is 8 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all 8 of them, so that's 8 times. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) + 8 = 48.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (48) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit is 8 only once (at 488), so 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each full hundred contributes 10, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 more. So, 40 + 8 = 48. That seems right.\n\nHundreds place: Since 488 is less than 800, no 8's there.\n\nSo total 8's: 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 187 and 8's are 97, so the difference would be 187 - 97 = 90. Hmm, but let me check again because sometimes I might have made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, 4's: in each full hundred, 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, 40 + 10 = 50. That's correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 times, correct.\n\nSo 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 48 full tens, each with one 8, so 48. Then, in 481-488, units digit 8 appears once, so 49 total.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in 401-488, tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 more, making 48. So, 49 (units) + 48 (tens) = 97.\n\nSo, 187 - 97 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when counting digits, especially in the hundreds place, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nWait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place, 4's: in each hundred, 40-49, so 10 times per hundred. 4 hundreds, so 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10. So, 40 + 10 = 50. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 times, correct.\n\nSo, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in 481-488, units digit 8 appears once, so 49.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8. So, 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nSo, 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nDifference: 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check again.\n\nIn the tens place, for 8's:\n\nEach hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so 10 per hundred. So, 4 hundreds would give 40.\n\nNow, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, how many times does the tens digit 8 appear? It's from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's from 480-488. So, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. But wait, 480 has tens digit 8, right? So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so 9 times the tens digit is 8. Wait, so earlier I thought it was 8, but actually, it's 9.\n\nWait, let me recount: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, earlier I had 40 + 8 = 48, but it should be 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, so that changes things. So, total 8's in the tens place would be 49, and units place is 49 as well. So, total 8's would be 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, that's different. So, let me correct that.\n\nSo, units place: 49.\n\nTens place: 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so now, 4's are 187, 8's are 98, so the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier by miscalculating the number of 8's in the tens place. It's actually 9, not 8, because from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, each with tens digit 8. So, that adds 9 more 8's in the tens place, making it 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nSo, difference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this because it's easy to make off-by-one errors.\n\nSo, in the tens place for 8's:\n\n- Each full hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.) contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds give 40.\n\n- In the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 more 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in 481-488, units digit 8 appears once (at 488), so 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nSo, 4's: 187, 8's: 98, difference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 187, but let me check that again.\n\n4's:\n\n- Units place: 48.\n\n- Tens place: 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal: 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 8's: 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the answer was 90, but now it's 89. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the 8's in the tens place. Let me recount.\n\nIn the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers. So, 9 times the tens digit is 8.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nUnits place: 48 (from full tens) + 1 (from 488) = 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 4's: 187, 8's: 98, difference: 89.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the 4's count. Let me check again.\n\n4's in the hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\n4's in the tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (40-49), so 4 hundreds give 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n4's in the units place: Each set of ten has one 4, so 48 full sets give 48. Then, in the last partial set, 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so no 4. So, 48.\n\nSo, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nSo, 8's: 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nSo, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought it was 90, but now it's 89. Let me make sure I didn't double-count or miss a number.\n\nWait, perhaps the page numbers start at 1, so 400 is included, but 488 is included as well. So, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, correct.\n\nIn the tens place for 8's, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, correct.\n\nSo, 40 + 9 = 49 in the tens place for 8's.\n\nUnits place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSo, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by thinking about how digits are counted in numbers. For each position in the page number (units, tens, hundreds), I can calculate how many times each digit appears. \n\nFirst, let's consider the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in a sequence of numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does each digit appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place. So, I can figure out how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488, and then see if there's a partial group.\n\nWait, but actually, since page numbers start at 1, the first page is 1, not 0. So, maybe I need to adjust for that. Let me think. From 1 to 488, the number of complete tens is 48 full tens (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8). So, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times in the units place. But wait, since we start at 1, does that affect the count? Hmm, because page 1 is 1, page 2 is 2, up to page 10, which is 10. So, in the units place, digits 1 through 9 each appear once in the first 9 pages, and 0 appears once at page 10. So, perhaps my initial thought was correct.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to calculate for each digit position separately. Let me try that.\n\nLet's break it down by each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor each digit from 0 to 9, how many times does it appear in the units place from 1 to 488?\n\nWell, every 10 numbers, each digit appears once in the units place. So, the number of complete groups of 10 is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8). So, each digit appears 48 times in the units place. But wait, starting from 1, the first group is 1-10, which has digits 1-0 in the units place. So, digit 0 appears once in the units place at page 10. Similarly, in each subsequent group of 10, each digit from 0-9 appears once in the units place.\n\nSo, for units place, the count for each digit is 48 times. But wait, 488 is not a multiple of 10, so there's an extra 8 pages beyond 480. So, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1-8. So, in the units place, digits 1-8 each appear once more, and digits 9-0 don't appear in this partial group.\n\nSo, for the units place, the count for each digit is 48 times, plus an additional 1 for digits 1-8. So, for digit 4, units place count is 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, for digit 8, units place count is 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. So, from 1 to 480, each digit appears 48 times in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, digits 1-8 each get one more count, and digits 9 and 0 don't. So, yes, digits 1-8 have 49 counts in the units place, and digits 9 and 0 have 48 counts.\n\nOkay, so for units place:\n- 4 appears 49 times\n- 8 appears 49 times\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each block of 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 0 appears in 1-9 and 10, but wait, actually, in the tens place, 0 appears from 1-9, but 10 has a 1 in the tens place. Wait, maybe I should think differently.\n\nWait, actually, in the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each block of 100. So, for example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), ..., up to 9 (90-99). So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for each 100 numbers.\n\nBut since our total is 488, which is less than 500, we can consider the tens place from 1-488.\n\nSo, the number of complete hundreds is 4 (since 400 is the nearest hundred below 488). Wait, actually, 488 is 4*100 + 88, so up to 488, we have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488.\n\nSo, in each hundred block, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 complete hundreds, each digit appears 4*10 = 40 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's look at the remaining 88 pages: 401-488.\n\nIn this range, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, let's count how many times each digit appears in the tens place from 401-488.\n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit is 0, so 0 appears 10 times (401-410).\nFrom 411-420: tens digit is 1, so 1 appears 10 times.\n...\nFrom 481-490: tens digit is 8, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 times (481-488).\n\nWait, but wait, 401-488 is 88 pages. So, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-488). So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears in the tens place, but the number of times varies.\n\nSpecifically, from 401-410: 10 numbers, tens digit 0.\nFrom 411-420: 10 numbers, tens digit 1.\n...\nFrom 471-480: 10 numbers, tens digit 7.\nFrom 481-488: 8 numbers, tens digit 8.\n\nSo, digits 0-7 each appear 10 times in the tens place, and digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place from 401-488, digit 0:10, 1:10, 2:10, ..., 7:10, 8:8.\n\nSo, adding to the previous 40 times from the complete hundreds, the total for each digit in the tens place is:\n\n- Digits 0-7: 40 + 10 = 50\n- Digits 8: 40 + 8 = 48\n- Digit 9: 40 (since 9 doesn't appear in the tens place in 401-488)\n\nWait, but wait, 401-488 is 88 numbers, so the tens digits go up to 8, so digit 9 doesn't appear in the tens place here. So, yes, digit 9 in the tens place only appears in the 300s, 400s, etc., but in 401-488, the tens digits only go up to 8.\n\nWait, but wait, in the 300s, like 301-400, the tens digits go up to 9 (390-399). But since we're only considering up to 488, the tens digits in 401-488 go up to 8.\n\nWait, no, in 401-488, the tens digits are 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., 8 (481-488). So, digits 0-8 each appear in the tens place, with 8 appearing only 8 times because we stop at 488.\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n\n- For digits 0-7: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50\n- For digit 8: 40 (from 1-400) + 8 (from 401-488) = 48\n- For digit 9: 40 (from 1-400) + 0 (since 401-488 doesn't include 9 in tens place) = 40\n\nWait, but wait, in 1-400, the tens digit for 9 appears in 90-99, 190-199, 290-299, 390-399. So, each hundred block contributes 10 times for each digit, so 4 blocks would be 40 times for digit 9 in the tens place. But in 401-488, digit 9 doesn't appear in the tens place, so yes, digit 9 in tens place is 40 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place:\n\n- 4 appears 50 times (since 4 is one of 0-7)\n- 8 appears 48 times\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, each digit from 1 to 4 appears in the hundreds place for 100 numbers each, except for the last one if the total is less than a full hundred.\n\nWait, from 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (since they are two-digit numbers). From 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, 200-299: 2, 300-399:3, 400-488:4.\n\nSo, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\n- Digit 1: 100 times (100-199)\n- Digit 2: 100 times (200-299)\n- Digit 3: 100 times (300-399)\n- Digit 4: 89 times (400-488, which is 89 numbers)\n- Digits 0,5-9: 0 times in the hundreds place\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times\n- 8 appears 0 times\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for 4 and 8 across all digit positions.\n\nFor digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nWait, so 188 (4's) minus 97 (8's) equals 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- 4 appears 49 times\n- 8 appears 49 times\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4 appears 50 times\n- 8 appears 48 times\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times\n- 8 appears 0 times\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAnd in the tens place, for 401-488, digit 8 appears 8 times, so adding to the 40 from 1-400, that's 48 times. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the units place, from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once more in the units place beyond the 48 times, making it 49. Similarly for 4, it's 49.\n\nSo, yes, the counts seem accurate. Therefore, the difference is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but wait a second, let me think again about the tens place for digit 8. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nIn each hundred block, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), so for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10=40 times. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 numbers, meaning the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers, not 8. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 8 numbers. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there.\n\nWait, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, the tens digit is 8 for all these 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, digit 8 appears 9 times in 401-488, not 8 times. So, that changes the count.\n\nSo, in the tens place, digit 8 appears 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49 times, not 48.\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, I must have miscalculated before.\n\nLet me correct that.\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place:\n\n- Digit 8: 40 + 9 = 49 times\n\nSimilarly, digits 0-7 in the tens place from 401-488:\n\nFrom 401-410: 10 numbers, tens digit 0\n411-420: 10 numbers, tens digit 1\n...\n471-480: 10 numbers, tens digit 7\n480-488: 9 numbers, tens digit 8\n\nSo, digits 0-7 each appear 10 times in the tens place in 401-488, except digit 8, which appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is 88 numbers. Let's check: 401-488 is 88 pages, right? 488 - 401 + 1 = 88.\n\nNow, if we have 8 groups of 10 in the tens place (from 0 to 8), that would be 9 groups, but the last group is only 9 numbers instead of 10. So, digits 0-7 each appear 10 times, and digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place:\n\n- Digits 0-7: 10 times each\n- Digit 8: 9 times\n\nTherefore, in the tens place, digit 8 appears 9 times in 401-488, so total 40 (from 1-400) + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought digit 8 in the tens place was 48 times, but now it's 49. So, that changes the total count for 8's.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 4 in the tens place, since 4 is among digits 0-7, it appears 10 times in 401-488, so total 40 + 10 = 50 times, which was correct.\n\nSo, let's recalculate the totals.\n\nFor digit 4:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor digit 8:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, so the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought digit 8 in the tens place was 48, but now it's 49, so the total 8's are 98 instead of 97, making the difference 90 instead of 91.\n\nWait, so where did I go wrong earlier? I think I miscounted the number of times 8 appears in the tens place in 401-488. It's actually 9 times, not 8, because 480-488 is 9 numbers, so digit 8 in the tens place appears 9 times, making the total 49 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me confirm again.\n\nIn the tens place, from 401-488:\n\n- 401-410: 10 numbers, tens digit 0\n- 411-420: 10 numbers, tens digit 1\n- 421-430: 10 numbers, tens digit 2\n- 431-440: 10 numbers, tens digit 3\n- 441-450: 10 numbers, tens digit 4\n- 451-460: 10 numbers, tens digit 5\n- 461-470: 10 numbers, tens digit 6\n- 471-480: 10 numbers, tens digit 7\n- 481-488: 8 numbers, tens digit 8\n\nWait, hold on, 481-488 is 8 numbers, not 9. Because 488 - 481 + 1 = 8. So, 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers, not 9.\n\nSo, that means in the tens place, digit 8 appears 8 times in 401-488, not 9. Therefore, my initial calculation was correct with 8 times, making the total for 8 in the tens place 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake in counting the numbers from 481-488. Let me recount:\n\n481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers, not 9.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place, digit 8 appears 8 times in 401-488, so total 40 + 8 = 48 times.\n\nThus, the total for 8's is:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 48\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 48 = 97\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, so I think I confused myself earlier by miscounting the numbers in 481-488. It's 8 numbers, so digit 8 in the tens place appears 8 times, not 9. Therefore, the total number of 8's is 97, and 4's are 188, so the difference is 91.\n\nWait, but let me make sure again.\n\nFrom 481 to 488, inclusive, that's 8 numbers:\n\n481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488.\n\nYes, that's 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers, meaning digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place in 401-488.\n\nTherefore, the total for 8 in the tens place is 40 (from 1-400) + 8 = 48.\n\nSo, 8's total: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) = 97.\n\n4's total: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 481-488 was 9 numbers, but it's actually 8. So, the correct count is 8 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just cross-verify with another approach.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately in each digit position.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFor units digit:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears floor(488/10) = 48 times, plus an extra for digits 1-8 because 488 mod 10 is 8.\n\nSo, units digit count for 4: 48 + 1 = 49\nSimilarly for 8: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nTens place:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears floor(488/100)*10 = 4*10 = 40 times.\n\nThen, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-8, with each digit 0-7 appearing 10 times, and 8 appearing 8 times.\n\nSo, for tens place:\n\n4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly digits 1-4 appear, with 4 appearing 89 times (400-488), and 8 not appearing at all.\n\nSo, hundreds place:\n\n4's: 89\n8's: 0\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the number of times the digits 4 and 8 appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place from 1 to 480.\n   - From 481 to 488, digits 1-8 each appear once more.\n   - **Count for 4:** 48 + 1 = 49\n   - **Count for 8:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times per hundred, totaling 40 times from 1 to 400.\n   - From 401 to 488, digits 0-7 each appear 10 times, and digit 8 appears 8 times.\n   - **Count for 4:** 40 + 10 = 50\n   - **Count for 8:** 40 + 8 = 48\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Digit 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - Digit 8 does not appear.\n   - **Count for 4:** 89\n   - **Count for 8:** 0\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - **8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 91.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense. \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, the units place. In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of ten and then a partial set of 8 numbers (481 to 488). So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times for each full set, plus one more in the partial set (484). So that's 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers each time. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are four full hundreds, each contributing one block of ten 4's in the tens place. That's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 times. But wait, the last block is 440-449, and since 488 is beyond 449, that block is entirely included. So, 40 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for 100 consecutive numbers: 400-499. But our book only goes up to 488, so from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. Therefore, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the occurrences of 4 in each place: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 = 89, plus 89 is 178. So, the digit 4 appears 178 times.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. Starting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in every set of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full sets of ten are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets and a partial set of 8 numbers (481-488). So, 48 times in the units place, plus one more in 488, so 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers each time, like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Each full block contributes 10 times, and the last block contributes 9 times. So, how many full blocks are there? From 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's four blocks, each contributing 10 times, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Plus the last partial block from 480-488, which is 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for 100 consecutive numbers: 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, the digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all.\n\nAdding up the occurrences of 8 in each place: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 178 - 98 = 80.\n\nWait, let me double-check that subtraction. 178 minus 98. 178 - 90 is 88, then subtract 8 more: 80. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the digit 4 appears 80 times more than the digit 8 in the page numbers of the book.\n</think>\n\nThe digit 4 appears 178 times, while the digit 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 178 - 98 = 80.\n\n\\boxed{80}"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense. \n\nLet me start by considering the positions where digits can appear: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I think I should analyze each digit position separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, in 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each set of 10, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place.\n\nNow, how many full sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 full sets of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in each of the 48 full sets, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place, so that's 48 times each. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once and 8 appears once in the units place here as well. So, total for units place: 48 + 1 = 49 times for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 times for 8. So, in the units place, both digits appear 49 times. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in a block of 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (11-20), 2 (21-30), and so on up to 9 (91-100). So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place over 100 numbers.\n\nBut in our case, the book goes up to 488, which is less than 500, so we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, for each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.), the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89, 180-189, etc.) So, for each hundred, 4 and 8 each have 10 occurrences in the tens place.\n\nNow, how many full hundreds are there in 488? Well, 400 is the start of the fourth hundred, and we go up to 488, so that's 401-488, which is 88 numbers. So, in the fourth hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, let's see: from 401-409, the tens digit is 0; 410-419, it's 1; and so on up to 480-488, where the tens digit is 8.\n\nSo, in the tens place, for 401-488, how many times does 4 appear? Well, 40-49 is in the first hundred, but in the fourth hundred, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, 8 in the tens place occurs in 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480 to 488 is 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 times. Hmm, so in the tens place for the last partial hundred (401-488), 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake here. Let me correct that. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. When the tens digit is 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in this partial hundred.\n\nSo, now, for the first three full hundreds (1-300), each has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, that's 3 * 10 = 30 for 4 and 30 for 8. Then, in the fourth hundred (401-488), 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times. So, total for tens place: 30 + 10 = 40 for 4, and 30 + 9 = 39 for 8. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 40 times and 8 appears 39 times, so the difference here is 1.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check that again. The first three hundreds (1-300) each have 10 occurrences of 4 and 8 in the tens place, so that's 3*10=30 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit for 4 is 440-449, which is 10 times, and for 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 times. So, total for tens place: 30 + 10 = 40 for 4, and 30 + 9 = 39 for 8. So, 40 - 39 = 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I counted correctly. Let me think again. In the first three hundreds, each has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so that's correct. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit for 4 is 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. For 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So yes, that's correct. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 40 times, and 8 appears 39 times. So, the difference is +1 for 4.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. How about 8? Well, in the hundreds place, 8 would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and 8 appears 0 times. So, that's a difference of +89 for 4.\n\nWait, that seems significant. So, let me confirm. Pages 400-488 have the hundreds digit as 4. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so no page numbers in the 800s. So, yes, 89 times for 4 and 0 times for 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let me summarize the counts so far:\n\n- Units place: 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n- Tens place: 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 40 is 89, plus 89 is 178.\n\nTotal number of 8's is 49 (units) + 39 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 39 = 88.\n\nSo, the difference is 178 (number of 4's) minus 88 (number of 8's) equals 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, units place: 48 full sets of 10, each contributing 1 to 4 and 1 to 8, so 48 each. Then, the last 8 numbers (481-488) have 4 and 8 each once, so total 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: For the first three hundreds, each contributes 10 to 4 and 10 to 8, so 30 each. Then, in 401-488, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total 40 for 4 and 39 for 8. That adds up.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 appears 0 times. So, 89 for 4.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 40 is 89, plus 89 is 178.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 39 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 88.\n\nDifference: 178 - 88 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but I thought maybe I made a mistake because 90 seems a large number. Let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the total number of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's.\n\nUnits place: As before, 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the last 8 numbers (481-488) include 484, so that's another 1. So, 49.\n\nTens place: In each hundred, 10 times. So, for 1-300, that's 3*10=30. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so another 10. So, total 30 + 10 = 40.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 40 + 89 = 178.\n\nNow, number of 8's.\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the last 8 numbers include 488, so another 1, making 49.\n\nTens place: In each hundred, 10 times. So, 3*10=30 for 1-300. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, total 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nHundreds place: 8 doesn't appear, so 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 39 + 0 = 88.\n\nDifference: 178 - 88 = 90.\n\nHmm, so that's consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for 400-488. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. Then, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, since 488 is the last page. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to check: The total number of digits printed from 1 to 488.\n\nWait, that might not be necessary, but just to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position.\n\nWait, another approach: For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nTotal numbers: 488.\n\nNumber of complete sets of 10: floor(488/10) = 48 sets, each contributing 1 occurrence of 4 and 1 of 8 in the units place.\n\nRemaining numbers: 488 - (48*10) = 8 numbers, which are 481-488. In these, 484 has a 4 in the units place, and 488 has an 8. So, units place: 48 +1 =49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of complete sets of 100: floor(488/100) =4 sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400).\n\nEach set contributes 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place.\n\nSo, 4 sets *10 =40 each.\n\nNow, the remaining numbers are 401-488, which is 88 numbers. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 and 8 appear?\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8.\n\n- Tens digit 4: occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers.\n- Tens digit 8: occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in the remaining 88 numbers.\n\nSo, total for tens place: 40 +10=50 for 4, and 40 +9=49 for 8.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, earlier I thought that each complete set of 100 contributes 10 to both 4 and 8 in the tens place. So, 4 sets would give 40 each. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit for 4 is 10 times, and for 8, it's 9 times. So, total for 4: 40 +10=50, and for 8: 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier count where I had 40 for 4 and 39 for 8. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The first 400 pages are covered by 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 occurrences of 4 and 8 in the tens place. So, that's 4*10=40 each.\n\nThen, from 401-488, which is 88 pages, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., 8 for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488.\n\nSo, in the tens place:\n\n- Tens digit 4: 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times.\n- Tens digit 8: 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times.\n\nSo, in the partial set, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total for tens place: 40 +10=50 for 4, and 40 +9=49 for 8.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the tens place for 4 was 40, but now it's 50. That's a discrepancy. Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the positions earlier. Let me recast this.\n\nIn the first 400 pages (1-400), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nEach hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) contributes 10 times in the tens place for 4 and 10 times for 8. So, 4 blocks *10=40 each.\n\nThen, from 401-488, which is 88 pages, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8.\n\nSo, in 401-488:\n\n- Tens digit 4: 440-449, which is 10 pages.\n- Tens digit 8: 480-488, which is 9 pages.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in this partial block.\n\nThus, total for tens place:\n\n- 4: 40 (from 1-400) +10=50\n- 8: 40 (from 1-400) +9=49\n\nSo, that's 50 for 4 and 49 for 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 40 and 39. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier by not considering that the first 400 pages include 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 to 4 and 8 in the tens place. So, that's 40 each. Then, in 401-488, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times. So, total for tens place: 40+10=50 for 4, and 40+9=49 for 8.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I thought that in the first three hundreds, it was 30 each, and then in the fourth hundred, 10 for 4 and 9 for 8. So, that would have been 40 for 4 and 39 for 8. But that's incorrect because the first four hundreds (1-400) each contribute 10 to 4 and 8 in the tens place, so 40 each. Then, in 401-488, it's 10 for 4 and 9 for 8. So, total for 4 is 50, and for 8 is 49.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by only counting the first three hundreds as contributing 30 each, but actually, the first four hundreds (1-400) each contribute 10, so 40 each.\n\nSo, let's correct that.\n\nSo, units place: 49 each.\n\nTens place: 50 for 4, 49 for 8.\n\nHundreds place: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but that's the same difference as before, but the counts are different.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, if in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times, then total 4's would be 49+50+89=188, and 8's would be 49+49=98, so difference is 90.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought tens place was 40 for 4 and 39 for 8, I had 4's as 178 and 8's as 88, difference 90. Now, with tens place as 50 and 49, I have 4's as 188 and 8's as 98, difference still 90.\n\nWait, so regardless of how I count, the difference remains 90. So, perhaps the answer is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nIn the units place, 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48, plus the last 8 numbers, where 484 has a 4 in the units place, so total 49.\n\nIn the tens place, 400-488: 440-449 is 10 times, and 480-488 is 9 times. So, in the partial hundred, 10 for 4 and 9 for 8. So, adding to the first 400, which had 40 each, so 50 for 4 and 49 for 8.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought in the tens place, the first three hundreds contributed 30 each, and the fourth hundred contributed 10 for 4 and 9 for 8, leading to 40 for 4 and 39 for 8. But that was incorrect because the first four hundreds each contribute 10 in the tens place for 4 and 8, so 40 each, and then the partial hundred contributes 10 for 4 and 9 for 8, leading to 50 and 49.\n\nSo, perhaps I was correct in the first place, but when I corrected it, I still ended up with the same difference of 90.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can approach this problem by counting the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nWait, another way: For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nTotal numbers: 488.\n\nNumber of times 4 appears: floor(488/10) =48 full cycles, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 484, which is another 1. So, total 49.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears 48 times in the units place in the full cycles, and once in the remaining 8 numbers (488), so total 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place.\n\nNumber of full hundreds: floor(488/100)=4, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 times for 4 and 8 in the tens place, so 4*10=40 each.\n\nNow, the remaining 88 numbers (401-488) have their tens digits from 0 to 8.\n\nIn these, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times for 4.\n\nThe tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times for 8.\n\nSo, total in tens place: 40 +10=50 for 4, and 40 +9=49 for 8.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nThe hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times for 4.\n\n8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the difference was 90, but in another approach, I thought it was 90 again, so perhaps that's correct.\n\nWait, another way to confirm: Let's calculate the total number of 4's and 8's.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99; 99+89=188.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I didn't double-count any numbers. For example, in page 444, the digit 4 appears three times, so each occurrence is counted separately in units, tens, and hundreds place. Similarly, in page 488, 8 appears twice. So, each digit's position is counted separately, so that's correct.\n\nAnother check: The total number of digits printed from 1 to 488.\n\nEach page number is printed once, so:\n\n- Pages 1-9: 1 digit each, 9 pages, so 9 digits.\n- Pages 10-99: 2 digits each, 90 pages, so 180 digits.\n- Pages 100-488: 3 digits each, 389 pages, so 1167 digits.\n\nTotal digits:9 +180 +1167=1356 digits.\n\nNow, total number of 4's:188, and 8's:98.\n\nSo, 188 +98=286 digits accounted for.\n\nTotal digits:1356.\n\nSo, 286 is less than 1356, which is fine, as we're only accounting for 4's and 8's.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can check another way. Let's calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nWait, for units place:\n\nEach digit from 0-9 appears equally, except possibly the last partial set.\n\nSo, 488 pages: units digits cycle every 10 pages.\n\nNumber of complete cycles:48, as 488//10=48, remainder 8.\n\nSo, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place, except for the remaining 8 digits, which are 1-8.\n\nWait, but wait, 488//10=48, so 48 complete cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So, total 49 each. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears 10 times in each block of 100 pages.\n\nNumber of complete hundreds:4, so 4*10=40 for each digit in the tens place.\n\nThen, the remaining 88 pages (401-488) have tens digits from 0-8.\n\nIn these, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nSo, total for tens place:40 +10=50 for 4, and 40 +9=49 for 8.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly the hundreds digit 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nThus, the difference is indeed 90.\n\nSo, after carefully considering each digit position and counting the occurrences of 4 and 8, I conclude that there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place from pages 1 to 480.\n   - Pages 481-488 add one more 4 and one more 8.\n   - Total: 49 each.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times per hundred, totaling 40 times for each digit in the first 400 pages.\n   - Pages 401-488 add 10 occurrences of 4 (440-449) and 9 occurrences of 8 (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 for 4, 49 for 8.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Only pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, totaling 89 times.\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nSumming up:\n- **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the first step is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by considering the different places where digits can appear: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll need to calculate the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each of these positions separately and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once, and the same goes for 8. For example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So 4 appears once, and 8 appears once. \n\nNow, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and then an extra 8 pages (481 to 488). In each of these 48 sets, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So that's 48 times each. Now, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, here, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, adding that, units place contributes 49 times for 4 and 49 times for 8.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full tens and then 8 more numbers. So, in the units place, each full ten contributes one 4 and one 8. So, 48 times each. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So total units place: 48 +1 = 49 for 4, and 48 +1 = 49 for 8. So, units place contributes equally to both digits.\n\nMoving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: 40-49, and similarly, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: 80-89. \n\nNow, since the book has 488 pages, which is less than 500, we have four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, actually, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, let me correct that: the hundreds are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? \n\nIn each hundred, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 times. So, in 1-100, that's 10 times. Similarly, in 101-200, the tens digit is 4 in 140-149, which is another 10 times. Same for 201-300: 240-249, another 10 times. And in 301-400: 340-349, another 10 times. Now, in 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total times 4 appears in the tens place: 10 (from 1-100) +10 (101-200) +10 (201-300) +10 (301-400) +10 (401-488) = 50 times.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place: in each hundred, 80-89, which is 10 times. So, in 1-100: 10 times, 101-200: 10 times, 201-300:10 times, 301-400:10 times, and in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but 480-489 is 10 numbers, but we only have up to 488, so it's 9 numbers. So, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total for 8 in the tens place: 10 (1-100) +10 (101-200) +10 (201-300) +10 (301-400) +9 (401-488) = 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 1-100, 80-89 is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, each subsequent hundred up to 301-400 would have another 10 each. So, that's 4 sets, each contributing 10, so 40 times. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total for 8 in tens place: 40 +9 =49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times. So, 4 has one more occurrence here.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 -400 +1 =89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about 8? The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, summing up the hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's add up all the occurrences.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 +50 +89 = 188 times.\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal: 49 +49 +0 =98 times.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98 =90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, units place: 488 pages. For units digit, each ten has one 4 and one 8. 488 divided by 10 is 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48+1=49 for 4, and 48+1=49 for 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9. So, in each hundred, 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (40-49), same with 8 (80-89). So, in 1-100, 10 each. Then, 101-200: another 10 each, and so on up to 301-400: another 10 each. So, up to 400, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 for 4 and 10 for 8. So, 40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8. So, 4 in the tens place occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more for 4. For 8, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, 4's tens place: 40 +10=50. 8's tens place:40 +9=49. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up: 4's total: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188. 8's total:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98. Difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I think about page 400, that's a three-digit number, so the hundreds digit is 4, and the tens and units digits are 0. So, that's correct. Similarly, page 488 has 4 in the hundreds place, 8 in the tens, and 8 in the units.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place in 401-488. So, 401-488: the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 4, that's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. When the tens digit is 8, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, yes, 9 times.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's tens place:50, 8's tens place:49.\n\nSo, the total counts are correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each set of ten consecutive numbers (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) has exactly one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full sets of ten in 488 pages, contributing 48 each.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488).\n   - Total: 49 each.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - In each hundred (e.g., 1-100), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49) and 8 for 10 numbers (80-89).\n   - Up to page 400, there are 4 hundreds, contributing 40 each.\n   - Pages 401-488 add 10 more 4's (440-449) and 9 more 8's (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 for 4, 49 for 8.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n   - The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\n**Total Counts**:\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference**: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI remember that to count the number of times a specific digit appears, I need to look at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. So, I'll have to calculate how many times the digit 4 and 8 appear in each of these places and then sum them up. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times a specific digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then considering any remainder.\n\nBut wait, the book has 488 pages, so 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. That means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 pages and then 8 extra pages. In each complete block, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48, and the number of 8's is also 48. But we have 8 extra pages, which are 481 to 488. In these, the units digits are 1 through 8. So, in the units place of these extra pages, 8 appears once more, but 4 doesn't appear because 484 would be in the units place, but 484 is page 484, which is within the 481-488 range. Wait, no, 484 is page 484, which is within 481-488. So, in the units place, 4 appears once more, and 8 appears once more in these extra pages. So, in total, units place for 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, and for 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so the units digits go up to 8. Let me check again. From 1 to 480, there are 48 blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times each. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in this range, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, they are equal in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each block of 100. So, for example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, in each block of 100, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSince the book has 488 pages, that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). Wait, no, 401-488 is 88 pages, but the tens digit in this range will vary. Let me think carefully.\n\nFirst, for the tens place, in each hundred block, each digit appears 10 times. So, for the first 400 pages, there are 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 times the digit in the tens place. So, for 4's in the tens place: 4 blocks * 10 = 40 times. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place: 4 blocks * 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, the remaining pages are 401-488. Let's break this down. The tens digit in 401-409 is 0, so no 4 or 8 there. Then, 410-419: tens digit is 1, so no. 420-429: tens digit is 2, no. 430-439: tens digit is 3, no. 440-449: tens digit is 4, so here, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. 450-459: tens digit is 5, no. 460-469: tens digit is 6, no. 470-479: tens digit is 7, no. 480-488: tens digit is 8, so here, 8 appears 9 times because 480-488 is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 pages because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in this range.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (from 440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (from 480-488). So, total in tens place: 4's = 40 (from first 400) +10=50, 8's=40 (from first 400) +9=49.\n\nWait, but wait, in the first 400 pages, each hundred block contributes 10 times each digit in the tens place. So, for 4's in the tens place: 4 blocks *10=40, and 8's similarly 40. Then, in 401-488, as we saw, 440-449 adds 10 more 4's, and 480-488 adds 9 more 8's. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50, 8's:40 +9=49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (488 -400 +1=89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place:89, 8's:0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from total 4's:188 -98=90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place:\n- 488 pages, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in units. So, 48 each.\n- Then, from 481-488, units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units:48+1=49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- First 400 pages:4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 times 4 and 10 times 8 in tens place. So, 40 each.\n- Then, 401-488:\n  - 440-449: tens digit 4, 10 pages, so +10 4's.\n  - 480-488: tens digit 8, 9 pages, so +9 8's.\nSo, 4's:40+10=50, 8's:40+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488: hundreds digit 4, 89 pages, so 89 4's.\n- 8's: none, since the book ends at 488. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n- 488 pages / 10 = 48 full cycles, contributing 48 4's and 48 8's.\n- Pages 481-488 add one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488).\n- Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n- Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n- 400 pages contribute 40 4's and 40 8's.\n- Pages 401-488:\n  - 440-449 adds 10 4's.\n  - 480-488 adds 9 8's.\n- Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n- Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- Pages 400-488 have 4 as the hundreds digit, contributing 89 4's.\n- 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n- Total 4's: 89\n- Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

I'll handle each place for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's:\n\n1. **Units place**: The digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, in every set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, we'll take the integer part, which is 48 full sets. Each set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, the last partial set from 481 to 488 also includes 484, which is another 4 in the units place. So that's 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place**: Now, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers.

From 0 to 488, we have 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 488-399=89 pages in the next hundred. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds go up to 400-499, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last hundred is 400-488. So, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? In each full hundred, it's 10 times. There are 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10 times. Wait, no, 440-449 is part of the 400-499 hundred, but since we're only going up to 488, 440-449 is fully included. So, total tens place 4's are 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50 times.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is actually 89 pages, so the tens digit cycles every 10. So, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So total tens place 4's: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 times.\n\nWait, but actually, each number from 400 to 488 has 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus one more in 484, so 49. Tens place: 4 full hundreds (0-399) each contributing 10, so 40, plus 10 in 400-488, so 50. Hundreds place: 89 numbers from 400-488, so 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems right.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's:\n\n1. **Units place**: Similar to 4's, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, in 488 pages, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. But wait, the last number is 488, which ends with an 8, so that's another one. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place**: The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Now, how many full sets of 100 are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times each. So, 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred, 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we stop at 488, it's 9 numbers. So, that's 9 more. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 0-99, the tens digit 8 is 80-89, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, 100-199: 180-189, another 10. 200-299: 280-289, 10. 300-399: 380-389, 10. Now, 400-488: the tens digit 8 would be 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, 4 full sets of 10, and one partial set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place 8's: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 0-399, each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 8, so 4 hundreds *10=40. Then, 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 40+9=49. Units place: 48 full sets (480) plus the last one in 488, so 49. So, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. And for 4's in the tens place, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. Units place for 4's: 48 full sets (480) plus one more in 484, so 49. So, 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 48 full sets (480) plus one in 488, so 49. Tens place: 40 from the first four hundreds, plus 9 from 480-488, so 49. So, 49+49=98.\n\nThus, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers contribute one '4'. There are 48 full sets (1-480) and one more in 484, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** In each hundred, '4' appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). With 4 full hundreds (1-399) contributing 40, and 440-449 in 400-488 adding 10, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, there are 89 numbers with '4' in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** Every 10 numbers contribute one '8'. With 48 full sets (1-480) and one in 488, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** In each hundred, '8' appears 10 times. With 4 full hundreds contributing 40, and 480-488 adding 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No '8's since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the number of '8's from '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the best way to approach this is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) separately and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have the total counts for both digits, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So from 1 to 10, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. But wait, that's only for the units place. I need to check how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488 pages.\n\nTo find the number of complete tens, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives me 48 with a remainder of 8. So there are 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So for the units place, the count for 4's is 48, and the same for 8's.\n\nBut wait, the remainder is 8, so the last partial set is from 481 to 488. In the units place, how many 4's and 8's are there? Let's list them: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So in this partial set, there's one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). Therefore, for the units place, the total 4's are 48 + 1 = 49, and the 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. So in the units place, both digits appear the same number of times.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8.\n\nSince the book has 488 pages, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So for each of these 4 hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and the same for 8. So that's 4 * 10 = 40 for 4's and 40 for 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, what about the partial hundred from 401-488? Let's look at the tens digits here. The numbers 401-409 have a tens digit of 0, 410-419 have a tens digit of 1, and so on up to 480-488, which have a tens digit of 8. Wait, but the tens digit in 480-488 is 8, right? So in this partial hundred, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see: the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times. So for 4's in the tens place, we have an additional 10. For 8's, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So that's 9 times. Therefore, in the tens place, 4's have 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's have 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-409) to 8 (480-488). So the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. For 8's, it's in 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is included. So yes, 9 times. So total for tens place: 4's = 40 +10=50, 8's=40+9=49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, 4 for 400-488. So the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). So the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so 89 times. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4, not 8. So for the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times, and 8's appear 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences for each digit.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each place again.\n\nUnits place: For 4's, 48 full tens plus 1 in the last partial set, total 49. Same for 8's, so correct.\n\nTens place: For 4's, 4 full hundreds (each contributing 10) so 40, plus 10 in the partial hundred (440-449), total 50. For 8's, 4 full hundreds (40) plus 9 in the partial hundred (480-488), total 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4's appear 89 times (400-488), 8's appear 0 times. Correct.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, but wait, let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. That's correct. And the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So 9 times. So 40 +10=50 for 4's, 40 +9=49 for 8's.\n\nUnits place: Each full ten contributes one 4 and one 8. 48 full tens, so 48 each. Then the last 8 pages (481-488) have one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So 48 +1=49 each. Correct.\n\nSo yes, the total counts seem correct. Therefore, the difference is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each 10 pages contribute one 4 and one 8.\n   - 48 complete sets of 10 pages: 48 each.\n   - Last 8 pages (481-488): one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each 100 pages contribute 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - 4 complete hundreds: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 each.\n   - Last 88 pages (401-488):\n     - 4's: 10 times (440-449).\n     - 8's: 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4's appear in 400-488: 89 times.\n   - 8's do not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89.\n   - Total 8's: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the different positions where a digit can appear: the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place. I'll handle each digit separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** The digits cycle every 10 numbers, so in every set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on. So, I can calculate how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488 and then multiply by 1. \n\n   Wait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. So, the number of 4's in the units place would be 48 * 1 = 48. But wait, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit 4 appears only once, which is 484. So, actually, it's 48 + 1 = 49? Wait no, because 488 is the last page, so from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So 484 is within that range, so yes, that's an extra 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each set of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many complete sets of 100 are there in 488? That's 4 (since 4*100=400) and then 88 more. So, in each 100, we have 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial set (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, but wait, that's part of the 400s. Wait, no, 401-488 would have the tens digit as 0-8, but the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449. So, that's another 10 4's. So, total tens place 4's are 4*10 + 10 = 50? Wait, no, because 488 is less than 500, so the last 100 numbers (401-500) would have 10 4's in the tens place, but since we only go up to 488, does that affect it? Wait, 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, yes, total tens place 4's are 4*10 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 4*100 is 400, so up to 400, we have 4 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 40. Then from 401-488, we have another 10 in 440-449, so total 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the units place. Let's recalculate:\n\nUnits place: For every 10 numbers, there's one 4. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So total units 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Every 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each 100, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. How many full hundreds are there in 488? 4 (since 4*100=400). So, 4*10=40. Now, in the last 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 0-8. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens 4's: 40 + 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's. Each 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So, 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once (488). So, total units 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** In each 100 numbers, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Now, in the last 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times. So, total tens 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such numbers are there between 1 and 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, in the last partial set from 481 to 488, there's a 484, which is another 4 in the units place. So, that would be 49 times in the units place. \n\nWait, no, actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but the number of times the units digit is 4 is actually the integer division of 488 by 10, which is 48, plus 1 if the last number is 484, which is less than 488. Since 484 is indeed less than 488, we add 1, making it 49 times in the units place. \n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48 groups with a remainder of 8. So, in each group of 10, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, 48 groups would give 48 fours. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 is included once (484). So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49. \n\nOkay, so units place contributes 49 fours. Now, moving on to the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place. \n\nSo, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: from 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in 1-100, 40-49: that's one block. In 101-200, 140-149: another block. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many blocks is that? Let's count: 40-49 (1), 140-149 (2), 240-249 (3), 340-349 (4), 440-449 (5). So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. That would be 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. \n\nWait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. \n\nNow, what about the hundreds place? The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. \n\nWait, but wait, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. \n\nSo, adding up all the fours: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of fours is 188. \n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4, so each of those 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. \n\nNow, moving on to the number of 8's. I'll do the same process. \n\nStarting with the units place: for every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? \n\n488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (488). So, units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. \n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), so that's a partial block. \n\nEach full block (like 80-89, etc.) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many full blocks are there? From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in the blocks 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four full blocks, each contributing 10 eights. So, 4 * 10 = 40 eights in the tens place. \n\nNow, the partial block from 480-488: the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, so how many are there? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 eights in the tens place. \n\nSo, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. \n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. \n\nSo, total eights: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. \n\nWait, so the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. \n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFirst, checking the fours:\n\n- Units place: 49. Correct, because 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, plus one more in the last partial group (484), so 49.\n\n- Tens place: 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Each block is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, checking the eights:\n\n- Units place: 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, plus one more in 488, so 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: four full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 eights, so 40. Plus the partial block 480-488, which has 9 eights in the tens place. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0. Correct.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 = 98. \n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. \n\nWait, but I feel like that might be an overcount. Let me think again. Maybe I'm counting some numbers twice or missing something. \n\nWait, in the tens place for fours, I included 440-449, which is correct because 449 is less than 488. So, that's fine. \n\nIn the units place for fours, 484 is included, which is correct. \n\nIn the tens place for eights, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. That's correct. \n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the number of fours is 188, the number of eights is 98, so the difference is 90. \n\nWait, but let me think again: 488 is the last page. So, in the hundreds place for fours, 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. \n\nIn the hundreds place for eights, 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are no eights in the hundreds place. \n\nSo, yes, the counts seem correct. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of '4's:**\n   - **Units Place:** For every 10 numbers, '4' appears once in the units place. There are 48 full groups of 10 in 488, contributing 48 '4's. The last partial group (481-488) includes 484, adding 1 more. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** '4' appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 '4's. Total: 5\u00d710=50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** '4' appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of '8's:**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to '4's, '8' appears once every 10 numbers. 48 full groups contribute 48 '8's, and 488 adds 1 more. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** '8' appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full blocks contributing 40 '8's. The partial block 480-488 adds 9 '8's. Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No '8's since the book ends at 488. Total: 0.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " That means the highest page number is a three-digit number, 488.\n\nI guess I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have the counts for both digits, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every group of ten pages (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place, and the same goes for the digit 8. \n\nNow, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of ten and an extra 8 pages (481-488). In each of the 48 complete groups, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So that's 48 times each. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial group, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, for the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's, which is also 49. So, in the units place, they are equal.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit changes every ten pages. So, for example, in the range 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (like 40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (like 80-89). \n\nSince the book has 488 pages, which is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each of the 4 hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4*10=40 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times in each hundred, so that's also 4*10=40 times.\n\nNow, let's look at the last partial hundred, 401-488. The tens digit here cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, in this range, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Well, the tens digit 4 would be in 440-449, but wait, the last page is 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488. So that's 10 pages where the tens digit is 4. Similarly, the tens digit 8 would be in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times in this last partial hundred.\n\nSo, adding that up, for the tens place, the total number of 4's is 4*10 + 10 = 50, and the number of 8's is 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, in the tens place, there are 50 4's and 49 8's. That means there's one more 4 in the tens place than 8's.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, each full hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and the tens digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So yes, 4*10=40 plus 10 gives 50 for 4's, and 4*10=40 plus 9 gives 49 for 8's. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. So, in the range 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0. From 100 onwards, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4, since the book goes up to 488.\n\nSo, let's see how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for page numbers 400-488. So, that's 89 pages (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, how about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in the book, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, the count for 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let me summarize the counts for each digit:\n\n- Units place:\n  - 4's: 49\n  - 8's: 49\n\n- Tens place:\n  - 4's: 50\n  - 8's: 49\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4's: 89\n  - 8's: 0\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nStarting with the units place: 488 pages. For each 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens and 8 extra pages. So, 48*1=48 for each digit, plus in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48+1=49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens digit. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). So, 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, 4 appears in the tens place from 440-449, which is 10 times. 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 times. So, total for tens place: 40+10=50 for 4's, and 40+9=49 for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so 0. That seems correct.\n\nAdding up: 4's total is 49+50+89=188. 8's total is 49+49+0=98. The difference is 188-98=90. Hmm, so that seems to be correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, right? Because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 pages, so 89 times. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to check: Let me calculate the total number of digits printed. Each page number is printed once, so for pages 1-9, there are 9 single-digit numbers, each with 1 digit. Pages 10-99: 90 two-digit numbers, each with 2 digits, so 180 digits. Pages 100-488: 488 - 100 + 1 = 389 pages, each with 3 digits, so 389*3=1167 digits. So total digits: 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 4's and 8's. 4's: 188, 8's: 98. So, total digits accounted for by 4's and 8's: 188 + 98 = 286. So, the remaining digits would be other numbers. But maybe that's not necessary for this problem. But just to make sure, 286 is less than 1356, so it's plausible.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the tens place. Let me recount the tens digit for the last partial hundred (401-488). The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit, how many times does it appear? From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but since we stop at 488, it's 481-488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear? For 0: 10 pages (401-410), but wait, 401-410 is 10 pages, right? So, the tens digit 0 appears 10 times. Similarly, for tens digits 1 to 7, each appears 10 times. For tens digit 8, it's from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times.\n\nWait, but I'm considering the tens digit in the last partial hundred (401-488). So, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? It's from 440-449, which is 10 pages. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, yes, that's correct. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times in this range.\n\nSo, adding up, in the tens place, 4 appears 4*10 + 10 = 50 times, and 8 appears 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. That's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: For the tens digit, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times. So, in 4 full hundreds, that's 40 each. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? From 440-449, which is 10 times. How about 8? From 480-488, which is 9 times. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my initial calculation is correct. The total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me just think about the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times the hundreds digit is 4. So, that's 89 4's. Correct.\n\nSo, in summary:\n\n- Units place: 49 4's, 49 8's\n- Tens place: 50 4's, 49 8's\n- Hundreds place: 89 4's, 0 8's\n\nAdding them up:\n\n4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the units place. Let me recount.\n\nUnits place: For each 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, 488 pages would have 48 full tens, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8, so 48 each. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total 4's: 48 +1=49, and same for 8's. That's correct.\n\nAnother way: The number of times a digit appears in the units place can be calculated as floor(488/10) = 48, and then if the last digit is >= the target digit, add 1. So, for 4: floor(488/10)=48, and since 8 >=4, add 1, total 49. Similarly for 8: floor(488/10)=48, and since 8 >=8, add 1, total 49. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place: The number of times a digit d appears in the tens place up to n is calculated as follows. Let me think. For each hundred, the digit d appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 488, which is less than 500, we have 4 full hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10 times for each digit in the tens place. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), we need to see how many times the tens digit is 4 and 8.\n\nWait, but I think my earlier approach was correct.\n\nSo, I think my initial answer is correct. The difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each group of ten pages (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) has one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full groups of ten in 480 pages, contributing 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) add one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488).\n   - **Total:** 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contains ten instances of each digit in the tens place.\n   - Four full hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - The last partial hundred (401-488) has the tens digit 4 appearing 10 times (440-449) and 8 appearing 9 times (480-488).\n   - **Total:** 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n   - The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total:** 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\n**Summing Up:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
