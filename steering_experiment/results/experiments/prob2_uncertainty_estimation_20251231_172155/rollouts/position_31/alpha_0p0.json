    "text": " Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me check: 400 to 488 is indeed 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Hmm, wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Wait, when I calculated the units place, I thought it was 49 fours, but let me recount. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms can be calculated as (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So that's correct. For the tens place, from 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, so 5*10=50 fours. For the hundreds place, 400-488: that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49+50+89= 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count each set. 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480 is the first, then 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So that's 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) plus 9, which is 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 numbers, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

I'll go through each digit position again. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take the integer part, 48, but wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but since the book goes up to 488, that's 480-488. So, how many sets do we have? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.

Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. Hundreds place: none. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.

But let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, how many? The formula is (last - first)/step +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1 =48 +1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets: 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. Correct. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Now for eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. Last term is 488, which is 8 mod 10. So, (488 -8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms (since (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers for the first four blocks, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 numbers.\n   - Total = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, I need to do the same for the digit 8. Let me go through each place again. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, but wait: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? From 8 to 488 with a common difference of 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, that's 49 + 49 = 98. But let me double-check: units place is 49, tens place is 49, so 98 total eights. Now, the number of fours is 188 and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with fours: units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct. For eights: units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds: 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer would be 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me check the tens place for eights again. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, and the last block (480-488) has 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That's correct. Similarly, for fours in the hundreds place: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, correct. So, yes, the calculation seems right. Therefore, the number of fours printed is 90 more than the number of eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Now, adding up the fours from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 49 numbers, so 49 fours in the units place. Tens place: each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 4, so from 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Since 440-449 is within 488, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Hundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many full sets we have. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except the last block, which only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (4, 14, 24, ..., 484):**\n   - These occur every 10 numbers.\n   - The sequence starts at 4 and ends at 484.\n   - Number of 4's: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449):**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Number of 4's: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place (400-488):**\n   - All numbers from 400 to 488 have a 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Number of 4's: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (8, 18, 28, ..., 488):**\n   - These occur every 10 numbers.\n   - The sequence starts at 8 and ends at 488.\n   - Number of 8's: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488):**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - However, the last block (480-488) contributes only 9 numbers.\n   - Number of 8's: 4 * 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - There are no page numbers from 800-899, so no 8's here.\n   - Number of 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Again, I'll go through each digit position. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many 8's are in the units place? The first is 8, the next is 18, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms can be found by (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be another set, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, right? 480, 481, ..., 488: that's 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 = 9). Wait, no, that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8, so each of these 9 numbers has an 8 in the tens place. So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 10 each, so 4*10=40. The last set, 480-488, contributes 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many numbers have 8 in the tens place. Each full hundred has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except possibly the last one. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that right? Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, yes, 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90.

Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but including 488, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also count? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, how many sets do we have? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9. So, total in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 from 480-488, so 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So that's 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, number of 4's is 188, and number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For the 4's: units place: from 4,14,...484. Let's see: 484 is 484, which is 48*10 +4, so that's 49 numbers, correct. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets of 10, so 50, correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. So 49+50+89=188, correct. For the 8's: units place: 8,18,...488. 488 is the 49th number, correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49, correct. Hundreds place: 0, correct. So total eights:49+49=98. So the difference is 188-98=90.

So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98.

I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each hundred block has 10 eights in the tens place except the last one. Let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " Now, adding up all the fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first is 8, and the last is 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48. But wait, 488 is included, so it's actually 49 times. Wait, let me check: 8, 18, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 count? But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks we have. From 1-400: there are 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488). So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me think again. Actually, each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, up to 400, that's 4 blocks, each giving 10, so 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me check the tens place for eights again. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, that's correct. And in each hundred block before that, it's 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 blocks give 40. So, total 49 in tens place. Units place: 49, so total eights 98. Fours: 188. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8. So, how many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, how many are there? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but 480-489 would normally be 10 numbers, but here we only go up to 488, so it's 9 numbers. So, let's count each block: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total 8's printed: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the 4's in the units place. From 4,14,...,484. The last number is 484, which is 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. That seems correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. 49+50+89=188, correct. Now for 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, +1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So total 8's:49+49=98. So 188-98=90. Wait, but wait a minute, I think I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. So, 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. For 8's, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0, total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. The last block is 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9. So, 9 numbers. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, yes, 98 eights.

Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Each full set (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no hundreds digits that are 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when counting the tens place for eights, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. That's correct. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in the hundreds place, I might have made a mistake. Let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. And for eights, no hundreds digits are 8, so that's 0. So, yes, 188 fours and 98 eights. The difference is 90.

Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many times that is. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see if 480-489 is within the book's pages. The book ends at 488, so 480-488 is included. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9. So, that's 5 blocks, but the last one only has 9. So total eights in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 4*10=40, plus the 480-488 which contributes 9, so total 49 eights in tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188 and the number of eights is 98.

Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part gives 48, but wait, 488 is included, so it's actually 49 occurrences. Let me check: 8, 18, ..., 488. Yes, that's 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 480-489 would be beyond 488, so 380-389 is the last set. Let's count: each set is 10 numbers. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, so 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 380-389 is within 488, right? Yes, 389 is less than 488, so that's correct. So, 40 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 89 eights. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 89 eights = 99. Wait, that can't be right because when I did the units place for fours, I thought it was 49, but let me double-check. Wait, when I calculated the units place for fours, I considered 4,14,...,484, which is 49 numbers, correct. Tens place for fours: 40-49,140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For eights, units: 8,18,...,488: 49 eights. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389: 4 sets of 10, so 40 eights. So total eights: 49 + 40 = 89. So 188 - 89 = 99. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because in the tens place for fours, I thought it's 5 sets (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449), which is 5*10=50. That seems correct. For eights in the tens place, 4 sets: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, which is 4*10=40. So, 40 eights in the tens place. So, 49 (units) + 40 (tens) = 89 eights total. So, 188 fours minus 89 eights is indeed 99. Wait, but wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the units place for fours. Let me list some numbers to check. Units place fours: 4,14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94,104,114,...,484. How many numbers is that? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10 each time. So, (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct. So, 49 fours in units place. Similarly, for eights in units place: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. So, the calculation seems right. Therefore, the number of fours is 188, and eights are 89. So, 188 - 89 = 99.

    "text": " Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. Hmm, but let me double-check. Wait, from 1-99, the number of 4's in units place is 9 (4,14,24,...,84), and in tens place is 10 (40-49). So up to 99, it's 19 fours. Then from 100-399, the hundreds digit isn't 4, but the tens and units can be. For the tens place, each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so that's 3 sets of 10, which is 30. Similarly, the units digit in each hundred block has 10 fours, so that's another 30. So from 100-399, it's 30 (tens) + 30 (units) = 60 fours. Then from 400-488, we have 89 numbers with 4 in the hundreds place, and in the tens and units places, how many? Let's see: from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, and the units digit is 4 in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one, but wait, 400-488 includes 484, so that's 9 occurrences (since 404 is the first, then every 10 after that up to 484, which is 9 numbers: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484). Wait, that's 9 numbers, but actually, from 400-488, the units digit is 4 every 10 numbers starting at 404, so how many? Let's calculate: (484 - 404)/10 + 1 = (80)/10 +1=8+1=9. So units place in 400-488: 9 fours. Tens place in 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, in 400-488, the number of fours is 89 (hundreds) + 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 108. So total fours up to 488 would be: from 1-99:19, from 100-399:60, and from 400-488:108. Adding those together:19+60=79, plus 108 is 187. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 188. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe it's better to count each digit place separately across the entire range 1-488. Let's try that. For the units place: how many times does 4 appear in the units digit from 1-488? Well, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so the number of times 4 appears is total numbers divided by 10, rounded down, plus one if the last number is >= the digit. So 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, check if the last partial cycle (480-488) includes a 4 in the units place. 484 is within that range, so that's one more. So total units place fours:48 +1=49. For the tens place: similarly, every 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So in each block of 100, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So total number of tens place fours is (number of hundreds) *10. Since 488 is less than 500, we have 4 full hundreds (1-100,101-200,201-300,301-400), and then 401-488. Each of the first four hundreds contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total tens place fours:40 +10=50. For the hundreds place: the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1=89. So hundreds place fours:89. Now, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89)=49+50=99+89=188. Wait, so earlier when I thought it was 187, I must have miscalculated. So total fours:188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units digit from 1-488? Same method: 488/10=48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then check if the last partial cycle (480-488) includes an 8 in the units place: 488 is the last number, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So total units place eights:48 +1=49. 2. **Tens place:** Every 100 numbers, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So for each full hundred, 10 eights in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100,101-200,201-300,301-400), so 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers:480,481,...,488. So the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So total tens place eights:40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So hundreds place eights:0. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's)=90. Wait, but earlier I thought the number of 4's was 188 and 8's was 98, so the difference is 90. But let me double-check the counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the number of 8's. Units place: from 1-488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place, so 48 full cycles (1-480) give 48 eights, and then 488 is the 49th. So units:49. Tens place: in each hundred, 10 eights (e.g., 80-89). There are 4 full hundreds, so 4*10=40. Then in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So tens:40+9=49. Hundreds place:0. So total eights:49+49=98. Number of 4's:188. So 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

I'll do the same for the units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. So, (n-1)*10 \u2264 480 \u2192 n-1 \u2264 48 \u2192 n \u2264 49.

Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, starting at 8, each 10 numbers up to 488. So, from 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? The first term is 8, which is 8 = 8 + 10*(n-1). So, 488 = 8 + 10*(n-1). 488 - 8 = 10*(n-1). 480 = 10*(n-1). So, n-1 = 48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the book, but 489 and 490 are beyond 488, so we only go up to 488. Let me count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are.

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Each of these blocks (except maybe the last one) has 10 numbers.

So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

    "text": " Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's indeed 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but we also have the 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So units place is 49. Tens place: in each hundred, 10 numbers have 4 in the tens place. There are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens places with 4: 4 sets of 10 (from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349) and one set from 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many terms? (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let me count how many sets there are. Each hundred has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). Now, 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, how many eights? Each of the first four hundreds contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. So, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188.

So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, is that correct? Let me think: 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, each hundred block except the last one contributes 10 eights, and the last one contributes 9. So, how many hundreds blocks are there? From 1-488, we have four hundreds: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, that's five blocks, but the last one is only up to 488. So, the first four blocks (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each have a full set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. The last block, 400-488, has 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total eights in tens place: 4 blocks * 10 + 1 block * 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is in 1-99, 180-189 in 100-199, 280-289 in 200-299, 380-389 in 300-399, and 480-488 in 400-488. So, that's 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 188. For eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. That seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n1. **Counting the number of '4's:**\n   - **Units place:** '4' appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is 488, so from 8 to 488, how many 8's in the units place? Let me think: starting at 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms can be calculated as (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place.

So, total eights in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, which is 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 49 is 98, but let me double-check. Units:49, tens:49, so total 98 eights.

So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included.

Wait, no, actually, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, the tens place 8's are in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9).

    "text": " Now, adding them all up: Units:49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total fours = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. Let me count how many terms that is. The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last term - first term)/common difference) +1. So, (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So units place is 49, correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10, and there are 5 hundreds (0-4), so 5*10=50. But wait, does the hundreds digit go up to 4? Wait, no, the hundreds digit in the tens place is for the tens digit being 4, regardless of the hundreds digit. So from 0-99, 40-49:10, 100-199:140-149:10, 200-299:240-249:10, 300-399:340-349:10, 400-488:440-449:10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours:49+50+89=188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is the 49th term because 488/10=48.8, so 49 terms. So units place:49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, and the last set (480-488) has 9 numbers. So total tens place: 4*10 +9=49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So hundreds place:0 eights. Now, adding them up: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total eights=49+49=98. Wait, let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So total eights:49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. Wait, that's 90 more fours. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89, total=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0, total=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. But wait, let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. And for the tens place, 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Units place:49 fours. So 49+50+89=188. For eights, units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. So 98 eights. So difference is 188-98=90.

Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours in the tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is included. Let's find how many such numbers. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many tens digits are 8. Each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers? Let me check: 480 is the first, then 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers, right? Wait, no, from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9. So, for the 480-489 range, only up to 488, so 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 in 10 numbers for each hundred except the last one, which has 9. So, that's 4 hundreds blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, and the 480-488 contributing 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, let me check again. Units: 49, Tens: 49, so total 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each hundred block contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total: 5 sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449) \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each hundred block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last set (480-488) which has 9.\n   - Total: 4 sets \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
