    "text": " Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of fours is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but the book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the 9th number after 480 (480 is the first, 481 second, ..., 488 ninth). So, that's 5 blocks, but the last block only has 9. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Therefore, total eights are units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

    "text": " So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many. The last occurrence is 488, which is 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds another 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's see how many full sets we have. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, not 10). So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems right. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences (since pages go up to 488).\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but actually, when considering the hundreds place, only the numbers where the hundreds digit is 4. So, from 400 to 488, that's correct, 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the tens place for 8? Let me think. In the tens place, the digits are 80-89, which is 10 numbers, then 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488. So, for 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, contributing 10 eights each, and the last set (480-488) has 9 numbers, contributing 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, no, wait: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So that's 10 + 10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights: 98. Wait, but earlier I thought units place was 49 and tens was 49, so total 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) +1. So, (488-4)=484, 484/10=48.4, floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. That's correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in hundreds place. So, 89. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. How many? The last number is 488, which is 8 in units place. So, (488-8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Hundreds place: none, as 800-899 is beyond 488. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " Wait, let me check: 400 is the first, 401, 402,... up to 488. So, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of fours is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many such numbers are there? Let's see, starting from 8, each step of 10. So, 8, 18, 28,..., 488. To find how many terms there are, we can consider the sequence: 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. Solving for n: 10*(n-1) = 480 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's see how many complete sets we have. Each 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total number of eights is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. Wait, no: 8, 18, ..., 488. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49.

But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nSo, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9.

So, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights.\n\nWait, let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total eights are 49+49=98.\n\nWait, but earlier for fours, I had 188. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for fours:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:98.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for fours again. I had 5 sets of 10: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. That's correct.\n\nFor eights in the tens place, I had 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49. That's correct.\n\nUnits place for fours: from 4,14,...,484. How many? The formula is ((484 -4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nUnits place for eights: from 8,18,...,488. ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for fours: 400-488. 488-400+1=89. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for eights: none, since 800>488. Correct.\n\nSo, total fours:188, total eights:98. Difference:90.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the tens place for fours, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. But when counting eights, 480-488 is correct as 9 numbers.

    "text": " Wait, but let me think: 400 is the first, then 401, 402,... up to 488. So yes, 89 numbers. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. Wait, but wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but let me double-check the hundreds place. From 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many? Let me list them: 4,14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94,104,...,484. Each set of 10 has one, so from 1 to 488, how many sets of 10? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place, which would be 48, but wait, 484 is the last one, which is the 49th occurrence because 484 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 4. So, units place: 49. Tens place: 10 per hundred, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only up to 449, right? Because 450-488 would have tens digits 5,6,7,8,9. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, the tens place in 400-488 is 10 fours, same as in other hundreds. So, total tens place fours: 5 sets of 10, so 50. Units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. So total 4's: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence, because 488 is 48*10 +8, so 48 full sets plus one more, making 49. So, units place:49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. So, how many sets? Each block from 0-99, 100-199, etc., has one block where the tens digit is 8. So, 0-99:80-89:10 numbers, 100-199:180-189:10, 200-299:280-289:10, 300-399:380-389:10, and 400-488:480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, how many 8's? 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to miscount. For the 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For the 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that makes sense. Let me see if there's another way to approach this, maybe by considering each digit position separately and using a formula. For the units place, the number of times a digit d appears is floor(n/10) + (1 if the remainder is >= d else 0), but I think I did it correctly by counting each occurrence. Similarly for the tens and hundreds places, I considered how many full blocks and the partial block. Yeah, I think 90 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Total occurrences: 49 (from 4 to 484, inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).  \n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.  \n   - Total numbers: 89 (from 400 to 488, inclusive).  \n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Total occurrences: 49 (from 8 to 488, inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences except the last one (480-488), which contributes 9.  \n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, let me double-check: 400 is the first, 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8 can appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many numbers in each set. Each full set (like 80-89) has 10 numbers. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10, which is 40, plus 9, totaling 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct. For the 8's: units:49, tens:49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm wondering if I counted correctly in the tens place for 8's. Let me recount the tens place for 8's. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers, so that's 4*10=40. The last set, 480-488, is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. That's correct. So, 49 in units and 49 in tens, totaling 98. So, the difference is indeed 90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for 4's would be 89, but let me confirm: from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, that's correct. So, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's are 98, so the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences (5 blocks of 10).\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences (488 - 400 + 1).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488.\n   - Each full block contributes 10 occurrences, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences (40 from full blocks + 9 from 480-488).\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- More 4's than 8's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me check: 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, yes, because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last set is 380-389. Let me count how many sets: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. So that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. Wait, but does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? Yes, but 488 is within 480-489. So, 480-489 is another set where the tens digit is 8, but the book ends at 488. So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Wait, so that's an additional 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, so I think I need to include that. So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me check the tens place for eights again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9.

    "text": " Wait, no, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers.

So, that's 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, no: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8.

So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my counting to make sure I didn't miss anything.

Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is included, so that's 49. Tens place: 80-89,180-189, etc., up to 480-488. Each block is 10 except the last, which is 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. I think that's correct.

So, total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many sets of 100 we have. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 10 each, totaling 40. The last block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, let me check: 400 is the first, 401, 402,... up to 488. So yes, 89 numbers. So total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 +89= 188. Hmm, so 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28,... up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last, so 480-488 is 9 numbers). Wait, is that correct? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So that's 9. So total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that can't be right because when I subtract 98 from 188, I get 90. But let me double-check my counts because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recount the 4's in the hundreds place: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, correct. Tens place: 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours, correct. Units place: 49 fours, correct. So 49+50+89=188, that's correct. For the 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, so 98. So 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place for 8's, I had 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. So that's correct. So the difference is 90. Wait, but I feel like that might be off because sometimes when counting, especially in the higher numbers, you might have overlaps or miscalculations. Let me try another approach to verify. Alternatively, I can consider each digit position separately and count the number of 4's and 8's in each position.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: For every 10 numbers, there's one 4. So from 1 to 488, how many full tens are there? 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. But wait, the first 4 is at 4, which is within the first 10 numbers, so actually, it's 49 fours in the units place because 488 is included. So units:49.\n\n- Tens place: For every 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So in each 100 numbers, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So how many hundreds are there? 488 is in the 400-488 range, which is less than 500. So, the number of times the tens digit is 4 is:\n\n- From 0-99: 40-49:10\n- 100-199:140-149:10\n- 200-299:240-249:10\n- 300-399:340-349:10\n- 400-488:440-449:10 (since 440-449 is within 488)\nWait, that's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488: that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: Similarly, every 10 numbers, one 8. From 1-488, that's 48 full tens, but 488 is included, so 49 eights.\n\n- Tens place: For every 100 numbers, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89). So:\n\n- 0-99:80-89:10\n- 100-199:180-189:10\n- 200-299:280-289:10\n- 300-399:380-389:10\n- 400-488:480-488:9 (since 488 is the last)\nSo that's 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, totaling 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n- Hundreds place: No 8's because the book ends at 488, so no 800-899.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for 4's would have more, but no, 89 is correct because 400-488 is 89 numbers.\n\nWait, another way to check: Let me think about how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor units place:\n\n- 4's: From 1-488, the number of times 4 appears in units is floor(488/10) + (if 488 mod 10 >=4, add 1). So floor(488/10)=48, and 488 mod10=8, which is >=4, so 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly for 8's: floor(488/10)=48, and 488 mod10=8, so 48+1=49.\n\nFor tens place:\n\n- 4's: For each hundred, 10 times. So 488/100=4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (440-449). So total 40+10=50.\n\n- 8's: Similarly, for each hundred, 10 times. So 4 full hundreds, 4*10=40. In the last partial hundred, 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers (480-488). So total 40+9=49.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\n- 4's: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\n- 8's: From 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, 0.\n\nSo total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers.

So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check again. Units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems high. Let me see if I made a mistake. Wait, from 1-99, the number of fours in the units place is 9 (4,14,24,...,84), which is 9. But I thought earlier it was 49. Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I made a mistake in the units place. Let me recalculate. For units place: The first 4 is at 4, then every 10 numbers after that. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see: The number of times is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488), which includes 484 as the 49th occurrence. So, 49 fours in the units place. Similarly, in the tens place: For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 1-488, how many hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49 in that hundred, but wait, 400-488: the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 more. So total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50. So that's correct. Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8, and then the extra 8 in 488. So, 48 +1 = 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** For each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no: 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many full sets of 10 are there? From 1-400: 400/100=4, so 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Wait, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For the eights, in the tens place, I had 49, which seems correct because from 1-400, 4 sets of 10, so 40, and then 480-488 is 9, so 49 total. Units place: 49 eights, correct. So, total eights: 49+49=98. Fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct.

So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**\n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389).\n   - The last block is 480-488, contributing 9 occurrences.\n   - Total occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**\n49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, actually, no. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 499, but our book only goes up to 488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is 488, which is the 49th number because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last, so 480-488 is 9 numbers). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

Hmm, but I thought maybe I made a mistake because when I think about hundreds place, it's from 400 to 488, which is indeed 89 numbers. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which would give 48 eights. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one more. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-489. But since we only go up to 488, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and then 9 from 480-488. So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's are 188, total 8's are 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, when counting the units place for 4's, I thought it was 49, but let me recount that. From 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. How many terms are there? The formula is (last term - first term) / common difference + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So that's correct.\n\nFor the tens place of 4's, it's 10 per hundred, and there are 5 hundreds (40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nFor hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89. So total 4's: 49+50+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 8,18,...,488. Let's see, 488 is the last one. So, (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 0. So total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, that seems correct.

So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188 fours. Hmm, wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484. So from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5*10=50. Correct.

Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488).

So yes, 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me double-check my counting for eights in the tens place. I had 480-488 as 9 numbers, but 480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488: that's 9 numbers. So, yes, 480-488 is 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, total eights=49+49=98. Fours=188. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: \\( \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, totaling \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: \\( \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last contributes 9, totaling \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers from 800-899 exist, so 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:** \\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but I should check if the hundreds digit is only 4, so from 400-488, yes, the hundreds digit is 4. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. How many? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last set. Each set except the last one has 10 numbers. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So total eights in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, checking the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's from 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, so 89. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. Number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, total 49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: None, as 800-899 is beyond 488. So 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Hmm, that seems a bit high, but let me check again. Wait, when counting the hundreds place, from 400 to 488 is indeed 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units place: 49, tens:50, so total 49+50+89=188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,..., up to 488. The last occurrence is 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but including 488, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. Let me count how many blocks: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.

Wait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake with the ranges. For 4's in the hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. For units place, 4 appears 49 times, which is correct because from 1-488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place, and 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 times. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449: that's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place, 49 times. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,...,480-488. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40 plus 9 is 49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place.

The difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, when I counted the hundreds place for fours, I had 89 fours because from 400-488 is 89 numbers. But let me confirm: 488-400+1=89, yes.\n\nFor the tens place of fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place for fours: 4,14,...,484. How many? Let's see: 484 is the last one. So, starting at 4, every 10 numbers. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Yes, that's correct.\n\nFor eights:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,...,488. That's 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers.\n\nTens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9.

Because 400-488 is 89 numbers, but each of these contributes one 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: for the hundreds place, the digit is 4 only in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nSo, yes, total fours:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nEights:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for fours.

So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Hmm, but wait, let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. And for eights, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place for that set. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, that's correct. So, the total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.

So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but including 488, that's 49 occurrences. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

So total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

Now, let me check if I did that right. Wait, 49 in units, 50 in tens, 89 in hundreds. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is indeed 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. To count how many, we can take 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 8 appears in 8, 18, ..., 488. So that's 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many sets: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check. Units: 8,18,...,488: 49 times. Tens: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9, which adds up to 49. So, total eights: 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and eights are 98.

The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1=(480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in units. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.

Now, adding up the fours from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: from 4,14,...,484: that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10.

So, how many? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 =48 +1=49.

Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9=49. Correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place for eights, I included 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, 480-488 is 9, not 10. So, that part is correct. Similarly, for fours in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so that's correct. So, the difference is 90.

Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups, each contributing an 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we stop at 488, it's 9 numbers. So, the tens place in 480-488 gives 9 eights instead of 10. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, no, actually, 80-89 is in the first 100, 180-189 in the second, 280-289 in the third, and 380-389 in the fourth, and then 480-488 in the fifth. So that's 5 blocks, but the last block only has 9 numbers. So, 4 full blocks of 10, and one partial block of 9, so 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, let me check the tens place for fours again. I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours. Let me list them: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, so 50 fours in the tens place. That seems correct. For eights in the tens place, I had 4 full sets of 10 and one partial set of 9, totaling 49. That also seems correct. Units place for both digits had 49 each, which makes sense because from 1 to 488, each digit from 0-9 appears roughly the same number of times in the units place, except maybe the last digit if it doesn't complete the full set. But since 488 ends with 8, the units digit for 8 would have an extra count, but in this case, both 4 and 8 have 49 in the units place because 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th 8 in the units place. Wait, but 488 is page 488, so the units digit is 8, so that's correct. Similarly, for 4, the last occurrence in the units place is 484, which is the 49th occurrence because 484 is 48*10 +4, so yes, 49 times. Okay, so I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the difference is 188 fours minus 98 eights, which equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block contributes 10 occurrences. There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in numbers 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block (480-488) which has 9. Total: 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - More '4's than '8's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 only in 400-488, so that's 89 numbers. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484: 484 is 48*10 +4, so that's 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, so 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number is 488, so the units digit 8 occurs in 488. How many times? The first is 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. To find the count: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers? Wait, 488-480=8, but including both ends, it's 9 numbers. So, 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) = 40, plus 9 in 480-488, so total 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, hundreds place gives 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 ends with 88, so the last one is 488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first is 8, then every 10 numbers. The last one is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, no, wait: 8, 18, ..., 488. Let's see, 488 is the 49th term because (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each full set (like 80-89) has 10 numbers, and the last set (480-488) has 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). Let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

Hmm, but wait, does that make sense? Let me think again. Wait, when counting the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct. So total fours are 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8 is the units digit. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is included. So, how many sets do we have? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, total eights in the tens place are 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, let me double-check the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. That's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. So, total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours and eights separately. For fours: units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, step 10. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets. 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488. 488-400+1=89. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four is 10, last is 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yes, that seems correct.

The nth term is 10n - 6? Wait, no, better way: The number of 4's in units place is equal to the number of times 4 appears in the units digit from 1 to 488. So, for each 10 numbers, there's one 4 in the units place. So, total number of complete decades is 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the 49th decade, which is 480-488, the units digit 4 occurs once at 484. So, total units place 4's: 48 +1=49. That's correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. So, from 1-488, how many hundreds? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 40 +10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: Only in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The last occurrence is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10.

So, let's count: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last, so from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

    "text": " Wait, no, wait. Actually, the hundreds digit is 4 only in 400-499, but since the book ends at 488, it's 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The last number is 488, which is 48*10 + 8. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, does 480-489 have 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's are 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the tens place for eights again. I think I might have made a mistake there. When counting the tens place for eights, I considered 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. Let me recount: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. So, total eights are 98. So, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Total numbers: 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.  \n   - Each hundred contains 10 such numbers, and there are 5 hundreds (0-400).  \n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.  \n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Total numbers: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.  \n   - Each hundred contains 10 such numbers, and there are 5 hundreds (0-400).  \n   - The last range (480-488) has 9 numbers.  \n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers, except the last one, which has 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 eights in the tens place, that's 4*10=40. The last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (fours) -98 (eights)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake with inclusive ranges. For fours: units place: 4,14,...,484. From 0 to 484, every 10 numbers, so 484/10=48.4, but since we include both 4 and 484, it's 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49,140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So, 10*4=40 +9=49. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total eights:49+49=98. Difference:188-98=90.

So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So total is 10*4 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. I think I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for 4's. Let me check again. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct. For the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units place: 4,14,...484. That's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. So, 49 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, so 98. 188-98=90. Yeah, I think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This gives 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
