    "text": " So, total number of fours is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many times. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is within 488. Yes, 480-488 is part of the book. So, how many sets? From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So total eights in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total number of eights is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights.

But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Each block from 80-89, 180-189, etc., gives 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98 eights. Now, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) -98 (eights)=90.

Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let's do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to fours, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many that is.

Wait, 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers because 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 49 eights in the tens place.

So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place was 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check again, maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let's go through each digit place again for both digits. **Counting fours:**\n\n- **Units place:** From 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The sequence is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, n=49. Correct, 49 fours in units.\n\n- **Tens place:** 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each gives 10 fours. How many such blocks? From 40-49:1, 140-149:2, up to 440-449:5. So, 5 blocks, 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488: that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188.\n\n**Counting eights:**\n\n- **Units place:** 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 + 10*(n-1)=488. So, 10*(n-1)=480, n-1=48, n=49. Correct, 49 eights.\n\n- **Tens place:** 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct.\n\n- **Hundreds place:** None, since 800-899 is beyond 488.

The last occurrence is at 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but since the book only goes up to 488, 480-488 would be part of that. Let's see: Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 = 40 and +9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights printed. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me check my calculations again because 188 - 98 is 90, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. Let me double-check the tens place for 8's. The tens digit is 8 in numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488). So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 = 98. So, fours are 188, eights are 98. 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count any numbers. For example, in the hundreds place, I counted 89 fours, which is correct because from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. For the tens place, 50 fours, that's correct. Units place, 49 fours. So, 49 +50 +89=188. For eights, units place 49, tens place 49, so 98. So, 188-98=90.

I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds another 8 in the units place. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488: that's 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus the 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, we subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of '4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Yes, because 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last, so 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, right? Wait, no: 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers? Wait, 488 - 480 +1 =9? Wait, 480 is the first, 481 is the second, ..., 488 is the ninth. So, 9 numbers. So, total eights in tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 =49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but wait, when counting the tens place for eights, I had 480-488 as 9 numbers, but let me check that again. From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. Yep, that's 9. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, the total eights are 49 in units, 49 in tens, totaling 98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90.

So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488 with step 10. Let me calculate how many numbers that is. The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1.

So, tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because I might have made a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me check the tens place for eights again. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 eights in tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49, correct. Units place: 8,18,...488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 eights. So, total eights: 49+49=98. Fours: 188. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when counting the hundreds place for fours, I considered 400-488 as 89 numbers. Let me confirm: 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89, correct. So, that seems right. Units place for fours: 4,14,...484. 484 is the 49th number because 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place for fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. So, that adds up. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Eights: 49+49=98. Difference: 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

So, that's 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

    "text": " Now, adding up all the fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Wait, let me double-check that. Units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds:89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems right. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is included. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, 8, 18, 28,..., 488. Let me count: from 0 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, plus one more for 488? Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each block contributes 10 eights except the last one. Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 + 10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that right? From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4 times 10 is 40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Wait, let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, so total 98 eights. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with fours:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then every 10 numbers. The last one is 484, which is 484/10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. So, 49 fours in units place.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49:10,140-149:10,240-249:10,340-349:10,440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours in tens place.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488:89 numbers, so 89 fours in hundreds place.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow for eights:\n\n- Units place:8,18,28,...,488. The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in units place.\n\n- Tens place:80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in tens place.\n\n- Hundreds place: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for eights. For example, in the 480-488 range, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. Each has 8 in the tens place, so that's 9. So, 10 each for the first four sets, and 9 for the last, totaling 49. That seems right.\n\nSimilarly, for fours in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** \n   - Pages ending with 4: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Pages with 4 in the tens digit: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Pages with 4 in the hundreds digit: 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Pages ending with 8: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Pages with 8 in the tens digit: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9.\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it does. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. Each of these has an 8 in the units place. So, from 8 to 488, that's (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. Let me see how many numbers have 8 in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, as 488 is the last). Wait, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, total eights in tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part gives 48, but wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The first is 8, then 18, ..., 488. So, how many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488. Solving for n: 10(n-1) = 480, so n-1 = 48, so n=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so does 480-489 count? Yes, because 488 is included. So, how many sets of 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place? From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 is the last page). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right.

    "text": " Now, let me add up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. For the units place, I thought 484 is the last 4 in the units place. So, from 4 to 484, stepping by 10 each time, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So that's correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 in the tens place, and there are 5 hundreds (0-4), but wait, actually, from 0-488, the hundreds digit is 4 only in 400-488. So, maybe I overcounted the tens place. Wait, no, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. So that's correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is the 49th term because (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but 489 is beyond 488, so only up to 488. So, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). Wait, no, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, total tens place eights: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. Wait, that's 49. Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So total 10*4 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. So, number of fours is 188, number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for eights. In the tens place, I had 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. That adds up to 10+10+10+10+9=49. So that's correct. So, total eights:49+49=98. Fours:188. So, 188-98=90.

I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. To find how many, I can do 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: starting at 8, each 10 numbers adds one 8. So from 8 to 488, how many? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then the 49th group includes 488. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also have tens digit 8? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 would have the tens digit 8. Let me count how many sets there are. Each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-488 is actually 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, for the hundreds place: 400-488, so the tens digit 8 is only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0, total 98. 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me verify the counts again, especially for the tens place in fours and eights. For fours in the tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. That's correct. For eights in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. That's correct. Units place for fours: from 4,14,...,484. 484 is the 49th number because (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. Correct. Similarly, units place for eights: from 8,18,...,488. 488 is the 49th number. Correct. Hundreds place for fours: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. Hundreds place for eights: none, since the book ends at 488. So, yes, 188 fours and 98 eights, so 90 more fours.

    "text": " Now, adding up all the fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484. So, how many terms? The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is not a full hundred, but for the tens place, it's still 10 numbers per hundred. Wait, no, in 400-488, the tens digit can be 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 5 sets of 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 +89=188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, which is in the units place. So, using the same method as before: (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488. So, how many tens places have 8? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9 because 488 is the last page, so 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers (from 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up the eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, starting at 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 count? Since the book goes up to 488, 480-488 is included. So, each of these blocks has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so that's 9 instead of 10. So, total eights in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences except the last block, which contributes 9.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many numbers is that? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The first is 8, and the last is 488. To find how many terms there are, I can calculate (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the book since it goes up to 488. So, let's count each set: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 +9 =49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that can't be right because 188 -98 is 90. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours: units place: 4,14,...,484. That's from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 =48 +1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 fours, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct. Now for the eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. That's (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 eights, and the last set has 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again. When counting the hundreds place for fours, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, correct. And for the tens place, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. For the eights, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, correct. So, I think my calculations are correct.

    "text": " Now, let me add up all the fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 10n - 6 = 484. So, 10n = 490, n=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: Each hundred block has 10 fours in the tens place, so 40-49, 140-149, etc. Up to 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is included. So, how many terms? The first term is 8, the last is 488. The nth term is 10n - 2 = 488. So, 10n = 490, n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be next, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488. So, let's count each block. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). Wait, no: from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in all these, so that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9. So, 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one block of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98 eights. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188-98=90. Wait, that can't be right because I think I might have made a mistake in counting the eights in the tens place. Let me check again. When counting eights in the tens place: 80-89: 10 eights. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. So, 49 eights in tens place, 49 in units place, total 98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. Maybe I overcounted the fours in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. Units place: 49 fours, tens place:50 fours, hundreds:89, total 188. Eights: units 49, tens 49, total 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, especially in the hundreds place, I might have missed something. Let me think about the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. So, 89 fours there. So, I think my count is correct. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

That's 49 numbers. Tens place: Each hundred block has 10, and there are 4 full hundreds (1-400), so 4*10=40, but wait, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, but the tens digit in 400-488 can still have 4's in the tens place, like 440-449. Wait, maybe I'm overcounting. Let me think again. Maybe I should separate the hundreds place count from the tens and units. So, hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 fours. Tens place: In each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers.

Wait, in the tens place, it's 40-49,140-149, etc. So, up to 400-488, which includes 440-449. So, each hundred block up to 400 has 10, and then from 400-488, another 10 (440-449).

From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488.

Let me check how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but let's see if 488 is included. 488 is the last page, so yes, it's included. So, from 8, 18, ..., 488, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but since the book ends at 488, we have 480-488. So, how many sets of 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 +9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many times that happens. The first 8 is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but does 480-489 count? Since the book only goes up to 488, 480-488 would have 8 in the tens place. Let's check each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, does 488 count? Yes, because it's the last page. So, how many such numbers? Starting at 8, each step of 10. The last one is 488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we have 49 numbers (including both 8 and 488). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it.

Units place: 4,14,...,484: that's 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10): 50 numbers. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers.

So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because from 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 5 blocks, but the last one has 9 instead of 10. So, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10*4 +9 = 40 +9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total number of eights is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, let me check that again. Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 49 eights. So, total eights: 98. Now, number of fours was 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours and eights. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me double-check the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, inclusive. 488 - 400 +1 = 89. That's correct.

From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 =89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place, which is correct. For the tens place of fours, from 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each of those is 10 numbers, and there are 5 sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), so 5x10=50. That's correct. Units place for fours: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, up to 484. So, 484 is the 49th occurrence. Correct. For eights, units place:49, tens place:49. Wait, but in the tens place, I had 480-488 as 9 numbers, but let me count them: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers, so yes, 9 eights in the tens place from 480-488. So, 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9 makes 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place:49. So, total eights:98. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** Every 10 numbers contribute one 4.

    "text": " Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 4 + 10(n-1). So, 484 = 4 + 10(n-1). 484 - 4 = 10(n-1). 480 = 10(n-1). So, n-1 = 48, so n=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place. From 0-99: 10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488: how many? Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, but the tens digit is 4 only for 40-49, but in 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, etc., up to 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. Wait, but 400-409 is 10 numbers, 410-419 is another 10, and so on up to 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? So, how many full tens are there? From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, for the tens digit being 4, it's 400-409 (10 numbers), 410-419 (but tens digit is 1, so not 4), wait no, I'm getting confused. Wait, the tens digit is 4 in 400-488 when the tens digit is 4, regardless of the units. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, etc., but wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the tens digit is 4 in numbers where the second digit is 4. So, in 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. So, that's 10 numbers: 440-449. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 10 in each hundred, but in the hundreds place, it's only 10 in the 400s. Wait, no, actually, in the tens place, for each hundred, like 0-99, 100-199, etc., the tens digit is 4 in 10 numbers each. So, from 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. So, that's correct. Now, hundreds place: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The last term is 488, which is 8 in the units place. The nth term is 8 + 10(n-1). So, 488 = 8 + 10(n-1). 488 -8 = 480 =10(n-1). So, n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199:180-189 (10). From 200-299:280-289 (10). From 300-399:380-389 (10). From 400-488:480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 is the last page. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 0-399) and 9 in 400-488. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake with the ranges. For units place, 4's: from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers, which is 49 numbers. For 8's, units place: from 8 to 488, which is also 49 numbers. Tens place: 4's: 5 sets of 10, so 50. 8's: 4 full sets of 10 (0-399) and 9 in 400-488, total 49. Hundreds place: 4's: 89, 8's:0. So, 4's total: 49+50+89=188. 8's total:49+49+0=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. So, yes, that's correct. For the tens place, 4's: 50, 8's:49. Units: both 49. So, total 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

The first four sets have 10 each, and the last set has 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1 four, and then an extra 4 in 484. So that's 49 fours in the units place. Tens place: each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place. From 1-400, that's 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the hundreds digit is 4, but the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is another 10 fours. So total tens fours: 40 +10=50. Hundreds place: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So total fours: 49 +50 +89=188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's.

So, 48 +1=49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Now, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 has 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place (480-488). Wait, no, 480 has 8 in the tens place, 481, ..., 488. So, how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, let's count: Each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) up to 400 has 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 sets (1-400) would give 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the number of fours is 188 and eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, plus 89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for eights. Let me recount that. In the tens place, each hundred block (like 1-100) has 10 eights (80-89). So, from 1-400, that's 4 blocks, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, right? Because 488-480=8, but inclusive, so 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49.

    "text": " Now, adding up all the fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct. Tens place: Each hundred block contributes 10, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 +50 +89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many terms there are. The last term is 488, so (488 -8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Let me calculate how many sets there are. Each block of 100 has 10 eights in the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but each of these has an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 eights. So total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 from 480-488, which is 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98 eights. So, number of fours is 188, number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90.

Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 exist? Yes, but since the book goes up to 488, we only have up to 488. So, how many sets? 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page).

So that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49.

Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The last occurrence is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Each full hundred has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, so from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page). So, 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for eights. Let me recount the tens place for eights. Each hundred block has 10 eights in the tens place, so from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4 full sets and one partial set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That's correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. Wait, but when I think about the hundreds place for fours, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers. But when I add the units and tens, I might have overlapping counts. Wait, no, because when counting each digit place separately, overlaps are allowed because each digit is counted in its own position. So, for example, 440 has two 4's, but each is counted in both the hundreds and tens place. So, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4, 14, 24, ..., 484: There are 49 such numbers.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 fours in the tens place.\n   - 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449: 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Numbers 400-488: 89 fours.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8, 18, 28, ..., 488: 49 such numbers.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place.\n   - 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488: 4 full blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Now, let me add them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8*49=482, wait no, 8 is the units digit every 10 numbers, so 8,18,...,488. How many terms? The nth term is 10n - 2, where n starts at 1. So, 10n - 2 = 488 \u2192 10n = 490 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many numbers in each set: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the number of fours is 188 and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This is 49 numbers (from 0 to 484, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours, totaling 50 fours.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - There are 89 such numbers, contributing 89 fours.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188 fours**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This is 49 numbers.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours, except the last which contributes 9, totaling 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98 eights**\n\n**Difference:** 188 fours - 98 eights = **90 more fours**\n\n\\boxed{90}"
