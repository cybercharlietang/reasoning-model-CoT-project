    "text": " 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3000 * \u03c0 = 9424.77796, 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 100\u03c0 \u2248 314.15926535, 80\u03c0 \u2248 251.32741229, 3\u03c0 \u2248 9.42477796. Adding those: 314.15926535 + 251.32741229 = 565.48667764 + 9.42477796 \u2248 574.9114556. So, total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796 + 574.9114556 \u2248 9999.6894156. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.6894156 \u2248 0.0001000031. So, that's approximately 0.0001000031, which is just barely above 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, for n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 1003.5, so 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009965, which is just below 0.001, so it's included as well. Therefore, n=319 to n=3183 are all valid, giving x-intercepts within the open interval. So, the total number is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Wait, but let me check: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that seems correct. But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial inequality, let me verify again. Starting with x in (0.0001, 0.001), which is equivalent to 1/x in (1000, 10000). Because if x is 0.0001, 1/x is 10000, and if x is 0.001, 1/x is 1000. But since the interval is open, 1/x is in (1000, 10000). So, 1/x must be greater than 1000 and less than 10000. Now, since y = sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so n\u03c0 must be in (1000, 10000). Therefore, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing all parts by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating those: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be integers greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184. Therefore, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, that confirms it again. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but just to make sure, let me think about whether each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept. Since sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches zero, and each time 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0, the function crosses zero. So, each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept in the interval. Therefore, the total number is indeed 2865. So, after all that, I think the answer is 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial step where I set sin(1/x) = 0. So, sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 = k\u03c0 for integer k. So, 1/x = k\u03c0, so x = 1/(k\u03c0). So, x must be in (0.0001, 0.001), so 1/(k\u03c0) must be in that interval. Therefore, 0.0001 < 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001, which is equivalent to 1000 < k\u03c0 < 10000. So, k must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < k < 10000/\u03c0, which is the same as before. So, k ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 intercepts. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\). This occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for some integer \\( n \\), which implies \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n\nWe need \\( x \\) to be within the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\). This translates to:\n\\[ 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\]\n\nRewriting these inequalities:\n\\[ 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\implies n < \\frac{1}{0.0001\\pi} \\approx 3183.098 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\implies n > \\frac{1}{0.001\\pi} \\approx 318.309 \\]\n\nThus, \\( n \\) must be an integer in the range from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers in this range is calculated as:\n\\[ 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts is \\(\\boxed{2865}\\)."

Let's compute 3183 * 3 = 9549. 3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, 3183 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.001 = 3.183, and 3183 * 0.0005926535 \u2248 approximately 3183 * 0.0005 = 1.5915, and 3183 * 0.0000926535 \u2248 approximately 0.295. So adding those up: 3.183 + 1.5915 = 4.7745 + 0.295 \u2248 5.0695. So total for 0.1415926535 is approximately 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.0695 \u2248 450.6895. So total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9549 + 450.6895 \u2248 9999.6895. Therefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.6895 \u2248 0.0001000031. So, that's just a bit over 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, for n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0). Let's compute 319\u03c0: 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 319 * 3 = 957, 319 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 319 * 0.1 = 31.9, 319 * 0.04 = 12.76, 319 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 approximately 319 * 0.001 = 0.319, and 319 * 0.0005926535 \u2248 approximately 0.189. So adding up: 31.9 + 12.76 = 44.66 + 0.319 \u2248 44.979 + 0.189 \u2248 45.168. So total 319\u03c0 \u2248 957 + 45.168 \u2248 1001.168. Therefore, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1001.168 \u2248 0.0009988, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval. So, both n=319 and n=3183 give x-values within the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is indeed 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Wait, but let me just check: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, the function y = sin(1/x) crosses the x-axis 2865 times between 0.0001 and 0.001. That seems like a lot, but given how rapidly sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches zero, it makes sense. As x approaches zero, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times, but in our case, we're only looking between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a small interval near zero, but still, the number of oscillations is quite high. So, I think my reasoning is correct.

So, total 3183\u03c0 \u22489424.77796 +574.946\u22489999.72396. Therefore, 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22481/9999.72396\u22480.00010000277. So, that's approximately 0.00010000277, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=3184: x=1/(3184\u03c0). Let's see: 3184\u03c0\u22483184*3.1415926535\u22483184*3=9552, 3184*0.1415926535\u22483184*0.1=318.4, 3184*0.0415926535\u22483184*0.04=127.36, 3184*0.0015926535\u22485.07. So, adding up: 318.4 +127.36=445.76 +5.07\u2248450.83. So, total 3184\u03c0\u22489552 +450.83\u22489999.83. So, 1/(3184\u03c0)\u22481/9999.83\u22480.0001000017, which is still just above 0.0001. Wait, but 3183\u03c0\u22489999.72396, so 3183\u03c0 is less than 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Similarly, 3184\u03c0\u22489999.83, which is still less than 10000, so 1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0001000017, which is greater than 0.0001. Wait, but when does 1/(n\u03c0) become less than or equal to 0.0001? Let's solve for n when 1/(n\u03c0) = 0.0001. So, n = 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.098. So, n must be greater than 3183.098 to have 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.0001. Since n must be an integer, the smallest n that satisfies 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.0001 is n=3184. But wait, in our initial calculation, n=3183 gives x\u22480.00010000277, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 is included, but n=3184 would give x\u22480.0001000017, which is still above 0.0001, so it's also included. Wait, but if n=3184 gives x\u22480.0001000017, which is still greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Wait, but when does 1/(n\u03c0) become less than or equal to 0.0001? Let's compute n=3183: x\u22480.00010000277 >0.0001, included. n=3184: x\u22480.0001000017 >0.0001, included. Wait, but this can't be right because 1/(n\u03c0) decreases as n increases, so as n increases beyond 3183, x decreases, approaching 0.0001 from above. Wait, but 0.0001 is 10^{-4}, and 0.00010000277 is just barely above that. So, actually, all n from 319 up to 3183 will give x in (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let's check n=3183: x\u22480.00010000277, which is greater than 0.0001, so included. n=3184: x\u22480.0001000017, which is still greater than 0.0001, included. Wait, but if n=3183 gives x\u22480.00010000277, which is greater than 0.0001, then n=3183 is included, but n=3184 would give x\u22480.0001000017, which is also greater than 0.0001, so it's included as well. Wait, but this seems like n can go beyond 3183 and still have x > 0.0001. Wait, but that can't be, because as n increases, x decreases. So, there must be a point where x becomes less than or equal to 0.0001. Let me solve for n when 1/(n\u03c0) = 0.0001. So, n = 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u22483183.098. So, when n=3183, x\u22480.00010000277>0.0001, so included. When n=3184, x\u22480.0001000017>0.0001, still included. Wait, but that's not possible because 3184\u03c0\u22489999.83, which is less than 10000, so 1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0001000017>0.0001. Wait, but when n=3183, 3183\u03c0\u22489999.72396, so 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00010000277>0.0001. Similarly, n=3184: 3184\u03c0\u22489999.83, so 1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0001000017>0.0001. Wait, but if n=3183.098, then 1/(n\u03c0)=0.0001. So, for n>3183.098, 1/(n\u03c0)<0.0001. So, n must be greater than 3183.098 to have x<0.0001. But since n must be integer, the smallest n where x<0.0001 is n=3184. But wait, when n=3184, x\u22480.0001000017>0.0001, which is still above. So, perhaps my earlier calculation is off. Wait, let me compute 3184\u03c0 more accurately. Let's compute 3184 * \u03c0:\n\n3184 * \u03c0 \u2248 3184 * 3.1415926535\n\nFirst, 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796\n\n184\u03c0 \u2248 184 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 100\u03c0\u2248314.1592654, 80\u03c0\u2248251.3274123, 4\u03c0\u224812.56637061\n\nAdding those up: 314.1592654 + 251.3274123 = 565.4866777 +12.56637061\u2248578.0530483\n\nSo, 3184\u03c0 \u22489424.77796 +578.0530483\u224810002.83101\n\nWait, that can't be right because 3184\u03c0 should be close to 3183\u03c0\u22489999.72396, so 3184\u03c0\u22489999.72396 +\u03c0\u22489999.72396 +3.1415926535\u224810002.86555\n\nWait, that's not correct because 3183\u03c0\u22489999.72396, so 3184\u03c0=3183\u03c0 +\u03c0\u22489999.72396 +3.1415926535\u224810002.86555\n\nWait, but that would mean 3184\u03c0\u224810002.86555, so 1/(3184\u03c0)\u22481/10002.86555\u22480.0000999715, which is less than 0.0001.\n\nWait, so that's different from my earlier calculation. I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me correct this.\n\nSo, 3183\u03c0\u22489999.72396, so 3184\u03c0\u22489999.72396 +3.1415926535\u224810002.86555.\n\nTherefore, 1/(3184\u03c0)\u22481/10002.86555\u22480.0000999715, which is less than 0.0001.\n\nSo, that means when n=3184, x\u22480.0000999715<0.0001, so it's not included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier calculation where I thought n=3184 gives x\u22480.0001000017. I must have made a mistake in the earlier multiplication. So, to clarify:\n\n3183\u03c0\u22489999.72396\n\n3184\u03c0=3183\u03c0 + \u03c0\u22489999.72396 +3.1415926535\u224810002.86555\n\nTherefore, 1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0000999715<0.0001, so n=3184 gives x\u22480.0000999715, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included in the interval.\n\nSimilarly, n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00010000277>0.0001, so included.\n\nSo, the maximum n that gives x>0.0001 is n=3183, and n=3184 gives x<0.0001, which is excluded.\n\nTherefore, the range of n is from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nThus, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another approach. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. Between x=0.0001 and x=0.001, how many times does it cross the x-axis? Each oscillation corresponds to a zero crossing when 1/x increases by \u03c0. So, the number of zeros is approximately the difference in 1/x divided by \u03c0, but adjusted for the interval.\n\nSo, let's compute 1/x at both ends:\n\nAt x=0.001, 1/x=1000.\n\nAt x=0.0001, 1/x=10000.\n\nSo, the interval for \u03b8=1/x is from 1000 to 10000.\n\nEach zero occurs at \u03b8=n\u03c0, so the number of zeros is the number of n where n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 <10000.\n\nDividing by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248318.309 < n <10000/\u03c0\u22483183.098.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 3183 -319 +1=2865 zeros.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nI think that's consistent with my earlier calculation. So, the final answer is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n gives 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

So, adding up: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62, plus 3.183 = 448.803, plus 1.887 \u2248 450.69. So total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9549 + 450.69 \u2248 9999.69. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.69 \u2248 0.000100003. So, that's 0.000100003, which is just barely above 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=3183 is included. Therefore, the total number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me think again: when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0). Let me compute that: 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 319*3=957, 319*0.1416\u224845.11. So, total \u2248 957 + 45.11 \u2248 1002.11. So, 1/1002.11 \u2248 0.00099789, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, n=319 gives x\u22480.00099789, which is within (0.0001, 0.001). So, yes, n=319 is included. Therefore, the count is correct at 2865. Wait, but let me check if n=3183 is indeed the last n where x > 0.0001. Let me compute n=3184: x=1/(3184\u03c0). 3184 * \u03c0 \u2248 3184*3.1416\u22483184*3=9552, 3184*0.1416\u2248451.3. So, total\u22489552+451.3\u22489993.3. So, 1/9993.3\u22480.000100067, which is still greater than 0.0001, so x=0.000100067 is still in (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but wait, if n=3184 gives x\u22480.000100067, which is still greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Wait, but earlier I thought n=3183 was the last n where x>0.0001. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me check n=3183: x\u22480.000100003, which is just above 0.0001. n=3184: x\u22481/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.000100067, which is also above 0.0001. So, actually, n can go higher than 3183 and still have x>0.0001. Wait, this suggests that my initial upper bound for n was too low. Wait, because 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0)\u22483183.098. So, n can be up to 3183, because 3183 < 3183.098, but 3184 would be greater than 3183.098, so n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.000100067, which is greater than 0.0001, but wait, no, 0.000100067 is greater than 0.0001, so it's still in the interval. Wait, but according to the inequality, n must be less than 1/(0.0001\u03c0)\u22483183.098, so n=3183 is allowed, but n=3184 would be n>3183.098, which would give x=1/(3184\u03c0)<0.0001. Wait, but my calculation shows that 1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.000100067, which is greater than 0.0001, so perhaps my inequality is reversed.\n\nWait, let's clarify: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than 3183.098, meaning n can be up to 3183, because 3183 < 3183.098. But when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000100003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. If n=3184, then x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.000100067, which is still above 0.0001, so it's included. Wait, that contradicts the inequality because n=3184 is greater than 3183.098, so according to the inequality, n should be less than 3183.098, meaning n=3183 is the maximum integer. But my calculation shows that n=3184 still gives x>0.0001. So, perhaps my initial inequality was incorrect.\n\nWait, let me re-express the inequality correctly. We have 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. Solving for n: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001 \u21d2 n\u03c0 < 10000 \u21d2 n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than 3183.098. Therefore, the maximum integer n is 3183, because 3183 < 3183.098, and 3184 would be greater than 3183.098, which would make n\u03c0 >= 3184\u03c0 \u2248 10000.1, so 1/(n\u03c0) <= 0.0001. But wait, 3184\u03c0 \u2248 10000.1, so 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3184 gives x just below 0.0001, which is excluded. So, the maximum n is 3183, because n=3183 gives x\u22480.000100003, which is just above 0.0001, so included. Therefore, my initial calculation was correct, and n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought about n=3184, I thought x was still above 0.0001, but perhaps my approximation was off. Let me compute 3184\u03c0 more accurately. Let me compute 3184 * \u03c0:\n\n\u03c0 \u2248 3.1415926535\n\n3184 * 3 = 9552\n\n3184 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3184 * 0.1 = 318.4\n\n3184 * 0.0415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3184 * 0.04 = 127.36\n\n3184 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 3184 * 0.001 = 3.184\n\n3184 * 0.0005926535 \u2248 approx 1.892\n\nSo adding up: 318.4 + 127.36 = 445.76 + 3.184 = 448.944 + 1.892 \u2248 450.836\n\nSo total 3184\u03c0 \u2248 9552 + 450.836 \u2248 9992.836\n\nSo, 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/9992.836 \u2248 0.000100072\n\nWait, that's approximately 0.000100072, which is greater than 0.0001, so x=0.000100072 is included in (0.0001, 0.001). But according to the inequality, n must be less than 3183.098, so n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.000100072>0.0001, which is included. But wait, that contradicts the inequality because n=3184>3183.098, so according to the inequality, x should be less than 0.0001. But my calculation shows it's still above. So, perhaps my initial inequality was incorrect.\n\nWait, let me re-express the inequality correctly. If 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, then n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than 3183.098. Therefore, the maximum integer n is 3183. But when I compute n=3184, I get x\u22480.000100072, which is still greater than 0.0001, meaning that n=3184 is still allowed. So, perhaps my initial inequality is wrong.\n\nWait, let me think again: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than 3183.098. Therefore, n can be up to 3183, because 3183 < 3183.098, but 3184 would be greater than 3183.098, so 1/(3184\u03c0) < 0.0001. But my calculation shows that 1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.000100072>0.0001, which suggests that perhaps my approximation is off. Let me compute 3184\u03c0 more accurately.\n\nUsing a calculator: 3184 * \u03c0 \u2248 3184 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796\n\n184\u03c0 \u2248 184 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 184*3=552, 184*0.1415926535\u224826.052, so total\u2248552+26.052\u2248578.052\n\nSo, total 3184\u03c0\u22489424.77796 + 578.052\u22489992.82996\n\nTherefore, 1/(3184\u03c0)\u22481/9992.82996\u22480.000100072, which is indeed greater than 0.0001. So, n=3184 gives x\u22480.000100072, which is still within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, my initial inequality must be incorrect because n=3184 is allowed, but according to the inequality, n must be less than 3183.098, which would exclude n=3184. So, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the inequality.\n\nWait, let's go back. The inequality is 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than 3183.098, meaning the maximum integer n is 3183. But our calculation shows that n=3184 gives x\u22480.000100072>0.0001, which is still in the interval. Therefore, the inequality must be incorrect. Wait, no, because 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0). So, n=3184 would give 1/(3184\u03c0)=0.000100072>0.0001, which satisfies the inequality, meaning that n=3184 is allowed, which contradicts the inequality that n must be less than 3183.098. Therefore, my initial approach is flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's consider that x must be in (0.0001, 0.001). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Therefore, taking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities because reciprocating positive numbers reverses the inequality):\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing all parts by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nCalculating:\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184\n\n10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, n must satisfy 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184\n\nSince n is an integer, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nWait, that's the same result as before, but now when I compute n=3184, I get x\u22480.000100072, which is still in the interval. So, why is n=3184 not included?\n\nWait, because 3184 > 3183.09886184, so n=3184 is outside the upper bound, which is approximately 3183.09886184. So, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so the maximum integer n is 3183. Therefore, n=3184 is excluded because it's greater than 3183.09886184, so x=1/(3184\u03c0)=\u22480.000100072>0.0001, but according to the inequality, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so n=3184 is not allowed. But wait, our calculation shows that n=3184 still gives x>0.0001, which is included in the interval. So, perhaps the problem is that the inequality is strict: n must be less than 3183.09886184, so n=3183 is allowed, but n=3184 is not, even though x=1/(3184\u03c0) is still greater than 0.0001.\n\nWait, let me check with exact values. Let's compute 3183\u03c0 and 3184\u03c0.\n\n3183\u03c0 = 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 3000\u03c0\u22489424.77796, 183\u03c0\u2248183*3.1415926535\u2248575.01999, so total\u22489424.77796+575.01999\u22489999.79795\n\nSimilarly, 3184\u03c0\u22483184*3.1415926535\u22483183\u03c0 + \u03c0\u22489999.79795 + 3.1415926535\u224810002.93954\n\nTherefore, 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22481/9999.79795\u22480.000100002\n\nAnd 1/(3184\u03c0)\u22481/10002.93954\u22480.0000999705\n\nWait, so 1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0000999705, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, my earlier calculation was incorrect because I miscalculated 3184\u03c0 as approximately 9992.82996, but the correct value is approximately 10002.93954, so 1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0000999705<0.0001. Therefore, n=3184 gives x\u22480.0000999705, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded.\n\nTherefore, the maximum n is 3183, which gives x\u22480.000100002>0.0001, so included.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I might have confused myself with the approximations earlier, but after recalculating, it seems that n=3184 gives x just below 0.0001, which is excluded, so the maximum n is indeed 3183.\n\nSo, the final answer is 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, leading to x = 1/(n\u03c0). For x in (0.0001, 0.001), n ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

So total for 183\u03c0 is approximately 565.48667 + 9.42477796 \u2248 574.911447. So, total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796 + 574.911447 \u2248 9999.689407. Therefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.689407 \u2248 0.000100003125. So, that's approximately 0.000100003, which is indeed just over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, for n=319, 319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477796, 19\u03c0 \u2248 59.6902604. So, total 319\u03c0 \u2248 942.477796 + 59.6902604 \u2248 1002.168056. Therefore, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.168056 \u2248 0.00099786, which is approximately 0.00099786, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval. Therefore, n=319 gives x \u2248 0.00099786, which is within (0.0001, 0.001), and n=3183 gives x \u2248 0.000100003, which is also within the interval. So, both endpoints are included, so the count from n=319 to n=3183 inclusive is correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but let me make sure that I'm not missing any intercepts or counting any extra. Each n corresponds to exactly one x in the interval, and since n ranges continuously from 319 to 3183 without skipping any integers, each x is unique and within the interval. So, the total number should indeed be 2865. But just to be absolutely certain, let me consider how the function behaves. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0, which is why in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), the function oscillates very rapidly. Each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the sine function completes a half-period, crossing zero. So, the number of zeros should correspond to how many times 1/x can decrease from 10000 down to 1000 as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001. Wait, actually, as x increases, 1/x decreases, so 1/x goes from 10000 down to 1000. So, the number of zeros would be how many times 1/x passes through each multiple of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000. Wait, that's a different way to think about it. Let me see: 1/x = \u03b8, so \u03b8 goes from 1000 to 10000 as x goes from 0.001 to 0.0001. So, \u03b8 \u2208 (1000, 10000). The zeros occur at \u03b8 = n\u03c0, where n is integer. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Solving for n: n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is exactly what I found earlier. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's solid. I've checked it from different angles, and each time, I arrive at the same conclusion. So, I'm confident that the answer is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Solving for x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) gives n ranging from 319 to 3183, resulting in 2865 intercepts.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.54576, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.54576 \u2248 0.0001000046, which is indeed greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval.

So total \u2248 318.4 + 127.36 = 445.76 + 5.06 \u2248 450.82. So, 3184\u03c0 \u2248 9552 + 450.82 \u2248 9999.82. So, 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.82 \u2248 0.0001000018, which is still greater than 0.0001, so n=3184 would give x=0.0001000018, which is still in the interval. Wait, but earlier I thought n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001000028, which is in the interval, but n=3184 gives x\u22480.0001000018, which is even closer to 0.0001. Wait, but does this mean that n can go beyond 3183? Wait, no, because 3183\u03c0 is approximately 9999.54576, so 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001000046, which is greater than 0.0001, so included. Similarly, n=3184: 3184\u03c0\u22489999.82, so 1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0001000018, which is still greater than 0.0001, so included. Wait, but then how high does n go? Because as n increases, x decreases, approaching zero. But our interval is up to x=0.001. Wait, no, our interval is (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express the inequalities correctly. We have x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), we have:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n1/(0.001) > n\u03c0 > 1/(0.0001)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n1000 > n\u03c0 > 10000\n\nDividing all parts by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 > n > 10000/\u03c0\n\nWhich is approximately:\n\n318.309 > n > 3183.098\n\nWait, that's the same as before, but now I'm confused because earlier I thought n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001000046, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. But if n must be greater than 3183.098, then n must be at least 3184. Wait, no, wait: the inequality is n > 10000/\u03c0 \u22483183.098, so n must be greater than 3183.098, meaning the smallest integer n is 3184. Similarly, n < 1000/\u03c0 \u2248318.309, so the largest integer n is 318. Wait, but that contradicts what I had earlier. Wait, no, wait, I think I messed up the inequality direction. Let me carefully re-express the inequalities.\n\nStarting with 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nFirst, solving 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001:\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0 (positive, so inequality remains):\n\n1 > 0.0001 * n\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by 0.0001\u03c0:\n\n1 / (0.0001\u03c0) > n\n\nWhich is 10000 / \u03c0 > n \u22483183.098 > n\n\nSimilarly, solving 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001:\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0:\n\n1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by 0.001\u03c0:\n\n1 / (0.001\u03c0) < n \u2248318.309 < n\n\nSo, combining both inequalities:\n\n318.309 < n < 3183.098\n\nSince n must be an integer, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nWait, so earlier conclusion was correct. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought about n=3184, I saw that 1/(3184\u03c0) is still greater than 0.0001, but according to the inequality, n must be less than 3183.098, so n=3183 is the maximum. So, n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0001000018, which is still in the interval, but according to the inequality, n must be less than 3183.098, so n=3183 is the maximum integer n. Therefore, n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0001000018, which is still greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Wait, but according to the inequality, n must be less than 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183. So, n=3183 is allowed, but n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0001000018, which is still in (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but according to the inequality, n must be less than 3183.098, so n=3183 is allowed, but n=3184 would be 3184 >3183.098, which would not satisfy n <3183.098. Therefore, n=3184 is not allowed, because n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183.\n\nWait, but when I calculated n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001000046, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. So, n=3183 is allowed, but n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0001000018, which is still greater than 0.0001, but n=3184 is greater than 3183.098, so it's not allowed. Therefore, the maximum n is 3183.\n\nSimilarly, the minimum n is 319, because n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check with n=319 and n=3183 to ensure that x is within the interval.\n\nFor n=319:\n\nx=1/(319\u03c0)\u22481/(1003.5)\u22480.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nFor n=3183:\n\nx=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001000046, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nSo, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive give x in (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me compute 3183 - 319:\n\n3183 - 300 = 2883\n\n2883 - 19 = 2864\n\nSo, 2864, plus 1 is 2865.\n\nSo, the final answer is 2865.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about the function y=sin(1/x). As x approaches zero from the positive side, 1/x approaches infinity, and sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. But in our case, we're looking at x between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a small interval near zero. The function sin(1/x) will cross the x-axis every time 1/x increases by \u03c0, which corresponds to x decreasing by a factor related to \u03c0. So, the number of zeros should be proportional to the change in 1/x divided by \u03c0, which is exactly what we calculated. So, the number of zeros is approximately (1/(0.0001) - 1/(0.001))/\u03c0 = (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 = 9000/\u03c0 \u22482866.197. But since we're dealing with integers, it's 2865, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, which gives x = 1/(n\u03c0). For x in (0.0001, 0.001), n ranges from 319 to 3183, resulting in 2865 x-intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

Let's compute 3183 * \u03c0: \u03c0 \u2248 3.141592653589793. So, 3183 * 3.141592653589793. Let's break it down:\n\n3183 * 3 = 9549\n3183 * 0.141592653589793 \u2248 Let's compute 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3\n3183 * 0.04 = 127.32\n3183 * 0.001592653589793 \u2248 3183 * 0.001 = 3.183, and 3183 * 0.000592653589793 \u2248 approximately 3183 * 0.0006 \u2248 1.9098.

So, that means n can go up to 3183, but wait, if n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001000028, which is just above 0.0001, and n=3184 gives x\u22480.0001000015, which is also just above 0.0001. Wait, but that seems contradictory because as n increases, x should decrease. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check 3183\u03c0 and 3184\u03c0.\n\nWait, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.7128, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000028.\n\n3184\u03c0 \u2248 3183\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2248 9999.7128 + 3.1415926535 \u2248 10002.8544.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. 3184\u03c0 = 3183\u03c0 + \u03c0, so if 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.7128, then 3184\u03c0 \u2248 9999.7128 + 3.1415926535 \u2248 10002.8544.\n\nTherefore, 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/10002.8544 \u2248 0.0000999715, which is approximately 0.0000999715, which is less than 0.0001.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, n=3184 gives x\u22480.0000999715, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3184 is excluded. So, the maximum n is 3183, because n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001000028, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another approach. Let me consider the function y = sin(1/x). The x-intercepts occur where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let's solve for n:\n\nFirst inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098.\n\nSecond inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 318.309 < n < 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nNumber of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about the behavior of the function. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly as x approaches 0. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is close to zero, the function oscillates very rapidly. Each oscillation corresponds to a period of 2\u03c0 in the argument 1/x. So, the number of oscillations (and thus the number of x-intercepts) is proportional to 1/x. Specifically, the number of zeros between x=a and x=b is approximately (1/a - 1/b)/\u03c0. Wait, let me think about that.\n\nThe function sin(\u03b8) has a zero every \u03c0 interval in \u03b8. So, if \u03b8 = 1/x, then d\u03b8/dx = -1/x\u00b2. So, the number of zeros between x=a and x=b would be the change in \u03b8 divided by \u03c0. So, from \u03b8=1/b to \u03b8=1/a, the change in \u03b8 is (1/a - 1/b). So, number of zeros is approximately (1/a - 1/b)/\u03c0. But since we're dealing with open intervals, we might need to adjust, but for large a and b close to zero, this approximation should hold.\n\nLet me compute that: (1/0.0001 - 1/0.001)/\u03c0 = (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 = 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.198. Hmm, that's approximately 2866, which is close to our earlier count of 2865. The slight difference is due to the endpoints not being included and the approximation. So, this gives me more confidence that the number is around 2865.\n\nTherefore, after all this thinking and checking, I believe the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

So, 1/(9999.691) \u2248 0.000100003, which is indeed just above 0.0001, so x = 0.000100003 is in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 is included.

Similarly, n=318 gives x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22481/(1000.0)\u22480.001, which is the upper limit, but since the interval is open, n=318 would give x=0.001, which is excluded. Therefore, n starts at 319.

Therefore, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1001.166 \u2248 0.00099883, which is just below 0.001, so included in the interval. If we take n=318, then x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22481/(1000.0)\u22480.001, but since 318\u03c0\u22481000.0, so 1/(318\u03c0)=0.001 exactly. But since our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, x=0.001 is excluded. So, n=318 would give x=0.001, which is not included. Therefore, n starts at 319, giving x\u22480.00099883, which is just below 0.001, included. So, the range of n is from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Wait, but let me check this calculation again. 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 = 2865. Yes, that seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me think again: does each n correspond to exactly one x-intercept? Yes, because each n gives a unique x in the interval. So, the function sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times as x approaches 0, but in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), it's oscillating between these two values, and each time 1/x passes through an integer multiple of \u03c0, it crosses zero. Therefore, the number of zeros is equal to the number of integers n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) lies in (0.0001, 0.001), which we found to be 2865. Wait, but let me make sure that I didn't miss any edge cases. For example, could there be any n where 1/(n\u03c0) equals exactly 0.0001 or 0.001? Let's see: If 1/(n\u03c0) = 0.0001, then n = 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, there's no integer n such that 1/(n\u03c0) = 0.0001 exactly, because 3183.098 is not an integer. Similarly, for 0.001: 1/(n\u03c0) = 0.001 implies n = 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309, which is also not an integer. Therefore, none of the x-intercepts coincide exactly with the endpoints, so all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive give x in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the total number is 2865. So, I think that's the answer. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning, so I'm confident that the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\). This occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for some integer \\( n \\), which implies \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n\nWe need \\( x \\) to be within the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\). Therefore, we solve the inequalities:\n\\[ 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\]\n\nRewriting these inequalities to solve for \\( n \\):\n1. \\( 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\) implies \\( n < \\frac{1}{0.0001\\pi} \\approx 3183.098 \\)\n2. \\( \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\) implies \\( n > \\frac{1}{0.001\\pi} \\approx 318.309 \\)\n\nThus, \\( n \\) must be an integer such that \\( 319 \\leq n \\leq 3183 \\).\n\nThe number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is calculated as:\n\\[ 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is \\(\\boxed{2865}\\)."

So, each n corresponds to exactly one x in the interval, and we've correctly counted all such n from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

So, 0.0001000031 is just barely above 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001).

Therefore, n=319 gives x\u22480.0009978, which is within (0.0001, 0.001), and n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001000031, which is just above 0.0001, so also included. Therefore, the total number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me think again: when n increases, x decreases, so the x-values are getting closer to zero as n increases. So, the function y = sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly as x approaches zero. Each time 1/x passes through an integer multiple of \u03c0, the function crosses the x-axis. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is quite close to zero, the function oscillates very rapidly. Each oscillation corresponds to a pair of intercepts (positive and negative), but since we're only counting where it crosses zero, each zero crossing is at x = 1/(n\u03c0). Therefore, each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept. So, the number of x-intercepts is equal to the number of integers n for which x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in (0.0001, 0.001). As we've calculated, that's n from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which gives 2865 intercepts. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation of 3183 - 319 +1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, 2864 +1 = 2865. So, that's correct. Alternatively, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a +1. So, 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me consider a smaller interval to see if the approach works. Suppose I take the interval (0.1, 0.2). Then, x = 1/(n\u03c0) must be between 0.1 and 0.2. So, 0.1 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.2. Solving for n: 1/(0.2\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.1\u03c0). Calculating: 1/(0.2\u03c0) \u2248 1/(0.6283) \u2248 1.5915. 1/(0.1\u03c0) \u2248 1/(0.3142) \u2248 3.1831. So, n must be greater than 1.5915 and less than 3.1831. Therefore, n = 2,3. So, number of x-intercepts is 2. Let's check: x = 1/(2\u03c0) \u2248 0.15915, which is between 0.1 and 0.2. x = 1/(3\u03c0) \u2248 0.1061, which is also between 0.1 and 0.2. x = 1/(4\u03c0) \u2248 0.0796, which is less than 0.1, so not included. So, n=2 and n=3, which gives 2 intercepts. Using the formula: n starts at 2 and ends at 3, so 3 - 2 +1 = 2. Correct. So, the formula works in this smaller case. Therefore, applying the same logic, in the original problem, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

Therefore, the count is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, I think that's the answer. But let me just think again: sometimes when dealing with open intervals, we have to be careful about whether the endpoints are included, but in this case, since the x-intercepts occur at x=1/(n\u03c0), and n is integer, and the x values are strictly between 0.0001 and 0.001, so we don't include the endpoints, but since n=319 and n=3183 give x just inside the interval, they are included. Therefore, the total number is 2865. I think that's the correct number of x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 3183 - 319 again. 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then minus 19 more is 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive as follows: the number of integers from 1 to 3183 is 3183, and from 1 to 318 is 318, so subtracting, we get 3183 - 318 = 2865. Wait, that's a different approach but arrives at the same answer. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is to consider how many times sin(1/x) crosses the x-axis between x=0.0001 and x=0.001. Each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, sin(1/x) completes a full cycle, crossing zero twice each cycle (once going up, once going down). But wait, actually, sin(\u03b8) crosses zero once every \u03c0 interval, not twice. Wait, no, sin(\u03b8) is zero at \u03b8=0, \u03c0, 2\u03c0, etc., so each zero crossing is at intervals of \u03c0. So, the number of zero crossings between \u03b8=a and \u03b8=b is approximately (b - a)/\u03c0. But in our case, \u03b8=1/x, so as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, \u03b8 decreases from 10000 to 1000. So, \u03b8 goes from 10000 to 1000, which is a decrease of 9000. So, the number of zero crossings would be approximately (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 = 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866. But wait, that's close to our previous answer of 2865. Hmm, why the slight difference? Because when \u03b8 decreases from 10000 to 1000, the number of times sin(\u03b8) crosses zero is floor(10000/\u03c0) - floor(1000/\u03c0). Let's compute 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, and 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, floor(3183.098) = 3183, and floor(318.309) = 318. So, the number of zero crossings is 3183 - 318 = 2865, which matches our earlier result. So, that's another way to think about it, and it confirms that the number is 2865.\n\nWait, but in my initial approach, I considered n starting at 319, which is floor(1000/\u03c0) + 1, right? Because 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so the next integer is 319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so the integer part is 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, that's consistent with the other approach.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).
