    "text": " \u03c0 \u2248 3.1415926535. So, 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796. Then, 183\u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 183 * 3 = 549, 183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 183 * 0.1 = 18.3, 183 * 0.0415926535 \u2248 7.577. So, total \u2248 549 + 18.3 + 7.577 \u2248 574.877. So, total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796 + 574.877 \u2248 9999.655. Therefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.655 \u2248 0.0001000034, which is indeed just slightly above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, for n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535. Let's compute 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477796, 19\u03c0 \u2248 59.69026042. So, total \u2248 942.477796 + 59.69026042 \u2248 1002.168056. So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.168056 \u2248 0.00099783, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval. Therefore, both n=319 and n=3183 give x within the interval, so they are both included. Therefore, the total number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me just make sure that I didn't make a miscalculation when subtracting 3183 - 319. Let me compute 3183 - 319. 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, that's correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. So, the final answer is 2865.\n\nWait, but hold on a second, I just thought of something. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times as x approaches 0. But in our case, we're only looking at x between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a very small interval near zero. So, the function will oscillate rapidly as x approaches zero, but in this interval, each oscillation corresponds to one x-intercept, right? Wait, but actually, each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the sine function completes a half-period, so the number of zeros should correspond to how many times 1/x passes through multiples of \u03c0 in that interval.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should think of it as the number of times 1/x crosses multiples of \u03c0 as x moves from 0.001 to 0.0001. Let me see: when x is 0.001, 1/x is 1000. When x is 0.0001, 1/x is 10000. So, 1/x moves from 1000 to 10000 as x moves from 0.001 to 0.0001. So, the number of times sin(1/x) crosses zero is the number of times 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0 in the interval (1000, 10000). So, the number of zeros would be the number of integers n such that n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating those: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is the number of times 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0 in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001, 1/x increases from 1000 to 10000. Each time 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0, the sine function crosses zero. So, the number of crossings is equal to the number of multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000, which is the same as the number of integers n where n\u03c0 is in (1000, 10000). So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which is the same as n between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.309 to 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, giving 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 zeros.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0 more accurately. \u03c0 is approximately 3.141592653589793. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.141592653589793 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, the smallest integer n greater than 318.309886184 is 319, and the largest integer n less than 3183.09886184 is 3183. So, the integers n run from 319 to 3183, inclusive.\n\nNow, to find how many integers are in this range, we can use the formula: number of integers = (last - first) + 1. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 gives 2865. So, that's the number of x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me think about whether this is correct. Each x-intercept corresponds to a unique n, so each n from 319 to 3183 gives a unique x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, yes, the count should be 2865.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to compute the difference between 10000/\u03c0 and 1000/\u03c0, and then take the floor and ceiling appropriately. The number of zeros is the number of n where n\u03c0 is in (1000, 10000). So, the number of such n is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0) + 1. Calculating that: floor(10000/\u03c0) = floor(3183.09886184) = 3183. ceil(1000/\u03c0) = ceil(318.309886184) = 319. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that's another way to get the same result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

So, total 565.486677 + 9.42477796 \u2248 574.911455. So, total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796 + 574.911455 \u2248 9999.689415. Therefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.689415 \u2248 0.000100003125. So, yes, it's approximately 0.000100003125, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, for n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477796, 19\u03c0 \u2248 59.6902604. So, total \u2248 942.477796 + 59.6902604 \u2248 1002.168056. Therefore, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.168056 \u2248 0.00099785, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, both n=319 and n=3183 give x values within the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the count from n=319 to n=3183 inclusive is correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me make sure that 3183 - 319 is indeed 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but I just thought of something else. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0, right? So, between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a very small interval near zero, the function oscillates rapidly. Each oscillation corresponds to a period of 2\u03c0 in the argument of the sine function. Since the argument is 1/x, each period corresponds to a change in x by \u0394x = 1/(n\u03c0) - 1/((n+1)\u03c0) \u2248 1/(n^2 \u03c0) for large n. But perhaps that's complicating things. Alternatively, the number of zeros between a and b for sin(1/x) is approximately the number of times 1/x passes through multiples of \u03c0 as x goes from a to b. So, the number of zeros is roughly (1/(a\u03c0) - 1/(b\u03c0)) / 1, but since it's discrete, it's the integer values between 1/(b\u03c0) and 1/(a\u03c0). So, in this case, a = 0.0001, b = 0.001, so 1/a = 10000, 1/b = 1000. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which is from approximately 318.31 to 3183.098, which is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865, which matches our earlier calculation. So, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3183 - 319. Let's compute 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. Yes, that's correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that each time x decreases by \u0394x, the argument 1/x increases by \u0394(1/x) = -\u0394x / x^2. So, the change in the argument is negative because x is decreasing. The number of zeros would be approximately the total change in the argument divided by \u03c0, since each zero occurs every \u03c0 units. So, the total change in 1/x from x=0.001 to x=0.0001 is 1/0.0001 - 1/0.001 = 10000 - 1000 = 9000. So, the number of zeros would be approximately 9000 / \u03c0 \u2248 2866. But wait, that's slightly different from 2865. Hmm, but why is there a discrepancy? Because when we count the number of integers between 318.31 and 3183.098, it's 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865, but the approximation gives 2866. So, which one is correct? Let me think.\n\nWait, the exact count is 2865, and the approximation is 2866, which is close. The difference is because the approximation is a continuous measure, while the actual count is discrete. So, the exact count is 2865, which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approximation. Let me see: The total change in 1/x is 10000 - 1000 = 9000. The number of zeros is the number of times 1/x crosses multiples of \u03c0, so the number of zeros is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0). Let's compute floor(10000/\u03c0) = floor(3183.0988618) = 3183. ceil(1000/\u03c0) = ceil(318.30988618) = 319. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864. Then, the number of zeros is 2864, but wait, that's different from our earlier count. Wait, but earlier we had 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, which is correct? Let me think.\n\nThe number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a +1. So, if a is 319 and b is 3183, the count is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. But if we compute floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0) +1, that would be 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, that's consistent. So, the approximation was slightly off because it didn't account for the +1 in the count. So, the exact number is 2865.\n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I'm confident that the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

Therefore, the count is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Wait, but let me think again: when I subtract 3183 - 319, I get 2864, then adding 1 gives 2865. So, that's the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. So, I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me consider the function y = sin(1/x). As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. So, between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a small interval near zero, the function oscillates a lot, crossing the x-axis each time 1/x increases by \u03c0. So, the number of zeros should be roughly proportional to the length of the interval in terms of 1/x. Let me see: The interval for x is from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is a factor of 10 in x. But in terms of 1/x, it's from 10000 to 100000. So, the length in terms of 1/x is 90000. Each zero occurs every \u03c0 units in 1/x. So, the number of zeros should be approximately 90000 / \u03c0, which is about 28662. Wait, that's way higher than 2865. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, so where did I go wrong? Because my initial approach gave me 2865, but this estimation suggests it's about 28,662. There's a discrepancy here. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the interval. Let me clarify: The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is from x = 0.0001 to x = 0.001. So, in terms of 1/x, that's from 10000 to 100000. So, the range of 1/x is from 10^4 to 10^5. So, the total change in 1/x is 9*10^4. Since each zero occurs every \u03c0 units in 1/x, the number of zeros should be approximately (\u0394(1/x))/\u03c0 = (10^5 - 10^4)/\u03c0 = 9*10^4 / \u03c0 \u2248 28662. So, that's about 28,662 zeros. But according to my earlier calculation, I got 2865. There's a factor of 10 difference. Wait, so where did I go wrong? Let me check my initial approach. I set x = 1/(n\u03c0), so n = 1/(x\u03c0). Then, for x in (0.0001, 0.001), n must satisfy 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0). So, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, which is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. But according to the estimation, it should be around 28,662. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial approach. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think: Each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, sin(1/x) completes a half-period, so it crosses zero once. Therefore, the number of zeros should be approximately the change in 1/x divided by \u03c0. So, that's (100000 - 10000)/\u03c0 \u2248 90000/\u03c0 \u2248 28662. So, that's about 28,662 zeros. But according to my earlier method, I got 2865. So, I'm off by a factor of 10. Wait, why is that? Let me check my initial calculation again. I had 0.0001 < x < 0.001, so 1/(n\u03c0) must be in that interval. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, solving for n: 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0), which is 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, which is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Wait, but according to the estimation, it's 28,662. So, I'm missing something here. Let me consider that between 1/(n\u03c0) and 1/((n+1)\u03c0), there is one zero crossing. So, the number of zeros is the number of n's such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but that's what I did earlier, leading to 2865. But the estimation suggests it's about 28,662. So, where is the mistake? Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the number of times 1/x crosses multiples of \u03c0. Let me think differently: Let\u2019s consider t = 1/x. Then, as x goes from 0.0001 to 0.001, t goes from 10000 to 100000. So, t increases from 10^4 to 10^5. The function becomes y = sin(t). The zeros of sin(t) occur at t = k\u03c0, where k is an integer. So, the number of zeros in t \u2208 (10^4, 10^5) is the number of integers k such that 10^4 < k\u03c0 < 10^5. So, solving for k: k > 10^4 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.098 and k < 10^5 / \u03c0 \u2248 31830.988. So, k ranges from 3184 to 31830 inclusive. The number of integers from 3184 to 31830 is 31830 - 3184 +1 = 28647. So, approximately 28,647 zeros. That makes sense with the earlier estimation of about 28,662. So, why did my initial approach give me 2865? Because I was considering x = 1/(n\u03c0), but in reality, t = 1/x = n\u03c0, so n = t/\u03c0. Therefore, when t ranges from 10^4 to 10^5, n ranges from 10^4/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098 to 10^5/\u03c0 \u2248 31830.988. So, n starts at 3184 and ends at 31830, giving 31830 - 3184 +1 = 28647 zeros. Therefore, my initial approach was incorrect because I confused the variable substitution. I thought x = 1/(n\u03c0), but in reality, t = 1/x = n\u03c0, so n = t/\u03c0. Therefore, the correct number of zeros is 28,647, which is about 28,662 as estimated. So, where did I go wrong earlier? I think I misapplied the substitution. I set x = 1/(n\u03c0), but in reality, t = 1/x = n\u03c0, so n = t/\u03c0, which leads to a much larger range for n, hence more zeros. Therefore, the correct number of zeros is approximately 28,647. Wait, but let me confirm this with precise calculation. The interval for t is (10000, 100000). The first zero after t=10000 is at t = ceil(10000/\u03c0) * \u03c0. Let's compute 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so the next integer is 3184, so the first zero is at t = 3184\u03c0 \u2248 3184 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 184\u03c0 \u2248 577.9999, so total \u2248 9424.77796 + 577.9999 \u2248 10002.77786. So, the first zero is at t \u2248 10002.77786, which is just above 10000. Similarly, the last zero before t=100000 is at t = floor(100000/\u03c0) * \u03c0. 100000/\u03c0 \u2248 31830.988, so floor is 31830, so t = 31830\u03c0 \u2248 31830 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 30000\u03c0 \u2248 94247.7796, 1830\u03c0 \u2248 5748.996, so total \u2248 94247.7796 + 5748.996 \u2248 99996.7756. So, the last zero is at t \u2248 99996.7756, which is just below 100000. Now, the number of zeros is the number of integers k such that 3184 \u2264 k \u2264 31830. So, the number is 31830 - 3184 +1 = 28647. Therefore, the number of zeros is 28,647. So, my initial approach was incorrect because I misapplied the substitution. I thought x = 1/(n\u03c0), leading to n from 319 to 3183, but actually, t = 1/x = n\u03c0, leading to n from 3184 to 31830, giving a much larger number of zeros. Therefore, the correct number of x-intercepts is 28,647. But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing any zeros near the endpoints. For example, the first zero after t=10000 is at t\u224810002.77786, which is within the interval, and the last zero before t=100000 is at t\u224899996.7756, also within the interval. So, all zeros from k=3184 to k=31830 are included, giving 28,647 zeros. Therefore, the correct answer is 28,647. But wait, let me check with exact values. Let me compute 10000/\u03c0 and 100000/\u03c0 more accurately. 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so the next integer is 3184. 100000/\u03c0 \u2248 31830.9886184, so the floor is 31830. So, the number of integers from 3184 to 31830 inclusive is 31830 - 3184 +1 = 28647. So, that's the exact count. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 28,647. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by not considering the correct substitution and misapplying the variable change. The correct number is much higher, around 28,647. Therefore, the final answer is 28,647.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0).

Therefore, n=319 and n=3183 both give x-values within the interval, so they are included. Therefore, the total number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me just make sure that n=3183 is indeed the last n where x is just above 0.0001. Let me check n=3184: x=1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3184*3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10002.4) \u2248 0.000099976, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. Therefore, n=3183 is the largest integer where x is still greater than 0.0001. Similarly, n=318 gives x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.0) = 0.001, but since our interval is open, 0.001 is excluded, so n=318 would give x=0.001, which is not included. Therefore, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. Therefore, the count from n=319 to n=3183 inclusive is correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me think again: is each n giving a unique x-intercept? Yes, because for each integer n, x=1/(n\u03c0) is a distinct point where sin(1/x) crosses zero. So, each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept in the interval. Therefore, the total number is 2865. I think that's the answer. But just to recap, the steps were: 1. Recognize that sin(1/x)=0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so x=1/(n\u03c0). 2. Determine the range of x where 0.0001 < x < 0.001. 3. Substitute x=1/(n\u03c0) into the inequality to find the range of n. 4. Solve for n to find the lower and upper bounds. 5. Count the number of integers between these bounds, inclusive. 6. Ensure that the endpoints are correctly included or excluded based on the interval being open or closed. In this case, the interval is open, but since the x-values corresponding to n=319 and n=3183 are just inside the interval, they are included. Therefore, the total number is 2865. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). For x in (0.0001, 0.001), we find n must satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

Since n must be an integer, the smallest integer greater than 3183.098 is 3184. So, n=3184 is the first integer where n\u03c0\u22483184*\u03c0\u224810000.000000something? Wait, but from the calculation above, 3184\u03c0\u22489999.81296, which is still less than 10000. Hmm, so maybe n=3184\u03c0\u22489999.81296, which is less than 10000, so 1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0001000018, which is greater than 0.0001. So, n=3184 is included.

So, n=3185 is included. Wait, but then when does n\u03c0 reach exactly 10000? It would be at n=10000/\u03c0\u22483183.098, but since n must be an integer, the next integer is 3184, but as we saw, n=3184\u03c0\u22489999.81296, which is still less than 10000, so 1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0001000018, which is greater than 0.0001. So, n=3184 is included. Similarly, n=3183\u03c0\u22489999.71296, which is less than 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001000028, which is included. Wait, but then n=3183 is included, n=3184 is included, and so on, up to n=3183. Wait, but that can't be right because n=3183 is the lower bound. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Therefore, the count is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Wait, but let me make sure that n=319 is the first n where x < 0.001. Let me check n=318: x=1/(318\u03c0). Compute 318\u03c0 \u2248 318 * 3.1416 \u2248 318*3=954, 318*0.1416\u224845. So, total \u2248 954 + 45 = 999. So, x=1/999\u22480.001001, which is just above 0.001, so it's outside the interval. Therefore, n=318 gives x\u22480.001001, which is greater than 0.001, so it's excluded. So, the first n that gives x < 0.001 is n=319, as we thought earlier. Similarly, n=3183 gives x\u22480.00010000314, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. If we check n=3184, x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22481/(3184*3.1416)\u22481/(10001.0)\u22480.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, n=3183 is the last n that gives x just above 0.0001. Therefore, our range for n is correct: from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Wait, but let me compute 3183 - 319 again to make sure. 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again: each time n increases by 1, x decreases by a certain amount, and each x corresponds to a unique zero crossing. Since sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely as x approaches 0, but in our case, x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a finite interval, so the number of zeros should be finite, which it is, 2865. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\). This occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for some integer \\( n \\), which implies \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n\nWe need \\( x \\) to satisfy \\( 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\). Solving these inequalities for \\( n \\):\n\n1. From \\( 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\):\n   \\[\n   n < \\frac{1}{0.0001\\pi} \\approx \\frac{10000}{\\pi} \\approx 3183.098\n   \\]\n\n2.

The number of integers in this range is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts is \\(\\boxed{2865}\\)."

So, 18.3 + 7.32 = 25.62 + 0.292 \u2248 25.912. So, total 549 + 25.912 \u2248 574.912. So, 3000\u03c0 + 183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796 + 574.912 \u2248 9999.69. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.69. Therefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.69 \u2248 0.000100003. So, that's just barely above 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 1003.5, so 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Therefore, n=319 gives x=0.0009965, which is within the interval, and n=3183 gives x\u22480.000100003, which is also within the interval. Therefore, all integers n from 319 to 3183 inclusive are valid, so the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Wait, but let me just confirm that 3183 - 319 is indeed 2864. 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 -19=2864. Yes, so 2864 +1=2865. So, the answer should be 2865 x-intercepts. But wait, let me think again: is there a possibility that some n's might result in x outside the interval? For example, if n=319, x\u22480.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so it's good. If n=3183, x\u22480.000100003, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's good. So, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive result in x in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the number of terms. So, from n=319 to n=3183, how many integers? The formula is (last - first) +1. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. That seems correct. Alternatively, think of it as starting at 319, then each subsequent integer up to 3183. So, the count is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: the number of integers between a and b inclusive is b - a +1. So, here, a=319, b=3183. So, 3183 -319 +1 = 2865. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about how many integers are less than or equal to 3183 and greater than or equal to 319, it's 3183 - 319 +1.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3183 - 319:\n\n3183 - 300 = 2883\n\n2883 - 19 = 2864\n\nSo, 2864, plus 1 is 2865.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is there a possibility that for some n, x=1/(n\u03c0) might not lie in (0.0001, 0.001)? For example, if n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22481/(1000.0)\u22480.001, but since our interval is open at 0.001, x=0.001 is excluded. So, n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.001003, which is greater than 0.001, so it's excluded. Similarly, n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, n must start at 319 and end at 3183, so that x is within (0.0001, 0.001). So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. The function y=sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. The number of oscillations increases as x approaches 0. The interval we're looking at is from x=0.0001 to x=0.001. So, the function completes a cycle every 2\u03c0/(1/x) change in x, but maybe it's better to think in terms of how many times 1/x passes through multiples of \u03c0 as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001.\n\nWait, perhaps another way: Let me consider that as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000. So, 1/x goes from 10000 down to 1000. The sine function is zero whenever its argument is an integer multiple of \u03c0. So, the zeros occur at 1/x = n\u03c0, where n is an integer. So, x = 1/(n\u03c0). Now, we need 0.0001 < x < 0.001, which translates to 1000 < 1/x < 10000. So, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. Therefore, n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n must be between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0. Calculating those:\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.309\n\n10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1416 \u2248 3183.098\n\nSo, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, as before. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nWait, that's the same result as before, so that's a good consistency check.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it multiple ways, and all approaches lead to the same answer. So, I'm confident that the number of x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

Similarly, n=318: x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.77) \u2248 0.00099923, which is just below 0.001, but wait, 0.00099923 is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval. Wait, but earlier I thought n starts at 319. Let me check n=318: x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.77) \u2248 0.00099923, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. But wait, earlier I had n > 318.309, so n starts at 319. But n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099923, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Wait, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than approximately 318.309, so n=319 is the first integer. So, n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099923, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Wait, but according to the initial inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=319 is the first integer. So, n=318 is less than 318.309, so it's not included. Therefore, n starts at 319, giving x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, the count from n=319 to n=3183 is correct as 2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). To find the number of such x in (0.0001, 0.001), we solve for n:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001  \n\u21d2 318.309 < n < 3183.098  \n\nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is:\n\n3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

    "text": " \u03c0 \u2248 3.1415926535. So, 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let's compute 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 183 * 3 = 549, 183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 25.933, so total \u2248 549 + 25.933 \u2248 574.933. So, total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796 + 574.933 \u2248 9999.71096. Therefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.71096 \u2248 0.0001000028. So, it's just a bit above 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 is valid. Similarly, n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 1003.5. So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so it's included as well. Therefore, the count from n=319 to n=3183 inclusive is correct, giving 2865 x-intercepts. But wait, let me just confirm the subtraction again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 is 2865. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me think about whether each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept. Since sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely as x approaches 0, but in our case, we're only looking between 0.0001 and 0.001. Each time n increases by 1, x decreases by a small amount, and each x corresponds to a unique zero crossing. So, each n in that range gives exactly one x-intercept in the interval. Therefore, the total number is 2865. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial setup. The function is y = sin(1/x). The zeros occur when 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n: 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0). Calculating 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be integers strictly greater than 318.309 and strictly less than 3183.098. Therefore, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is: the number of zeros is the number of times the sine function completes a full cycle as x moves from 0.001 to 0.0001. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more rapidly as x approaches 0. The number of zeros can also be approximated by the difference in the arguments of the sine function at the endpoints. Let me see: when x = 0.001, 1/x = 1000. When x = 0.0001, 1/x = 10000. So, the sine function goes from 1000 to 10000 radians. The number of zeros in this interval would be approximately the difference between these two values divided by \u03c0, since each zero occurs every \u03c0 radians. So, the number of zeros is (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 \u2248 9000/3.1416 \u2248 2866. But wait, that's very close to 2865, which I got earlier. The slight difference is because the exact count is the integer part, so perhaps this approximation is slightly off due to the endpoints. But since my exact calculation gave 2865, and this approximation is 2866, it's likely that 2865 is the correct answer. Alternatively, the exact number is floor(10000/\u03c0) - floor(1000/\u03c0). Let me compute floor(10000/\u03c0) and floor(1000/\u03c0). 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so floor is 3183. 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so floor is 318. Then, the number of zeros is 3183 - 318 = 2865. That's exactly what I got before. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think again: the zeros occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0), so for x in (0.0001, 0.001), n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so n must be between 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, another thought: sometimes when dealing with open intervals, you have to be careful if the endpoints themselves are zeros. But in this case, x=0.0001 and x=0.001 are not zeros because 1/x at those points would be 10000 and 1000, respectively, which are not integer multiples of \u03c0. So, the open interval doesn't include those points, but the zeros near them are still included because x approaches them from within the interval. Therefore, the count remains 2865.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).
