    "text": " For 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. For 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. So, n must be an integer from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, that seems correct. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But wait, let me think again. Is there any possibility that the endpoints themselves are included? The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, meaning it doesn't include the endpoints. So, x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001, but only values in between. So, when I calculated n > 318.309 and n < 3183.098, that means n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, which is correct because x = 1/(319\u03c0) is less than 0.001, and x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. So, all these x-values are strictly inside the interval (0.0001, 0.001), so we don't have to worry about endpoints. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is indeed 2865. Hmm, that seems like a lot. Let me see: the interval from 0.0001 to 0.001 is 0.0009 in length. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly as x approaches 0. So, in this interval, which is very close to zero, the function oscillates a huge number of times. Each oscillation corresponds to a peak and a trough, and each time it crosses the x-axis twice per period, except possibly at the endpoints. But since the interval is open, we don't include the endpoints, so each full period contributes two x-intercepts. Wait, but in my initial approach, I considered each zero crossing, which happens once per half-period. So, maybe I should think in terms of how many times sin(1/x) crosses zero in that interval. Let me try another approach to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, the zeros of sin(1/x) occur at 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, to find the number of such x in (0.0001, 0.001), we can find the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in that interval. Which is the same as n being in (1/(0.001\u03c0), 1/(0.0001\u03c0)). So, n must satisfy 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0). Calculating those:\n\n1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309\n\n1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098\n\nSo, n must be an integer strictly greater than 318.309 and strictly less than 3183.098. Therefore, n can be 319, 320, ..., 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about the function's behavior. As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a finite interval, how many oscillations are there? Each oscillation is a period of 2\u03c0 in the argument of the sine function. So, the number of periods is roughly the change in 1/x over the interval divided by 2\u03c0. Let's compute the change in 1/x from x=0.0001 to x=0.001.\n\nAt x=0.0001, 1/x = 10000.\n\nAt x=0.001, 1/x = 1000.\n\nSo, the change is from 10000 to 1000, which is a decrease of 9000. But the number of periods is the total change divided by 2\u03c0. So, 9000 / (2\u03c0) \u2248 9000 / 6.283 \u2248 1432. So, approximately 1432 periods. Each period has two zeros, so the number of zeros would be approximately 2*1432 \u2248 2864. But wait, that's almost exactly the number I got earlier, 2865. The slight difference is probably due to the approximation. So, this method also suggests that the number of zeros is about 2864 or 2865, which matches my earlier exact calculation. Therefore, I can be confident that the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. This translates to x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to n between approximately 319 and 3183. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

    "text": " For 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than that, so n \u2264 3183. For 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than that, so n \u2265 319. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, but wait a second. Let me think about whether all these n values will give x within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). For example, when n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.2) \u2248 0.0009968, which is just under 0.001, so that's within the interval. When n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) = 0.0001, but wait, the interval is open at 0.0001, so x must be greater than 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since 0.0001 is excluded, we need to make sure that x is greater than 0.0001. So, let's check for n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) = 0.0001, but since 0.0001 is excluded, x must be greater than 0.0001. So, we need to find n such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n can be up to 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is not included in the interval. Therefore, the largest n that gives x > 0.0001 is n = 3182. Because x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000 - \u03c0) \u2248 just over 0.0001. Wait, let me compute that more accurately. Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) = 0.0001 exactly, but since n must be less than 3183.098, the maximum integer n is 3183, but x would be 1/(3183\u03c0) which is exactly 0.0001, which is not in the interval. So, we need to exclude n = 3183. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. Similarly, let's check n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001, so that's fine. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3182. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 gives 2864. Wait, so earlier I thought it was 2865, but now I think it's 2864 because n goes up to 3182. Let me double-check. So, n must satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, solving for n: 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0). Which is approximately 318.309 < n < 3183.098. So, n can be from 319 to 3183, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, n must be less than 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 + a tiny bit, so it's greater than 0.0001. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 = 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, which one is correct? Let me think about how to count the integers between a and b inclusive. The formula is b - a + 1. So, if a = 319 and b = 3182, then the number is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. So, that's correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me check with specific numbers. Let's say n starts at 319 and ends at 3182. So, the number of terms is (3182 - 319) + 1. Let me compute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863. Then, +1 = 2864. So, yes, 2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. But wait, let me think again about whether n = 3183 gives x = 0.0001, which is excluded, so n must be up to 3182. Therefore, the total number is 2864. So, that's the answer. Wait, but let me think about another approach to confirm. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is from 1e-4 to 1e-3, the function sin(1/x) will oscillate between -1 and 1, crossing the x-axis each time 1/x increases by \u03c0. So, the number of zeros is roughly the number of times 1/x can increase by \u03c0 within that interval. Let me compute the difference in 1/x at the endpoints. At x = 0.001, 1/x = 1000. At x = 0.0001, 1/x = 10000. So, the interval for 1/x is (1000, 10000). The length of this interval is 9000. Each zero occurs every \u03c0 units, so the number of zeros is approximately (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 \u2248 9000 / 3.1416 \u2248 2866. But wait, that's an approximation. But our earlier exact calculation gave 2864. Hmm, the approximation is close but not exact. The exact calculation gave 2864, while the approximation is about 2866. The difference is due to the endpoints. Since we're dealing with an open interval (0.0001, 0.001), we have to exclude the endpoints, which affects the count by 1 or 2. So, the exact count is 2864, which is close to the approximation of 2866. So, that makes sense. Therefore, I think 2864 is the correct number of x-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nThe function \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) has x-intercepts where \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for integer \\( n \\), leading to \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).

Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n\u03c0 > 1000 => n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, so the minimum integer n is 319. So, yes, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. But wait, let me think again: when n increases, x decreases because x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, as n goes from 319 to 3183, x goes from approximately 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.00098, which is just below 0.001, down to 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000996, which is just above 0.0001. Wait, hold on, that seems contradictory. If n increases, 1/(n\u03c0) decreases. So, when n=319, x\u22480.00098, which is less than 0.001, and when n=3183, x\u22480.0000996, which is greater than 0.0001. Wait, but 0.0000996 is less than 0.0001. Wait, no, 0.0001 is 1e-4, and 0.0000996 is 9.96e-5, which is less than 1e-4. So, actually, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000996, which is less than 0.0001. But our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. Therefore, x=1/(n\u03c0) must satisfy 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n \u2264 3183. And 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n \u2265 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. But wait, let me compute 3183 - 319. Let's do it step by step: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2865. So, that's correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, is that right? Because each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept, and since n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, each n gives a unique x in the interval. So, the total number is 2865. But let me think again: when n=319, x\u22480.00098, which is less than 0.001, and greater than 0.0001. Similarly, when n=3183, x\u22480.0000996, which is less than 0.0001, but our interval is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001. So, does n=3183 give x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0000996, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, n must be such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which is n < 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.098, so n must be less than that, meaning n can be up to 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0000996<0.0001, so it's excluded. So, actually, n must satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which is n < 3183.098, but also 1/(n\u03c0) <0.001, which is n>318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098. But since n must be an integer, n can be from 319 up to 3183, but we have to check if n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0000996, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. Let me check: 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22481/(3182*3.1416)\u22481/(10000)\u22480.0001, but more accurately, 3182*3.1416\u22483182*3.1416\u22483182*3=9546, 3182*0.1416\u22483182*0.1=318.2, 3182*0.0416\u2248132. So total\u22489546+318.2+132\u22489996.2. So, 1/(9996.2)\u22480.000100038, which is just above 0.0001. So, x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.000100038>0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, n can be 319 up to 3182, inclusive. So, now, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 +1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1=2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, so I think I made a mistake earlier by including n=3183, which gives x below 0.0001, which is excluded. So, the correct upper limit is n=3182. Therefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 +1=2864. Let me confirm: n starts at 319 and ends at 3182. So, the count is (3182 - 319) +1=2864. So, that's the correct number. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. But let me double-check the calculation: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1=2864. Yes. Alternatively, think of it as starting at n=1, the number of terms from 1 to 3182 is 3182, and from 1 to 318 is 318, so the number from 319 to 3182 is 3182 - 318=2864. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0).

So, the number of integers is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but I should consider whether both endpoints are included or not. The interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. So, do I need to check if x=1/(n\u03c0) could be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001? Let's see: 0.0001 = 1/(n\u03c0) \u21d2 n = 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n=3183 would give x\u22481/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00009999, which is just below 0.0001. Similarly, n=319 gives x\u22481/(319\u03c0)\u22480.000997, which is just below 0.001. Wait, no, 0.000997 is 0.000997, which is 0.000997 < 0.001, so it's within the interval. Wait, but 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.14) \u2248 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001. So, yes, it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=3183 gives x\u22481/(3183\u03c0)\u22481/(10000\u03c0)\u22480.0000318, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included in the interval. So, the smallest n where x=1/(n\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001 is n=319, because n=318 would give x\u22481/(318\u03c0)\u22480.000999, which is still less than 0.001, but wait, no: 1/(318\u03c0) is approximately 1/(1000.77)\u22480.000999, which is 0.000999, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Wait, but earlier I thought n starts at 319 because 1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.000997, which is just under 0.001. Wait, no, 0.000997 is less than 0.001, so it's included. Wait, but 0.000997 is 0.000997, which is 0.000997 < 0.001, so it's inside the interval. So, n=319 gives x\u22480.000997, which is in (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=3183 gives x\u22480.0000318, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. So, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, I think that's the correct number. But just to be thorough, let me check with specific values. Let's compute x for n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22481/(1003.14)\u22480.0009968, which is 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. For n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22481/(10000.0003)\u22480.00009999, which is just under 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, n=319 is the first n where x is just under 0.001, and n=3183 is the last n where x is just under 0.0001. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is indeed 2865. So, the final answer is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n gives n between approximately 318.309 and 3183.098. The integers n range from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

And when 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, then n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309, so n must be greater than that. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. But wait, hold on. Let me confirm the exact values. Let me compute 1/(0.0001\u03c0) exactly. 0.0001 is 1e-4, so 1/(1e-4 * \u03c0) = 1e4 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than this, so the largest integer n is 3183. Similarly, 1/(0.001\u03c0) is 1e-3 / \u03c0 \u2248 0.31830988618, so n must be greater than that, so the smallest integer n is 319. Therefore, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, 2865 x-intercepts. But wait, is that correct? Let me think about the function sin(1/x). As x approaches 0 from the positive side, 1/x approaches infinity, and sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a small interval near zero, the function sin(1/x) oscillates rapidly. Each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the sine function completes a half-period, so each x-intercept occurs every \u03c0 in the argument 1/x. So, the distance between consecutive x-intercepts in terms of x is \u0394x = x_{n+1} - x_n = 1/(n\u03c0) - 1/((n+1)\u03c0) = (1/(n\u03c0)) - (1/((n+1)\u03c0)) = (n+1 - n)/(n(n+1)\u03c0) = 1/(n(n+1)\u03c0). As n increases, this \u0394x becomes smaller, which makes sense because the function oscillates more rapidly as x approaches zero. So, the number of x-intercepts should indeed be proportional to the interval length divided by the wavelength, but since the wavelength is decreasing, it's more complicated. However, in this case, we're using the fact that each x-intercept corresponds to n being an integer, so the count is as we found: 2865. But wait, let me make sure that the interval (0.0001, 0.001) includes all x from just above 0.0001 up to just below 0.001. So, the x-intercepts are at x = 1/(n\u03c0), so we need to find all n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Rearranged, as before, n must satisfy 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0), which gives 318.309 < n < 3183.098, so n from 319 to 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but let me compute 3183 - 319. 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2865. So, that seems correct.

Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in that interval. Wait, but let me think again. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0, right? So, between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a very small interval near zero, the function oscillates infinitely many times? Wait, no, because 0.0001 is already a fixed positive number, so between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a finite interval, the number of oscillations is finite. Wait, but in this case, the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is from 0.0001 to 0.001, so as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000. So, 1/x goes from 10000 down to 1000. So, sin(1/x) will oscillate between -1 and 1 as 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000. Each time 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0, sin(1/x) crosses zero. So, the number of zeros is the number of times 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0 in that interval. So, the number of zeros is equal to the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, because when x is 0.001, 1/x is 1000, and when x is 0.0001, 1/x is 10000. Wait, hold on, I think I might have mixed up the direction earlier. Let me clarify: When x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000. So, 1/x starts at 10000 and goes down to 1000. So, the values of \u03b8 = 1/x go from 10000 to 1000. So, sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 = n\u03c0. So, we're looking for all integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, solving for n: 1000 < n\u03c0 \u21d2 n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and n\u03c0 < 10000 \u21d2 n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098.

Hmm, but wait, let me check the exact values of 1/(0.001\u03c0) and 1/(0.0001\u03c0) to make sure I didn't make any rounding errors. Let me compute 1/(0.001\u03c0): 0.001 is 10^-3, so 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0. \u03c0 \u2248 3.1415926535, so 1000/3.1415926535 \u2248 318.3098861.

So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 = 2865. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me think about whether each n in that range corresponds to exactly one x-intercept. Since sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches zero, and each time 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0, the function crosses zero. So, each n corresponds to exactly one x in (0.0001, 0.001), right? So, each integer n from 319 to 3183 gives exactly one x-intercept in that interval. Therefore, the total number is 2865. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure that when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) is indeed greater than 0.0001, and when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.001. Let me compute 1/(319\u03c0): 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 1004. So, 1/1004 \u2248 0.000996, which is greater than 0.0001. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 1/(319\u03c0) is approximately 1/(1004) \u2248 0.000996, which is greater than 0.0001, so x=0.000996 is indeed within (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183*3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound. Wait, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is actually slightly less than 0.0001 because 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000. Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0: 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's compute 3000*3.1416=9424.8, 183*3.1416\u2248575.05, so total \u22489424.8 + 575.05 \u224810,000. So, 3183\u03c0\u224810,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001. But since 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10,000, 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001. Wait, but our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, does x=1/(3183\u03c0) lie within the interval? Since 1/(3183\u03c0) \u22480.0001, which is the lower bound, but the interval is open, so 0.0001 is excluded. Therefore, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but since it's less than 0.0001, it's not included in the interval. So, does that mean that n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the upper bound for n should be 3182 instead of 3183. Wait, let me check that again. If n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0). Since 3183\u03c0\u224810,000, x\u22480.0001. But since 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10,000, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001, which is outside the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, the largest n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3182. Let me compute 1/(3182\u03c0). 3182\u03c0\u22483182*3.1416\u22483182*3=9546, 3182*0.1416\u2248450. So, total\u22489546+450\u22489996. So, 1/(9996)\u22480.00010004, which is just above 0.0001. So, x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.00010004, which is within the interval. So, n=3182 gives x\u22480.00010004, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, n should go up to 3182, not 3183. So, that changes the count. So, the range of n is from 319 to 3182, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 +1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 = 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but now I'm getting 2864. So, I need to figure out which one is correct. Let me re-examine the initial inequalities. We have 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, n must satisfy 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0). So, n must be greater than 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248318.3098861 and less than 1/(0.0001\u03c0)\u22483183.098861. So, n can be integers from 319 up to 3183, but wait, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.00010004>0.0001. So, n goes from 319 to 3182. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 +1. Let me compute that again: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, the correct number is 2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but let me check with n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0). Let me compute 3182 * \u03c0 \u22483182 *3.1415926535. Let's compute 3000\u03c0\u22489424.77796, 182\u03c0\u2248571.7859. So, total\u22489424.77796 +571.7859\u22489996.56386. So, 1/(9996.56386)\u22480.000100034. So, that's approximately 0.000100034, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. So, n=3182 is included. Now, n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0). Let's compute 3183\u03c0\u22483183*3.1415926535. 3000\u03c0\u22489424.77796, 183\u03c0\u2248575.058. So, total\u22489424.77796 +575.058\u224810,000. So, 1/(10,000)=0.0001 exactly. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.0001, x=0.0001 is not included. Therefore, n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. So, the maximum n is 3182. Therefore, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864. So, the answer should be 2864. But wait, let me think again: sometimes when we have inequalities like a < n < b, the number of integers is floor(b) - ceil(a). So, in this case, a=318.3098861, so ceil(a)=319. b=3183.098861, so floor(b)=3183. But since x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, we have to exclude n=3183, so the upper bound is 3182. Therefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 +1=2864. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) has x-intercepts where \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\), which occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for integer \\( n \\).

So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but let me think again: when n increases, x decreases because x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, as n goes from 319 to 3183, x goes from approximately 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1000 \u2248 0.001 down to 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10000 \u2248 0.0001. So, each n corresponds to a unique x in the interval. Therefore, each n from 319 to 3183 gives a valid x-intercept in (0.0001, 0.001). So, the total number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me check the calculation again because 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, sometimes when dealing with ranges, people might think of it as from n=1 to n=3183, which would be 3183 terms, but since we start at n=319, it's 3183 - 318 = 2865. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think: the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, from 319 to 3183, it's 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Yes, that's correct. So, I think the answer is 2865 x-intercepts. But just to make sure, let me consider the function y = sin(1/x). As x approaches 0 from the positive side, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates increasingly rapidly. So, between x=0.0001 and x=0.001, which is a span of 0.0009, the function sin(1/x) will oscillate many times, crossing the x-axis each time 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0. So, the number of zeros should be roughly the number of times 1/x passes through n\u03c0 in that interval. So, 1/x goes from 1000 to 10000 as x goes from 0.001 to 0.0001. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000. So, n must be between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.309 to 3183.098, as I found earlier. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, which gives 2865 integers.

The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches zero because 1/x becomes very large. So, in the interval from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is very close to zero, the function should oscillate rapidly, crossing the x-axis many times.

    "text": " when 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, that implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so n must be less than that. And when 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, that implies n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309, so n must be greater than that. So, n is from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the count is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but let me make sure that 1/(318\u03c0) is less than 0.001 and 1/(319\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001? Let me compute 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(318*3.1416) \u2248 1/(1000) \u2248 0.001, but actually, 318*3.1416 \u2248 1000. So, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.001 exactly. But since x must be less than 0.001, n must be greater than 318.309, so n starts at 319. Similarly, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183*3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, n must be less than 3183.098, so n goes up to 3183. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865.

So, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me think again: does each integer n in that range correspond to exactly one x-intercept? Yes, because for each integer n, there's exactly one x = 1/(n\u03c0) in the interval, and each such x is unique. So, each n gives a distinct x-intercept. Therefore, the total number is 2865. But wait, I should confirm that 1/(319\u03c0) is indeed greater than 0.0001 and 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.001. Let me compute 1/(319\u03c0): 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 1002. So, 1/1002 \u2248 0.000998, which is approximately 0.001, but actually, 0.000998 is just under 0.001. Wait, that's a problem. Because 1/(n\u03c0) needs to be less than 0.001, but if n=319, then 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000998, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Similarly, for the lower bound: n=3183, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/10000 \u2248 0.0001, but actually, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so does x have to be strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001? So, x must satisfy 0.0001 < x < 0.001, which means 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, for n=3183, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but it's equal to 0.0001 exactly? Wait, no, because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but it's slightly less than 0.0001 because 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000. Wait, no, let me compute 3183 * \u03c0: \u03c0 \u2248 3.14159265, so 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265. Let me compute that:\n\n3183 * 3 = 9549\n\n3183 * 0.14159265 \u2248 3183 * 0.1416 \u2248 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, 3183 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0928. Adding those together: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.0928 \u2248 450.7128. So total is approximately 9549 + 450.7128 \u2248 9999.7128. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.7128, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.7128 \u2248 0.0001000028, which is just over 0.0001. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000028, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, for n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 1002. So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000998, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, both n=319 and n=3183 give x values within the interval. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is indeed 2865. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't include n=3183. Because 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000028, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n=3183 is included. Similarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.000998, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Therefore, the count from n=319 to n=3183 inclusive is correct, giving 2865 x-intercepts. So, I think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, let me consider whether there's any overlap or if I missed any edge cases. For example, does n=319 give x=1/(319\u03c0) which is approximately 0.000998, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Similarly, n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001000028, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, all integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive are valid, giving 2865 x-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 1/(n\u03c0) in that interval. Solving for n, we find n ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 integer values.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, that seems like a lot of intercepts, but considering the function sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely as x approaches zero, and the interval is quite close to zero, it makes sense that there are many intercepts. Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, I could consider the behavior of the function. As x approaches zero from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates between -1 and 1 infinitely many times. Each oscillation corresponds to a period of 2\u03c0 in the argument of the sine function. So, each time 1/x increases by 2\u03c0, the sine function completes a full cycle. Therefore, the number of zeros (x-intercepts) in the interval (a, b) can be approximated by the number of times 1/x passes through multiples of \u03c0 as x moves from b to a. Wait, actually, from a to b, since a is smaller than b. Wait, no, x is increasing from a to b, so 1/x is decreasing. So, as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000. So, the argument of the sine function goes from 10000 to 1000. Each time the argument decreases by \u03c0, the sine function crosses zero. So, the number of zeros would be roughly the number of times \u03c0 fits into the interval from 1000 to 10000. Wait, but actually, it's from 10000 to 1000, so the total change is 10000 - 1000 = 9000. So, the number of zeros would be approximately 9000 / \u03c0, which is about 9000 / 3.1416 \u2248 2866. Hmm, that's close to the 2865 I calculated earlier. The slight difference is because 9000 / \u03c0 is approximately 2866.226, so when we take the integer part, it's 2866, but my initial calculation was 2865. There's a discrepancy here. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me check again. The number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001). So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which leads to n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2865. So, that's correct. But when I did the alternative approach, I got approximately 2866.226, which is about 2866. So, why the difference? I think it's because when I compute the total change in the argument, 1/x goes from 10000 to 1000, which is a decrease of 9000, and each zero crossing occurs every \u03c0 units. So, the number of crossings would be approximately 9000 / \u03c0 \u2248 2866.226. But since n must be integers, the exact number is 2865. The difference is due to the fact that the first n is 319, which corresponds to 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000987, which is just below 0.001, and the last n is 3183, which corresponds to 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999, which is just above 0.0001. So, the exact count is 2865, while the approximation gives 2866.226, which is close but slightly higher. So, the exact number is 2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n gives 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but let me make sure that 1/(n\u03c0) is indeed within the interval for n=319 and n=3183. Let's compute x when n=319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.08) \u2248 0.000997, which is just under 0.001, so it's within the interval. Similarly, for n=3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.00) = 0.0001, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), it's an open interval, so x=0.0001 is excluded. Wait, so does that mean n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) which is approximately 0.0001, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001. So, is 1/(3183\u03c0) greater than 0.0001?

So, total 9549 + 450.7 \u2248 9999.7. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.7, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.7 \u2248 0.000100003. So, it's just a tiny bit above 0.0001, so x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100003, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval.

As x approaches zero from the positive side, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates increasingly rapidly between -1 and 1. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is very close to zero, the function will oscillate very rapidly. Each oscillation corresponds to a period of 2\u03c0 in \u03b8, but since \u03b8 = 1/x, the x-distance between two consecutive zeros would be 1/(n\u03c0) - 1/((n+1)\u03c0) = (1/n\u03c0) - (1/(n+1)\u03c0) = (n+1 - n)/(n(n+1)\u03c0) = 1/(n(n+1)\u03c0). So, the spacing between zeros decreases as n increases, which makes sense because as x gets smaller, the function oscillates more.\n\nWait, but I'm supposed to count the number of zeros in (0.0001, 0.001). Each zero occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001). So, n must satisfy 1/(0.001) < n\u03c0 < 1/(0.0001), which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, dividing by \u03c0, we get 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.31 < n < 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if 1/(319\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. Let me compute 1/(319\u03c0). 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 1002. So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002 \u2248 0.000998, which is approximately 0.001, but just slightly less. Wait, no, 1/1000 is 0.001, so 1/1002 is approximately 0.000998, which is less than 0.001. So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000998, which is within (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000) \u2248 0.0001. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound. So, n=319 gives x\u22480.000998, which is just below 0.001, and n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001, which is the lower bound. So, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive will give x in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000998, which is less than 0.001, and n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is greater than 0.0001. So, all these x's are within the interval. So, the count is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the number of zeros is approximately the difference between 1/(0.0001\u03c0) and 1/(0.001\u03c0), but that would be an approximation. Let's see: 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, and 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. So, the number of zeros is approximately 3183.098 - 318.309 \u2248 2864.789, which is about 2865. So, that confirms the count.\n\nWait, but let me think again: the function sin(1/x) has a zero at every x=1/(n\u03c0). So, the number of zeros in (a, b) is the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (a, b). So, solving for n, we get n in (1/(b\u03c0), 1/(a\u03c0)). So, the number of integers n in that interval is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) + 1, perhaps? Wait, let me check that.\n\nWait, if I have an interval (a, b), then the condition is a < 1/(n\u03c0) < b. So, 1/(b\u03c0) < n < 1/(a\u03c0). So, n must be greater than 1/(b\u03c0) and less than 1/(a\u03c0). So, the number of integers n is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)).\n\nWait, let me test this with numbers. Here, a=0.0001, b=0.001.\n\n1/(a\u03c0) = 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098\n\n1/(b\u03c0) = 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309\n\nSo, the number of integers n is floor(3183.098) - ceil(318.309) + 1.\n\nWait, floor(3183.098) is 3183, and ceil(318.309) is 319. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865, which matches our previous result.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people use the formula floor(upper) - ceil(lower) + 1, but I think in this case, it's just floor(upper) - ceil(lower) +1, but let me confirm.\n\nWait, if I have an interval (c, d), the number of integers n satisfying c < n < d is floor(d - 1) - ceil(c + 1) + 1? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of specific numbers.\n\nSuppose c=2.3 and d=5.8. The integers between 2.3 and 5.8 are 3,4,5. So, that's 3 numbers. floor(5.8)=5, ceil(2.3)=3. So, 5 - 3 +1=3. Correct. So, yes, the formula is floor(d) - ceil(c) +1.\n\nIn our case, c=1/(b\u03c0)=318.309, d=1/(a\u03c0)=3183.098. So, floor(d)=3183, ceil(c)=319. So, 3183 - 319 +1=2865. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about a smaller interval to test this formula. Suppose I take a=0.001 and b=0.002. Then, 1/(a\u03c0)=1/(0.001\u03c0)=318.309, and 1/(b\u03c0)=1/(0.002\u03c0)=159.155. So, the number of integers n between 159.155 and 318.309 is 318 - 160 +1=159. Let me check: n from 160 to 318 inclusive. 318 - 160=158, plus 1 is 159. So, that seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, if I take a=0.0005 and b=0.0015, then 1/(a\u03c0)=1/(0.0005\u03c0)=636.618, and 1/(b\u03c0)=1/(0.0015\u03c0)=212.206. So, the number of integers n is floor(636.618)=636, ceil(212.206)=213. So, 636 - 213 +1=424. Let me check: n from 213 to 636 inclusive. 636 - 213=423, plus 1=424. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, in our original problem, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again: in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), how does the function behave? It oscillates more and more as x approaches zero. So, the number of zeros increases as x decreases. So, the count should be the number of n's such that x=1/(n\u03c0) is in that interval, which is exactly what we computed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the length of the interval in terms of \u03b8. Let me set \u03b8=1/x. Then, when x=0.0001, \u03b8=1/0.0001=10000. When x=0.001, \u03b8=1/0.001=1000. So, \u03b8 decreases from 10000 to 1000 as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001. So, the function sin(\u03b8) has zeros at \u03b8=n\u03c0. So, between \u03b8=1000 and \u03b8=10000, how many multiples of \u03c0 are there? The number of zeros would be the number of integers n such that 1000 \u2264 n\u03c0 \u2264 10000. So, n ranges from ceil(1000/\u03c0) to floor(10000/\u03c0). Let's compute:\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so ceil(318.309)=319.\n\n10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so floor(3183.098)=3183.\n\nThus, the number of integers n is 3183 - 319 +1=2865. So, that's another way to get the same result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), n ranges from 319 to 3183, yielding 2865 intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

    "text": " If 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, then n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. And 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 is 2865. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me think about whether each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept in that interval. Since as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000. So, sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly as x approaches 0. So, between 0.0001 and 0.001, 1/x goes from 10000 to 1000, which is a range of 9000. Each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the sine function completes a half-period, so each \u03c0 interval in 1/x corresponds to an intercept. So, the number of intercepts should be roughly the number of times \u03c0 fits into the interval from 1000 to 10000, which is (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 \u2248 9000/3.1416 \u2248 2866. But wait, that's slightly different from the 2865 I calculated earlier. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the exact calculation. Let me see: The number of zeros should be the number of times 1/x crosses each multiple of \u03c0 as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001. So, starting at x = 0.001, which is 1/1000, so 1/x = 1000. The next zero would be at 1/x = 1000 + \u03c0, which is approximately 1003.1416, so x \u2248 1/1003.1416 \u2248 0.00099687. Then the next zero at 1/x = 1000 + 2\u03c0 \u2248 1006.2832, x \u2248 1/1006.2832 \u2248 0.00099377, and so on, until 1/x reaches 10000, which is x = 0.0001. So, the number of zeros is the number of n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Wait, 1/x starts at 1000 when x is 0.001 and increases to 10000 when x is 0.0001. So, each time 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0, we get a zero. So, the first zero after x=0.001 is at 1/x = 1000 + \u03c0, then 1000 + 2\u03c0, and so on, up to just below 10000. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that matches my earlier calculation. But wait, when I thought about it as (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0, that's 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.226, which would suggest 2866 zeros, but that's not exactly precise because we're dealing with integer n. So, perhaps the exact count is 2865. Alternatively, maybe I should check whether 3183\u03c0 is less than 10000. Let's compute 3183 * \u03c0: 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 Let me compute 3000*3.1416 = 9424.8, and 183*3.1416 \u2248 575.0448, so total \u2248 9424.8 + 575.0448 \u2248 10,000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound of the interval. So, the x-intercept at n=3183 is exactly at x=0.0001, but the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.0001, so we shouldn't include n=3183 because x=0.0001 is not included. Similarly, n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.14) \u2248 0.00099687, which is within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, perhaps I need to adjust the upper limit. So, n must satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which is n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n starts at 319. And 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which is n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but since x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 is excluded, do we include n=3183? Wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), x must be greater than 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, which is not included. So, actually, n must be less than 3183.098, so n can go up to 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is the lower bound, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010004, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. Wait, that might be a mistake. Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0) and 1/(3182\u03c0). Let's compute 3183\u03c0: as above, approximately 10,000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.0001, we need to exclude x=0.0001. So, n must satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, so n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n can be up to 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded, so the largest n is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010003, which is just above 0.0001. So, now, n ranges from 319 to 3182, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 = 2864. So, that would give 2864 x-intercepts. But wait, earlier I thought it was 2865. So, where is the confusion?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in whether to include n=3183. Let's think carefully: The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at both ends. So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, 1/(0.001) < n\u03c0 < 1/(0.0001), which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, dividing by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be integers strictly greater than 318.309 and strictly less than 3183.098. So, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest integer n is 3183, but wait, 3183 is less than 3183.098, so 3183 is included. But wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, which is excluded. So, actually, n must satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which is n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 is excluded. Therefore, the largest n is 3182 because 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010003, which is just above 0.0001 and included in the interval. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 = 2864. So, 2864 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, so it's excluded. Therefore, n can go up to 3182. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nBut earlier I had 2865. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let's think differently. The number of zeros is the number of times 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0 as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001. So, the number of zeros is equal to the number of n where 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, because 1/x starts at 1000 and goes up to 10000.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nSo, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098.\n\nSo, n can be integers from 319 to 3183, inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nBut wait, 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, which is excluded. So, n=3183 would give x=0.0001, which is not included, so n can only go up to 3182.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nBut which is correct?\n\nWait, let's test with smaller numbers to see.\n\nSuppose I have an interval (a, b), and I want to count integers n where c < n < d.\n\nIf c = 318.309, d=3183.098, then n must be integers from 319 to 3183.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nBut in the context of the problem, x must be greater than 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which is n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 is excluded, so n can only be up to 3182.\n\nWait, but if n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded, so n=3183 is not allowed. So, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nBut now I'm confused because two different approaches are giving me two different answers.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, which is excluded. So, n can only go up to 3182, making the count 2864.\n\nBut earlier, when considering the interval for n as (318.309, 3183.098), the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865, but since n=3183 is excluded, it's 2864.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct answer is 2864.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the floor and ceiling functions correctly.\n\nSo, the number of n is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0).\n\nCompute 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so floor(10000/\u03c0) = 3183.\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so ceil(1000/\u03c0) = 319.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nBut since x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 is excluded, we have to subtract 1, making it 2864.\n\nWait, but is that accurate? Because when n=3183, x=0.0001 is excluded, so n=3183 does not correspond to an x in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0) = 3183 - 319 = 2864, but since we include both endpoints, we add 1, but since the upper bound is excluded, we don't add 1. Wait, no, the formula for the number of integers between a and b inclusive is b - a + 1. But in this case, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098, so n ranges from 319 to 3183, but n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. So, n goes up to 3182, making the count 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, perhaps I made a mistake in including n=3183.\n\nLet me confirm with an example.\n\nSuppose I have the interval (0.0001, 0.001), and I want to find n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nSo, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098.\n\n1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309.\n\nSo, n must be integers from 319 to 3183, but n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. So, n can only go up to 3182.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nThis gives:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098\n\nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3182 (since n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded).

So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me think about whether each n in that range corresponds to a unique x in the interval. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), each n gives a unique x, and as n increases, x decreases. So, the smallest x in the interval would be when n is largest, which is x = 1/(3183\u03c0), and the largest x in the interval would be when n is smallest, which is x = 1/(319\u03c0). Let me check if these x values are indeed within (0.0001, 0.001). Let's compute x when n=319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(319 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(1003.05) \u2248 0.000997, which is approximately 0.000997, which is greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001, so that's good. Now, when n=3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000.02) \u2248 0.00009999, which is just below 0.0001, so it's not included. Wait, that's a problem. Because x must be greater than 0.0001. So, x = 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included in the interval. So, actually, the maximum n should be such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, solving for n: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, the maximum integer n is 3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x\u22480.00009999, which is less than 0.0001. So, actually, the maximum n should be such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, let's solve for n in 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. Rearranged, n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, the maximum integer n is 3183, but when n=3183, x is just below 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because n=3183 gives x below the lower bound. Wait, let's check that. If n=3182, then x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182*3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000.00) \u2248 0.0001, which is exactly 0.0001. But the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.0001, so x must be greater than 0.0001. So, x=0.0001 is not included, so n=3182 gives x\u22480.0001, which is not included. Therefore, the maximum n should be such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, n must be less than 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x\u22480.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, but let's check n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182*3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000.00) \u2248 0.0001, which is exactly 0.0001, but since the interval is open, we need x > 0.0001, so n must be less than 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but n=3183 gives x just below 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3183, but we have to exclude it because x=1/(3183\u03c0) < 0.0001. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, but let's check: n=3182 gives x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but since the interval is open, we need x > 0.0001. So, perhaps n starts at 319, but n=3183 is excluded. Therefore, the number of valid n is from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, let's compute 3182 - 319 +1. 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. Wait, so earlier I thought it was 2865, but now I'm getting 2864. Which one is correct? Let's go back. The initial calculation was n from 319 to 3183, but n=3183 is excluded because x=1/(3183\u03c0) < 0.0001. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864. So, the correct number is 2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but let me make sure. Let me take a small example to test. Suppose I have n from 3 to 5 inclusive. So, n=3,4,5: that's 3 numbers. 5 -3 +1=3. Correct. Now, if n=3 to 5, but n=5 is excluded, so n=3,4: 2 numbers. 4 -3 +1=2. Correct. So, in our case, n=319 to 3182 inclusive: 3182 -319 +1=2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. So, I think my initial calculation was wrong because I included n=3183, which actually gives x just below 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the correct number is 2864. Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of zeros of sin(1/x) between x=a and x=b, where a=0.0001 and b=0.001. The function sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0, with the oscillations becoming more frequent. Each zero crossing occurs at x=1/(n\u03c0), so between a and b, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is between a and b. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > a \u21d2 n < 1/(a\u03c0) and 1/(n\u03c0) < b \u21d2 n > 1/(b\u03c0). So, n must satisfy 1/(b\u03c0) < n < 1/(a\u03c0). Since n must be an integer, the number of n is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) +1? Wait, no, because n must be greater than 1/(b\u03c0) and less than 1/(a\u03c0). So, the number of integers n is floor(1/(a\u03c0) -1) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) +1? Wait, maybe it's better to compute it as floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) +1 if I'm counting inclusive. Let me compute 1/(a\u03c0) where a=0.0001: 1/(0.0001 * \u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, floor(3183.098)=3183. Similarly, 1/(b\u03c0) where b=0.001: 1/(0.001 * \u03c0) \u2248 318.309. So, ceil(318.309)=319. So, the number of integers n is 3183 -319 +1=2865. Wait, but earlier I thought that n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00009999<0.0001, which is excluded. So, perhaps the formula gives 2865, but in reality, n=3183 is excluded, so we need to subtract 1, making it 2864. Hmm, so which is correct? Let me think. The formula floor(1/(a\u03c0)) gives 3183, and ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) gives 319. So, the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive is 3183 -319 +1=2865. But in reality, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00009999<0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, so the number of integers is 3182 -319 +1=2864. Therefore, the correct number is 2864. So, the formula gives 2865, but we have to subtract 1 because the upper bound is exclusive. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used floor(1/(a\u03c0) -1) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) +1. Let me compute 1/(a\u03c0)=3183.098, so floor(1/(a\u03c0))=3183. But since x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than a=0.0001, we have to exclude it. So, the maximum n is 3182. Therefore, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 -319 +1=2864. So, the answer is 2864. Wait, but let me check with another approach. The function sin(1/x) has zeros at x=1/(n\u03c0), so between x=a and x=b, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is between a and b. So, a <1/(n\u03c0)<b \u21d2 1/b <n<1/a. So, n must be greater than 1/b and less than 1/a. Therefore, the number of integers n is floor(1/a) - ceil(1/b). Let me compute 1/a=1/0.0001=10000, 1/b=1/0.001=1000. So, floor(1/a)=10000, ceil(1/b)=1000. So, the number of integers n is 10000 -1000=9000. Wait, that can't be right because we have a much smaller interval. Wait, no, because in this case, a=0.0001 and b=0.001, so 1/a=10000, 1/b=1000. So, n must be between 1000 and 10000. So, the number of integers from 1001 to 9999 inclusive is 9999 -1001 +1=8999. Wait, that's way too high. But that's because I'm not considering the \u03c0 factor. Wait, no, in the initial problem, n is such that x=1/(n\u03c0). So, the inequalities are 0.0001 <1/(n\u03c0)<0.001 \u21d2 1000 <n\u03c0<10000 \u21d2 1000/\u03c0 <n<10000/\u03c0. So, 1000/\u03c0\u2248318.309, 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.098. So, n must be between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 -319 +1=2865. But as we saw earlier, n=3183 gives x\u22480.00009999<0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the correct number is 2864. So, the formula floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) +1 would give 3183 -319 +1=2865, but since n=3183 is excluded, we have to subtract 1, giving 2864. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is floor(1/(a\u03c0) -1) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) +1. Let me compute floor(1/(a\u03c0) -1)=floor(3183.098 -1)=floor(3182.098)=3182. Then, ceil(1/(b\u03c0))=319. So, 3182 -319 +1=2864. Yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. So, to summarize: The zeros occur at x=1/(n\u03c0) for integer n. We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so n must satisfy 319 \u2264n\u22643182. Therefore, the number of integers is 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n</think>\n\nThe number of x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is determined by finding the integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies within the interval. Solving for n gives the range from 319 to 3182, resulting in 2864 intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2864}$"

So, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319. 3183 - 300 = 2883, 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, that's correct. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in that interval. Wait, but let me think again. Does each n correspond to exactly one x-intercept? Yes, because for each integer n, there's exactly one x = 1/(n\u03c0) in the interval. So, each n gives a unique x-intercept. So, the number of x-intercepts is equal to the number of integers n in that range. So, 2865 is the answer. But just to make sure, let me consider if there's any possibility that some x might fall exactly at 0.0001 or 0.001, but since the interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), we're excluding the endpoints. So, x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001, but since 1/(n\u03c0) is a continuous function, and we're dealing with an open interval, we don't have to worry about including or excluding those exact points because x approaches them but doesn't reach them. So, our count remains 2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n.

For 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n\u03c0 > 1000 => n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n \u2265 319. So yes, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. That seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Hmm, but let me think again. Each n corresponds to a unique x in the interval, right? So, each integer n from 319 to 3183 gives a distinct x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, that should be the count.

Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309, so the minimum integer n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but let me check if 1/(319\u03c0) is indeed greater than 0.0001. Let's compute 1/(319\u03c0): \u03c0 \u2248 3.1416, so 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 1004. So, 1/1004 \u2248 0.000996, which is approximately 0.000996, which is less than 0.001, so that's okay. Wait, but 0.000996 is less than 0.001, so 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000996 < 0.001, which is within the upper bound. Similarly, for n=3183, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183*3.1416) \u2248 1/10000 \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound. So, n=319 gives x\u22480.000996, which is within (0.0001, 0.001), and n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001, which is just above 0.0001. Wait, but 0.0001 is the lower limit, but the interval is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001, so n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, but is that greater than 0.0001? Let me compute 3183\u03c0: 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416. Let me compute 3000 * 3.1416 = 9424.8, and 183 * 3.1416 \u2248 575.06, so total \u2248 9424.8 + 575.06 \u2248 10,000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10,000 = 0.0001. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so x=0.0001 is not included. Therefore, n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is not in the interval. Therefore, n must be less than 3183, so the maximum n is 3182. Wait, that's a problem. Because when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is excluded. So, the maximum n is 3182, because n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is not in the interval. Similarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.000996, which is less than 0.001, so that's okay. So, the range of n is from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 is 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but now I'm getting 2864 because n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. Let me confirm this. So, if n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is not in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3182. So, the number of terms is 3182 - 319 +1. Let's compute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then -19 more: 2882 -19=2863. Then +1: 2864. So, 2864 x-intercepts. Therefore, the answer should be 2864. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial substitution. Let me re-express the inequalities. We have x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x=1/(n\u03c0), then 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities because reciprocals reverse the inequality for positive numbers), we get 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Then, dividing by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. But wait, earlier I thought that n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so n must be up to 3182. But let's check: n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is exactly 0.0001, but the interval is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001. Therefore, n=3183 is excluded. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but wait, 3183.098 is just a bit more than 3183, so the integer part is 3183, but since n must be less than 3183.098, n can be up to 3183. But wait, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)=1/(\u03c0*3183). Let me compute this more accurately. Let's compute 3183*\u03c0: 3183*3.1415926535. Let's compute 3183*3=9549, 3183*0.1415926535\u22483183*0.1416\u22483183*0.1=318.3, 3183*0.04=127.32, 3183*0.0016\u22485.0928. Adding those: 318.3+127.32=445.62+5.0928\u2248450.7128. So total \u03c0*3183\u22489549 + 450.7128\u224810,000. So, \u03c0*3183\u224810,000, so 1/(\u03c0*3183)=0.0001 exactly. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, x=0.0001 is excluded. Therefore, n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is not in the interval. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 +1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 is 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Therefore, the final answer is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). To find x in (0.0001, 0.001), solve 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. This gives 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3182, yielding 2864 intercepts.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}."

So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which gives 2865 integers. Hmm, that seems like a lot of intercepts. Let me visualize the function y = sin(1/x). As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates increasingly rapidly. So, near x = 0.0001, which is very close to zero, the function is oscillating very rapidly, leading to many zeros. As x increases towards 0.001, the oscillations slow down because 1/x decreases. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), the function will have a large number of oscillations, each crossing the x-axis twice (once going up, once going down), except possibly at the endpoints. Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I only considered the zeros where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs once every \u03c0 interval for 1/x. So, each zero corresponds to a single crossing. Wait, no, actually, sin(\u03b8) crosses zero once every \u03c0 interval, but between each zero, it goes from positive to negative or vice versa. So, each time \u03b8 increases by \u03c0, sin(\u03b8) crosses zero once. So, for each n, x = 1/(n\u03c0) is a zero. So, the number of zeros in the interval (a, b) would be the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is between a and b. So, in this case, a = 0.0001 and b = 0.001. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n where 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001). Which is exactly what I calculated earlier: n from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 zeros. But wait, let me check if x = 1/(n\u03c0) is indeed in (0.0001, 0.001). For n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.7) \u2248 0.000996, which is less than 0.001 and greater than 0.0001. For n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) \u2248 0.0001, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), we have to check if 0.0001 is included. The interval is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001, not equal. So, n must be such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n can be up to 3183, but we need to check if 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Let's compute 1/(3183 * \u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001. So, exactly 0.0001. But since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so n must be less than 3183.098, meaning n can be up to 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is not included. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but we have to check if 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Wait, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. So, it's exactly 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.098, meaning n can be up to 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is not included. So, the maximum n is 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded. So, does that mean n can only go up to 3182? Wait, let's compute 1/(3182\u03c0). 3182\u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000 - (3183\u03c0 - 3182\u03c0) \u2248 10000 - \u03c0 \u2248 10000 - 3.1416 \u2248 9996.8584. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.8584 \u2248 0.00010003, which is just slightly above 0.0001. So, that would be included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Now, let's calculate the number of integers from 319 to 3182. Using the formula: last - first + 1 = 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863. Then add 1: 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, the number of zeros is 2864. Wait, so earlier I thought it was 2865, but now I'm getting 2864 because n goes up to 3182 instead of 3183. Let me confirm this. The initial calculation was n > 318.309, so n starts at 319. And n < 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but since x=1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001 is excluded, n must be up to 3182. So, the number of integers is from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. Therefore, the correct number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but let me check with specific values. Let me take n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.000996, which is less than 0.001 and greater than 0.0001, so included. n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.00010003, which is just above 0.0001, so included. n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is excluded. So, n goes from 319 to 3182, which is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Therefore, the final answer is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). For x in (0.0001, 0.001), we find n such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3182, giving 2864 intercepts.\n\n\\boxed{2864}"

So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of terms is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but let me check: 3183 minus 319. Let me compute 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then minus 19 is 2864. Then plus 1 is 2865. Yes, that seems right. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Hmm, that's a lot! But considering the interval is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a very narrow range near zero, the function sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely as x approaches zero, so the number of intercepts should indeed be very large. Wait, but in our case, the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is from 0.0001 to 0.001, so as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000. So, \u03b8 = 1/x goes from 10000 down to 1000 radians. Now, sin(\u03b8) crosses zero whenever \u03b8 is a multiple of \u03c0, so between 1000 and 10000, how many multiples of \u03c0 are there? The number of zeros would be the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.

So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but let me think again. When I have n starting at 319 and ending at 3183, the number of terms is (3183 - 319) + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. So, 2864 + 1 = 2865. That seems right. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me think about whether all these x-values are indeed within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). For example, when n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0). Let me compute that: 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 1003. So, x \u2248 1/1003 \u2248 0.000997, which is approximately 0.001, but slightly less. Wait, 0.000997 is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Similarly, when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0). Let's compute that: 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000. So, x \u2248 1/10000 = 0.0001, but since n is 3183, which is less than 3183.098, x would be slightly more than 0.0001, so it's within the interval.

Similarly, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is the lower bound, but since it's greater than 0.0001, it's included.

So, n is from 319 to 3183, inclusive. So, the number of integers is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but let me think again: when you have an interval from a to b inclusive, the number of integers is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct. So, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But wait, let me consider whether the endpoints are included. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. So, we need to check if x = 1/(n\u03c0) equals 0.0001 or 0.001 for any integer n. Let's see: 1/(n\u03c0) = 0.0001 implies n = 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, which is not an integer, so x=0.0001 is not included. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) = 0.001 implies n = 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309, which is also not an integer, so x=0.001 is not included either. Therefore, all the x-intercepts in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001) correspond to n from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the count is 2865. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial setup. The function sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. The closer x is to 0, the more rapid the oscillations. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), x is very close to 0, so the function oscillates very rapidly. Each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the sine function completes a half-period, crossing zero. So, the number of zeros should correspond to how many times 1/x passes through multiples of \u03c0 as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001. Alternatively, as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000. So, 1/x goes from 10000 down to 1000, and we need to find how many multiples of \u03c0 are in that interval. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Wait, that seems different from what I did earlier. Let me clarify: 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, 1/x = n\u03c0, so n = 1/(\u03c0 x). Since x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. Therefore, n = 1/(\u03c0 x) must be between 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, same as before. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that seems consistent.

Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that seems correct. But wait, let me think about whether n can be 3183 or not. Since 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 1/(3183*3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, but the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001, not equal.

So, x=0.0001 is not included because the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.0001. So, does n=3183 give x=1/(3183\u03c0) which is just slightly larger than 0.0001? Wait, no, because 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001. Wait, that can't be right because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since \u03c0 \u2248 3.1416, 3183*3.1416 \u2248 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 exactly. But since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is not included. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the largest integer n is 3183, but does x=1/(3183\u03c0) fall within the interval? Let's check: 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), x must be greater than 0.0001. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but is it greater or less than 0.0001? Let's compute more accurately: 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3000*\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, and 183*\u03c0 \u2248 574.547, so total \u2248 9424.77796 + 574.547 \u2248 9999.32496. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.32496, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.32496 \u2248 0.0001000067. So, that's approximately 0.0001000067, which is just slightly above 0.0001. So, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000067, which is greater than 0.0001, so it is included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 is acceptable. Similarly, let's check n=319: 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(319*3.1416) \u2248 1/(1002.45) \u2248 0.00099756, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Wait, but 0.00099756 is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval. So, n=319 gives x\u22480.00099756, which is within (0.0001, 0.001). So, both n=319 and n=3183 are included. Therefore, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n, which correspond to 2865 x-intercepts in the given interval. Wait, but let me think again: when I calculated 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000067, which is just barely above 0.0001, so it's included. Similarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.00099756, which is just below 0.001, so it's included as well. So, both endpoints are included because the function at those n's gives x within the open interval. Therefore, the count is correct at 2865. But let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe by considering how many oscillations the function sin(1/x) makes as x approaches 0. As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a small interval near zero, the function will oscillate many times, but we need to count how many times it crosses the x-axis, i.e., how many zeros it has.\n\nSo, each zero occurs at x=1/(n\u03c0), so we can think of n starting from 1 upwards, but in our case, x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, so n must be such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in that range. So, the smallest n where 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 is n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309, so n=319 is the first n where x=1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Similarly, the largest n where 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so n=3183 is the last n where x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. Therefore, the number of n's is from 319 to 3183, inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial substitution. So, starting from sin(1/x) = 0, which implies 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, for each integer n, we have an x-intercept at x=1/(n\u03c0). Now, we need x to be in (0.0001, 0.001). So, substituting x=1/(n\u03c0), we get 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities because reciprocating positive numbers reverses the inequality), we get 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Then, dividing by \u03c0, we get 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating those: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be an integer strictly greater than 318.309 and strictly less than 3183.098. But since n must be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319, and the largest possible n is 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that's consistent with what I had before.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. When I take reciprocals, I have to be careful about the direction of the inequalities. Let me double-check that step. Starting from 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals on all parts, remembering that when you take reciprocals, the inequalities reverse. So, 1/(0.001) > n\u03c0 > 1/(0.0001). Which is 1000 > n\u03c0 > 10000. Wait, that can't be right because 1/(0.001) is 1000, and 1/(0.0001) is 10000, so 1000 > n\u03c0 > 10000? That doesn't make sense because 1000 is less than 10000. So, I must have made a mistake here. Wait, no, the original inequality is 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, taking reciprocals, since all terms are positive, the inequalities reverse. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. That makes more sense because 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.309 < n < 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. So, that's correct. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the reciprocal step. So, starting with 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals, we have to reverse the inequalities, so 1/0.001 > n\u03c0 > 1/0.0001. Which is 1000 > n\u03c0 > 10000. Wait, that can't be right because 1000 is less than 10000. So, that would imply that n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000, which is the same as 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 and less than 10000/\u03c0, which is what I had before. So, that's correct. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, giving 2865 integer values. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when x approaches 0 from the right, sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times, but in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a finite interval, the function will oscillate a finite number of times, but each oscillation corresponds to a zero crossing. So, each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the sine function completes a half-period, going from 0 up to 1 and back to 0, which would correspond to a zero crossing. So, the number of zero crossings would be proportional to the change in 1/x over the interval. Let me compute the change in 1/x as x goes from 0.0001 to 0.001. So, 1/x goes from 10000 to 1000. So, the total change is 10000 - 1000 = 9000. Each zero crossing occurs every \u03c0 units in 1/x. So, the number of zero crossings would be approximately the total change divided by \u03c0, which is 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.198. Hmm, that's close to 2865, which is what I got earlier. The difference is due to the endpoints: since the interval is open, we don't include the exact endpoints, so the number is 2865 instead of 2866. So, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but let me think about this approximation. The exact number is 2865, which is very close to 9000/\u03c0. So, that seems to confirm that the number of zeros is approximately the total change in 1/x divided by \u03c0, which is the distance between consecutive zeros. So, that's another way to see why the number is 2865.\n\nSo, to summarize: The function y = sin(1/x) has zeros at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for each integer n. We need to find how many such x lie in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Solving for n, we find that n must be between approximately 318.309 and 3183.098. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, giving 2865 integer values. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me compute 3183 - 319 + 1 again. 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Yes, that's correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning, and the approximation method also gives a similar result, so I'm confident that 2865 is the right number of x-intercepts in the given interval.\n</think>\n\nThe function \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) has x-intercepts where \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\), which occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for integer \\( n \\).

So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Wait, 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that seems right. But wait, let me confirm with an example. Suppose n starts at 319 and ends at 319: that's 1 number. If n starts at 319 and ends at 320, that's 2 numbers. So, 319 and 320: 320 - 319 +1 = 2. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 x-intercepts in that interval. Wait, but let me think again: as x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a small interval near zero, the function will oscillate a lot, but the number of zeros should be finite because we're excluding x=0. So, 2865 seems plausible. Let me see: 1/(0.001) is 1000, and 1/(0.0001) is 10000. So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000 in this interval. So, sin(1/x) will have zeros whenever 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which is the same as 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.309 < n < 3183.098, as before. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 -19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2865. So, yes, 2865 is the correct count.

So, between x = 0.0001 and x = 0.001, the function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x gets smaller. Each oscillation corresponds to a zero crossing, which is an x-intercept. So, the number of zero crossings is essentially how many times 1/x passes through multiples of \u03c0 as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001. Each time 1/x crosses n\u03c0, where n is an integer, we get a zero. So, the number of zeros is equal to the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is between 0.0001 and 0.001.

Similarly, 1/(0.001) is 1000, so 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than 318.30988618 and less than 3183.0988618. Therefore, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest is 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 gives 2865. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, leading to x = 1/(n\u03c0). Within the interval (0.0001, 0.001), n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"
