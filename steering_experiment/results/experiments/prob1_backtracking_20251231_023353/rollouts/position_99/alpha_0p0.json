But wait, let me think again about the inequalities. When solving for n, I had n > 318.309 and n < 3183.098. So, n must be an integer greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer is 319, and less than 3183.098, so the largest integer is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that's correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me consider a smaller interval and see if the formula works. Suppose I have the interval (0.01, 0.1). Let's find the number of x-intercepts there. Using the same method: x = 1/(n\u03c0), so 0.01 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.1. Solving for n: 1/(0.01\u03c0) \u2248 318.309, and 1/(0.1\u03c0) \u2248 31.831. So, n must be greater than 31.831 and less than 318.309. So, n ranges from 32 to 318 inclusive. Number of integers: 318 - 32 +1 = 287. Let me check with actual values: For n=32, x=1/(32\u03c0)\u22480.0997, which is just below 0.1, so included. For n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.01003, which is just above 0.01, so included.

Wait, but let me check if I made a miscalculation in the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Let me compute 3183 - 319 = 2864, then adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, let me take a smaller example. Suppose I have n from 2 to 5 inclusive. That's 4 numbers: 2,3,4,5. Using the formula: 5-2=3, 3+1=4. Correct. Another example: n from 1 to 3. 3-1=2, 2+1=3. Correct. So, applying that, 3183-319=2864, 2864+1=2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, I just thought of something else. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), the function is oscillating rapidly. Each oscillation crosses the x-axis twice, right? Once going up and once going down. But wait, no, that's for functions like sin(1/x), which does cross the x-axis twice per period. Wait, but in our case, we're looking for zeros, which occur every \u03c0/(n) where n is an integer. Wait, no, actually, in the function sin(1/x), the zeros occur at 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, each zero is spaced at intervals of 1/(n\u03c0) from the next. Wait, but the distance between consecutive zeros is 1/(n\u03c0) - 1/((n+1)\u03c0) = (n+1 - n)/(\u03c0(n+1)n) ) = 1/(\u03c0n(n+1)). So, the spacing between zeros decreases as n increases, which makes sense because the function oscillates more rapidly as x approaches zero. But in any case, each zero corresponds to a unique n, so each x-intercept is at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n, and we've found that n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 2865 x-intercepts. Wait, but just to make sure, let me think about whether each n corresponds to exactly one x in the interval. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0) is a strictly decreasing function of n, each n gives a unique x, and since n is an integer, each x is distinct. Therefore, the count should be correct. So, I think the answer is 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0).

So, in this case, a = 0.0001, b = 0.001. So, the number of n's is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) +1. Let me compute 1/(a\u03c0) = 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u22483183.098. So, floor(3183.098) = 3183. Similarly, 1/(b\u03c0) = 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248318.309. So, ceil(318.309) = 319. Therefore, the number of n's is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.

So, both endpoints are included in the open interval because their x values are just outside the endpoints. Wait, no, the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, if x is exactly 0.0001, it's not included, but if it's just above, like 0.0001000028, it's included.

Therefore, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 2865 x-intercepts. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but just to be thorough, let me check n=319 and n=3183 again. For n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.5) \u2248 0.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. For n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000028, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. So, both ends are included, so the count is correct at 2865.

So, yes, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me check another thing. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is very close to zero, the function oscillates rapidly. Each time 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0, the sine function crosses zero. So, the number of zeros should correspond to how many times 1/x passes through n\u03c0 as x moves from 0.001 down to 0.0001. So, when x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001, 1/x increases from 1000 to 10000. So, 1/x goes from 1000 to 10000. The zeros occur at 1/x = n\u03c0, so n must satisfy n\u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. So, n must be between 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, same as before. Therefore, the number of n's is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3183 - 319. Let me compute 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 -19=2864. Then 2864 +1=2865. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\). This occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for some integer \\( n \\), which implies \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n\nWe need \\( x \\) to be within the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\). Therefore, we solve the inequalities:\n\\[ 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\]\n\nRewriting these inequalities:\n1. \\( 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\) implies \\( n < \\frac{1}{0.0001\\pi} \\approx 3183.098 \\)\n2. \\( \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\) implies \\( n > \\frac{1}{0.001\\pi} \\approx 318.309 \\)\n\nThus, \\( n \\) must be an integer in the range from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers in this range is calculated as:\n\\[ 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts is \\(\\boxed{2865}\\)."

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me check the exact values. Let me compute 1/(n\u03c0) for n=3183 and n=319. For n=3183: 1/(3183 * \u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000.0) exactly? Wait, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.0415926535 \u2248 let's compute 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, 3183 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 approximately 5.09. So total for 0.1415926535 is 318.3 + 127.32 + 5.09 \u2248 450.71. So total is 9549 + 450.71 \u2248 9999.71. So, 1/(9999.71) \u2248 0.0001000028, which is indeed just over 0.0001, so included in the interval. For n=319: 1/(319 * \u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.5) \u2248 0.0009965, which is just under 0.001, so included as well. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 2865 x-intercepts. Wait, but I'm a bit concerned because when I think about the function sin(1/x), as x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a finite interval, we're looking for the number of zeros. So, each zero corresponds to a crossing at x = 1/(n\u03c0). Therefore, the number of zeros should be the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) lies in (0.0001, 0.001). So, the count is indeed 2865. Wait, but let me think again: when n increases by 1, x decreases by a small amount. So, the spacing between consecutive zeros is decreasing as x approaches zero. But in our case, the interval is between 0.0001 and 0.001, so the number of zeros should be approximately the difference in the reciprocals scaled by \u03c0. Alternatively, the number of zeros can be approximated by the integral of dx/(x^2) from 0.0001 to 0.001, but that might be overcomplicating. Alternatively, the number of zeros is the number of n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001). So, solving for n, as I did before, gives n from 319 to 3183, which is 2865 zeros. Therefore, I think the answer is 2865. Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3183 - 319 +1 again. 3183 minus 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Yes, that's correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). To find the number of such x in (0.0001, 0.001), solve 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, yielding n between approximately 318.31 and 3183.09. The integers n range from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The count is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

Wait, but let me think about whether there's a possibility that some n might result in x being outside the interval. For example, if n=318, then x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22481/(1000.7)\u22480.0009993, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval.

But wait, n=318 gives x\u22480.0009993, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, perhaps my initial calculation was wrong.

Because sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely as x approaches 0, but in this interval, which is between 0.0001 and 0.001, the function is oscillating, but the number of zeros should correspond to the number of times 1/x crosses multiples of \u03c0.

So, both endpoints are included in the open interval because the function approaches the endpoints from inside. Therefore, the count is indeed 2865. Wait, but let me just cross-verify with another approach. The function sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. The number of oscillations increases as x approaches 0. The distance between consecutive zeros of sin(1/x) is when 1/x increases by \u03c0, so the change in x is such that 1/(x2) - 1/(x1) = \u03c0. So, the number of zeros between x=a and x=b would be roughly (1/a - 1/b)/\u03c0. Let's try that. Here, a=0.0001 and b=0.001. So, 1/a = 10000, 1/b = 1000. So, the difference is 10000 - 1000 = 9000. Divided by \u03c0, that's 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.197. But since we're dealing with an open interval, we might need to adjust. Wait, but earlier we got 2865. Hmm, this is close. So, maybe the exact count is 2865, and this approximation gives 2866. The difference is probably because the exact calculation includes both endpoints when they fall inside the interval, whereas the approximation might be a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps the exact count is 2865, and the approximation is 2866, but since we're dealing with an open interval, perhaps the exact count is 2865. Alternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation in the exact count. Let me double-check the exact count. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of terms is 3183 - 319 +1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 -19=2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, that seems correct.

Wait, let me compute 3183 * \u03c0 more accurately. Let's compute \u03c0 as 3.1415926535. So, 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute 3000 * \u03c0 = 9424.77796. Then, 183 * \u03c0: 183 * 3 = 549, 183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 183 * 0.1 = 18.3, 183 * 0.0415926535 \u2248 7.572. So, 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 549 + 18.3 + 7.572 \u2248 574.872. So total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796 + 574.872 \u2248 9999.64996. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.65, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.65 \u2248 0.0001000035. So, that's just above 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3184 * 3.1415926535). Let's compute 3184\u03c0: 3184 * 3.1415926535. 3000\u03c0 is 9424.77796, 184\u03c0 \u2248 184 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 577.544. So, total \u2248 9424.77796 + 577.544 \u2248 9999.32196. So, 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.32196 \u2248 0.0001000067, which is still above 0.0001, so included. Wait, but if n increases beyond 3183, x decreases further, so n=3184 gives x\u22480.0001000067, which is still above 0.0001, so it's included. Wait, but earlier I thought n goes up to 3183, but according to this, n=3184 would also give x just above 0.0001, so maybe my upper bound is wrong. Wait, let me re-examine the initial inequality. I had 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, so n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183. So, n=3183 is included, but n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000067, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's still in the interval. Wait, but according to the inequality, n must be less than 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but 3184 is larger than that, so 3184\u03c0 is larger than 3183.098\u03c0, which would make 1/(3184\u03c0) < 0.0001, but wait, that contradicts our earlier calculation. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inequality direction. Let me go back. We have 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, solving for n:\n\nFrom 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0), we get n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098.\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, we get n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309.\n\nSo, n must be less than approximately 3183.098 and greater than approximately 318.309.\n\nThus, the maximum integer n is 3183, because 3183 < 3183.098, and n=3184 would be 3184 > 3183.098, which would make 1/(3184\u03c0) < 0.0001, which is outside the interval.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation suggested that 3184\u03c0 \u2248 9999.32196, so 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000067, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's still within the interval. Hmm, this seems contradictory. Let me check that calculation again.\n\nWait, 3184 * \u03c0: 3184 * 3.1415926535.\n\nLet me compute 3184 * 3 = 9552.\n\n3184 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3184 * 0.1 = 318.4, 3184 * 0.04 = 127.36, 3184 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 5.065.\n\nAdding those up: 318.4 + 127.36 = 445.76 + 5.065 \u2248 450.825.\n\nSo, total 3184\u03c0 \u2248 9552 + 450.825 \u2248 9999.825.\n\nSo, 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.825 \u2248 0.00010000175, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nBut according to the inequality, n must be less than 3183.098, so n=3183 is allowed, but n=3184 would be n > 3183.098, which would make 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.0001, but our calculation shows that 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010000175 > 0.0001, so it's still in the interval.\n\nWait, perhaps my initial inequality was incorrect. Let me re-express the inequalities correctly.\n\nGiven 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nSo, solving for n:\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001: Multiply both sides by n\u03c0 (positive, so inequality remains the same): 1 > 0.0001 * n\u03c0 => n < 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098.\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001: Multiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 => n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309.\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098.\n\nThus, the maximum integer n is 3183, because 3183 < 3183.098, and n=3184 would be 3184 > 3183.098, which would make 1/(3184\u03c0) < 0.0001, which is outside the interval. But wait, our calculation shows that 1/(3184\u03c0) is approximately 0.00010000175, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's still in the interval. So, there's a contradiction here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inequality direction. Let me think again: if n increases, 1/(n\u03c0) decreases. So, when n=3183, 1/(n\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001000035, which is just over 0.0001. When n=3184, 1/(n\u03c0) is approximately 0.00010000175, which is still over 0.0001. So, n=3184 would still give x in the interval. But according to the inequality, n must be less than 3183.098, so n=3184 is beyond that, which would suggest that 1/(3184\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, but our calculation shows it's still greater. So, perhaps the inequality was misapplied.\n\nWait, let's go back to the inequality:\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, we have n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0).\n\nBut 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098.\n\nSo, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183.\n\nBut when n=3184, 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010000175 > 0.0001, so it's still in the interval. So, this suggests that n can go up to 3184, but according to the inequality, n must be less than 3183.098, which would exclude n=3184.\n\nWait, perhaps the error is that when I solved 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, I should have considered that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0). But 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is equivalent to n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0). So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183. Therefore, n=3184 would give 1/(3184\u03c0) < 0.0001, which would be outside the interval.\n\nBut wait, my calculation suggests otherwise. Let me compute 3184\u03c0 precisely.\n\n3184 * \u03c0 = 3184 * 3.141592653589793.\n\nLet me compute 3184 * 3 = 9552.\n\n3184 * 0.141592653589793 \u2248 Let's compute 3184 * 0.1 = 318.4\n\n3184 * 0.04 = 127.36\n\n3184 * 0.001592653589793 \u2248 3184 * 0.001 = 3.184\n\n3184 * 0.000592653589793 \u2248 Let's compute 3184 * 0.0005 = 1.592\n\n3184 * 0.000092653589793 \u2248 ~0.3 (approximate)\n\nSo, adding up: 3.184 + 1.592 + 0.3 \u2248 5.076\n\nSo, total for 0.141592653589793 is 318.4 + 127.36 = 445.76 + 5.076 \u2248 450.836\n\nThus, total 3184\u03c0 \u2248 9552 + 450.836 \u2248 9999.836\n\nSo, 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.836 \u2248 0.00010000164.\n\nSo, 0.00010000164 is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nTherefore, n=3184 would give x \u2248 0.00010000164, which is in the interval. But according to the inequality, n must be less than 3183.098, which would suggest that n=3184 is too large, making x too small. So, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps my initial approach is flawed. Let me think differently. Instead of using inequalities, maybe I can express n in terms of x.\n\nGiven that x is in (0.0001, 0.001), then 1/x is in (1000, 10000).\n\nBecause 1/0.001 = 1000 and 1/0.0001 = 10000.\n\nSo, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000.\n\nNow, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so n = 1/(x\u03c0).\n\nSince 1/x is between 1000 and 10000, then n = 1/(x\u03c0) is between 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098.\n\nSo, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183.\n\nWait, because 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so the largest integer n is 3183.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that n=3184 would still give x in the interval, but according to this, n must be less than 3183.098, so n=3183 is the maximum.\n\nBut according to the calculation, n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.00010000164, which is just over 0.0001, so it's still in the interval.\n\nSo, perhaps my initial calculation was correct, and n can go up to 3184, but according to the inequality, it's limited to 3183.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial substitution.\n\nLet me consider that 1/x is in (1000, 10000), so n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nThus, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nWhich is approximately 318.309 < n < 3183.098.\n\nSo, n can be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nBut when n=3183, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.65, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000035, which is in the interval.\n\nWhen n=3184, 3184\u03c0 \u2248 9999.836, so 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010000164, which is also in the interval.\n\nWait, but according to the inequality, n must be less than 3183.098, so n=3184 is beyond that, which would suggest that 1/(3184\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, but our calculation shows it's still above.\n\nWait, perhaps the error is that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098.\n\nSo, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183.\n\nBut when n=3184, 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010000164, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's still in the interval.\n\nThis suggests that n can go up to 3184, but according to the inequality, it's limited to 3183.\n\nSo, perhaps the confusion arises because 3183.098 is very close to 3183.1, and n must be less than that, so n=3183 is allowed, but n=3184 is not.\n\nBut wait, 3183.098 is approximately 3183.098, so n=3183 is allowed because 3183 < 3183.098.\n\nBut n=3184 is 3184 > 3183.098, so according to the inequality, 1/(3184\u03c0) < 0.0001, but our calculation shows it's still greater.\n\nWait, perhaps my calculation of 3184\u03c0 is incorrect. Let me compute 3184\u03c0 precisely.\n\nUsing a calculator, 3184 * \u03c0 \u2248 3184 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3184 * 3.1415926535.\n\nLet me compute 3184 * 3 = 9552.\n\n3184 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3184 * 0.1 = 318.4\n\n3184 * 0.04 = 127.36\n\n3184 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 3184 * 0.001 = 3.184\n\n3184 * 0.0005926535 \u2248 3184 * 0.0005 = 1.592\n\n3184 * 0.0000926535 \u2248 ~0.3 (approximate)\n\nAdding up: 3.184 + 1.592 + 0.3 \u2248 5.076\n\nSo, total 3184\u03c0 \u2248 9552 + 318.4 + 127.36 + 5.076 \u2248 9552 + 450.836 \u2248 9999.836.\n\nSo, 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.836 \u2248 0.00010000164, which is indeed greater than 0.0001.\n\nSo, according to this, n=3184 is allowed, but according to the inequality, n must be less than 3183.098, which would suggest that n=3184 is not allowed.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that perhaps the initial approach is missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 10000/\u03c0, but when n=3184, 3184\u03c0 \u2248 9999.836, which is less than 10000, so 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010000164 > 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nSo, perhaps the upper bound for n is not 3183, but 3183.098, which is just under 3184, so n can be up to 3183.\n\nWait, but 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.65, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000035, which is included, and n=3184 gives 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010000164, which is also included.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial approach was wrong, and n can go up to 3183, because 3183.098 is just a bit over 3183, so n=3183 is allowed, but n=3184 is beyond that.\n\nWait, but 3183.098 is approximately 3183.098, so n=3183 is less than that, so allowed, and n=3184 is greater, so not allowed.\n\nBut according to the calculation, n=3184 gives x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.00010000164, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nThis suggests that the initial inequality was incorrect, or perhaps I'm misapplying it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to consider that 1/x must be between 1000 and 10000, so 1000 < 1/x < 10000.\n\nSo, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, where n is integer.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nWhich is approximately 318.309 < n < 3183.098.\n\nSo, n can be from 319 up to 3183.\n\nThus, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nBut wait, according to this, n=3183 is allowed, but n=3184 is not, because 3184 > 3183.098.\n\nBut according to the calculation, n=3184 gives x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.00010000164, which is in the interval.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct upper bound is n=3183, as per the inequality, but according to the calculation, n=3184 is also allowed.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the initial approach was incorrect, and the number of x-intercepts is actually 3183 - 319 +1 +1 = 2866, because n=3184 is also allowed.\n\nWait, but let me think again: 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n must be less than that, so the maximum integer n is 3183.\n\nBut when n=3184, 3184\u03c0 \u2248 9999.836 < 10000, so 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010000164 > 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct upper bound is n=3183, because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.65 < 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000035 > 0.0001, included.\n\nn=3184: 3184\u03c0 \u2248 9999.836 < 10000, so 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010000164 > 0.0001, included.\n\nn=3185: 3185\u03c0 \u2248 3185 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3185 * 3 = 9555, 3185 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3185 * 0.1 = 318.5, 3185 * 0.04 = 127.4, 3185 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 5.08.\n\nAdding up: 318.5 + 127.4 = 445.9 + 5.08 \u2248 450.98.\n\nSo, total 3185\u03c0 \u2248 9555 + 450.98 \u2248 9999.98.\n\nSo, 1/(3185\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.98 \u2248 0.0001000002, which is still greater than 0.0001, so included.\n\nWait, so n=3185 also gives x=1/(3185\u03c0)\u22480.0001000002, which is in the interval.\n\nSimilarly, n=3186: 3186\u03c0 \u2248 3186 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3186 * 3 = 9558, 3186 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3186 * 0.1 = 318.6, 3186 * 0.04 = 127.44, 3186 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 5.09.\n\nAdding up: 318.6 + 127.44 = 446.04 + 5.09 \u2248 451.13.\n\nTotal: 9558 + 451.13 \u2248 10009.13.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 3186 * \u03c0 should be less than 3186 * 3.142 \u2248 3186 * 3 = 9558, 3186 * 0.142 \u2248 452. So, total \u2248 9558 + 452 \u2248 10010, which is over 10000.\n\nWait, but 3186\u03c0 \u2248 10010, which is greater than 10000, so 1/(3186\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009990, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval.\n\nWait, so n=3186 gives x=1/(3186\u03c0)\u22480.00009990 < 0.0001, so it's excluded.\n\nSo, n=3185 gives x\u22480.0001000002 > 0.0001, included.\n\nn=3186 gives x\u22480.00009990 < 0.0001, excluded.\n\nSo, the maximum n is 3185.\n\nBut according to the inequality, n must be less than 3183.098, which would exclude n=3184 and n=3185.\n\nBut according to the calculation, n=3184 and n=3185 give x just over 0.0001, so they're included.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct upper bound is n=3185, because 3185\u03c0 \u2248 9999.98 < 10000, so 1/(3185\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000002 > 0.0001, included.\n\nn=3186: 3186\u03c0 \u2248 10010 > 10000, so 1/(3186\u03c0) < 0.0001, excluded.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct upper bound for n is 3185, not 3183.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing.

Wait, but let me check the initial inequalities again. We had n > 318.309 and n < 3183.098. So, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. And n must be less than 3183.098, so the largest integer n is 3183. So, the integers n run from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. That seems correct. Wait, but let me think about whether each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept. Since sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches zero, but in this interval, x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a small range near zero, but not too close. So, each n gives exactly one x-intercept in that interval, right? Because as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000, so sin(1/x) will oscillate between -1 and 1, crossing zero each time 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0. So, each zero crossing corresponds to a unique n. Therefore, the number of zeros is equal to the number of integers n in the range from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 2865. So, I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me consider if there's any possibility of overlapping or missing any intercepts. For example, could there be two consecutive n's giving the same x? No, because each n gives a distinct x.

So, the number of zeros is equal to the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001). So, n must satisfy 1/(0.001) > n\u03c0 > 1/(0.0001). So, 1000 > n\u03c0 > 10000. Therefore, 1000/\u03c0 > n > 10000/\u03c0. Wait, hold on, that seems conflicting with what I had before. Wait, no, let me re-express the inequalities correctly. The x must be between 0.0001 and 0.001, so 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), then 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities because reciprocals reverse the order for positive numbers):\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nThen, dividing all parts by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nCalculating:\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309\n\n10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098.\n\nSince n must be an integer, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3183 - 319. 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 -19 = 2864. Then, 2864 +1 = 2865.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to n ranging from 319 to 3183. The number of integers in this range is 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"
