Calculating 10000 / \u03c0: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n is an integer, n \u2264 3183. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0. Then, dividing both sides by 0.001: 1000 < n\u03c0. So, n > 1000 / \u03c0. Calculating 1000 / \u03c0: 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618. Since n is an integer, n \u2265 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the values: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 = 2864; 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, let me check that subtraction again. 3183 minus 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2865. So, there are 2865 integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the range of n. Let me verify the calculations step by step again. Starting with x = 1/(n\u03c0), and x must be in (0.0001, 0.001). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and remembering that flipping inequalities when taking reciprocals because all terms are positive), we get: 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing all parts by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618 and less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check if 1/(319\u03c0) is indeed greater than 0.001 and 1/(3183\u03c0) is indeed less than 0.001. Let's compute 1/(319\u03c0): 1/(319 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(1003.044) \u2248 0.00099697, which is just under 0.001. Wait, but 0.00099697 is less than 0.001, so 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099697 < 0.001, which means that x = 1/(319\u03c0) is just below 0.001, so it's within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.098) \u2248 0.000099995, which is just above 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099995, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's within the interval. Therefore, both endpoints are included, so n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, inclusive. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but let me make sure that 1/(319\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Wait, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099697, which is greater than 0.0001, so that's correct. Similarly, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099995, which is less than 0.001, so that's correct. So, the range of n is from 319 to 3183, inclusive. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but let me check that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 is 2865. So, 2865 x-intercepts. Hmm, that seems like a lot, but considering the function oscillates rapidly as x approaches zero, it makes sense that there are many intercepts in that interval. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, which gives x = 1/(n\u03c0). For x in (0.0001, 0.001), n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

    "text": ". Then, dividing both sides by 0.0001\u03c0: n > 1/(0.0001\u03c0). Let me compute that: 1/(0.0001) is 10000, so 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n has to be an integer, n \u2265 3184. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Similarly, multiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0. Then, divide both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618, meaning n \u2265 319. Wait, but from the first inequality, n has to be greater than about 3183, which is much larger than 319. So, the more restrictive condition is n \u2265 3184. Now, I need to find all integers n such that 3184 \u2264 n \u2264 something. Wait, let me check the upper bound again. The upper bound comes from 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which gives n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618. But wait, that's the lower bound for n? Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine. The interval is 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), then for x to be greater than 0.0001, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988618. Similarly, for x < 0.001, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u21d2 n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.30988618. Wait, so I think I mixed up the inequalities earlier. Let me correct that. If x = 1/(n\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001, then 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988618. Similarly, x = 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u21d2 n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must satisfy 318.30988618 < n < 3183.0988618. Since n must be an integer, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. So, the number of integers n in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1. Wait, let me make sure. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I should consider whether n can be 3183. Let me see: n must be less than 3183.0988618, so the maximum integer n is 3183. Similarly, n must be greater than 318.30988618, so the minimum integer n is 319. So, the count is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me think again. Each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept, right? Because for each integer n, there's a unique x = 1/(n\u03c0) in the interval. So, the number of such x's is equal to the number of integers n in that range. So, yes, 2865. I think that's correct. Let me just check with an example. Suppose I take n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1004.133) \u2248 0.000996, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. For n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.000) \u2248 0.0001, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, this would be at x \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so n must be less than 3183.0988618, so n can be 3183 because 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 1/(3183 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000.000) exactly, because 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so n must be less than 3183.0988618, so n can be up to 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is not included in the interval. So, actually, n must be less than 3183.0988618, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is equal to 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.0988618, so n can be up to 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is not included. So, does that mean n can go up to 3183, but x is just above 0.0001? Wait, no, because n must satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n can be up to 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is not included. So, does that mean n can be up to 3183, but x would be just above 0.0001? Wait, but n has to be an integer, so n can be 3183, but then x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is not in the interval. So, actually, n must be less than 3183.0988618, so n can be up to 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. Wait, that would mean n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Let me check: n = 3182: x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.000 - \u03c0) \u2248 slightly more than 0.0001, which is included in the interval. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine.\n\nWhen solving 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, we get n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n can be up to 3183, but n must be less than 3183.0988618, so the maximum integer n is 3183. However, when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 exactly, which is not included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n must be less than 3183.0988618, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3183, but x is just above 0.0001, so it's included. Wait, no, because n = 3183 gives x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001. So, n = 3183 gives x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is not included. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because n = 3182 gives x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010003, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 3182 - 319 = 2863 + 1 = 2864. Wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by including n = 3183, but actually, n must be less than 3183.0988618, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 3182 - 319 = 2863 + 1 = 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought n can go up to 3183, but now I'm getting 3182. Let me verify with actual computation. Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0). Let's compute 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.14 \u2248 445.62, so total \u2248 9549 + 445.62 \u2248 9994.62. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9994.62 \u2248 0.000100054, which is just over 0.0001. Wait, but 0.0001 is 10^(-4), so 0.000100054 is greater than 0.0001, so x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100054, which is greater than 0.0001, so it is included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier thought. So, perhaps n can be up to 3183, because x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100054, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. So, n can be 3183. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, making the number of integers 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that's correct. Because 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 9994.62, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100054, which is indeed greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100054, which is indeed in (0.0001, 0.001). So, n can go up to 3183. Therefore, the count is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that's the number of x-intercepts.\n\nBut wait, let me check the other end. For n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1004.133) \u2248 0.000996, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183, inclusive. So, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that's the answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 -19 = 2864, then add 1: 2865. So, yes, 2865.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n gives 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

Similarly, for the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, divide both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) Let's compute that: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) is 1000/\u03c0. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Now, I need to find all integers n such that 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me calculate the approximate values of 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n can take integer values starting from the next integer after 318.309886184, which is 319, up to the integer just below 3183.09886184, which is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, substituting a = 319 and b = 3183, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Each of these n corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2865. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 1000/\u03c0 is approximately 318.31, so n must be greater than that, so n starts at 319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 is approximately 3183.098, so n goes up to 3183. Then, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then minus 19 is 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct. So, I think my answer is 2865 x-intercepts. But just to be thorough, let me consider whether each n in that range gives a unique x in the interval. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), and n is increasing, x is decreasing as n increases. So, each n corresponds to a unique x in the interval, and all those x's are within (0.0001, 0.001). So, yes, each n from 319 to 3183 gives a distinct x-intercept in the interval.

Since n must be an integer, the maximum integer n can be is 3183. Now, let's look at the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by 0.001: 1000 < n\u03c0. Then, dividing both sides by \u03c0: n > 1000 / \u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.3098861. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.3098861. Since n is an integer, the smallest integer n can be is 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can compute 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n in that range. Each of these n corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, when I calculated 10000 / \u03c0, I got approximately 3183.098861, which is correct because \u03c0 * 3183 \u2248 10000. Similarly, 1000 / \u03c0 is approximately 318.3098861, which also checks out. Then, subtracting 319 from 3183 gives 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct. So, yes, the number of x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need to find how many such x lie between 0.0001 and 0.001. Solving 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 gives n between approximately 318.31 and 3183.09. Thus, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, yielding 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

Similarly, for the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0. Then, dividing both sides by 0.001: 1000 < n\u03c0. So, n > 1000 / \u03c0. Now, let me compute 1000 / \u03c0 and 10000 / \u03c0 to find the range of n. Since \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, let me calculate: 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183. Now, to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, no, actually, since n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, the number of integers is 3183 - 318 = 2865, but wait, that's not right because 319 - 318 = 1, so actually, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when dealing with inequalities, especially with reciprocals, it's easy to make a mistake. So, let's go through it again. We have x in (0.0001, 0.001), which means 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), substituting gives 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let's invert the inequalities, remembering that inverting reverses the inequality signs. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. That is, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing each part by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which is the same as before. So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. Therefore, the smallest integer n is 319 and the largest is 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, that seems correct. But wait, let me check if n=3183 is included. Since 3183 < 3183.09886184, yes, it's included because 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 10000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000, which is the upper bound. Therefore, 3183 is included. Similarly, n=319: 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.14159265 \u2248 1002. So, 1002 > 1000, so 319 is included. Therefore, the number of integers is indeed 3183 - 318 = 2865, but wait, 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, let me check that again. If I have numbers from a to b inclusive, the count is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, so that's 2865 integers. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the subtraction. Let me compute 3183 minus 319. Let's see: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. So, 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n from 319 to 3183, inclusive.

Solving for n, I correctly found that n must be between approximately 318.309 and 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, 2865 intercepts. That seems correct. I don't think I made any calculation errors here.

Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. So, 3183 - 319 is indeed 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider the endpoints. When n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0). Let's compute that value to ensure it's greater than 0.001. Wait, 319\u03c0 is approximately 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 1002. So, 1/(1002) \u2248 0.000998, which is just less than 0.001. Wait, that's a problem because our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) must be less than 0.001 and greater than 0.0001. Wait, so when n = 319, x \u2248 0.000998, which is less than 0.001, so that's okay. But when n = 318, x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.0) = 0.001, which is exactly 0.001. But our interval is open, so x must be less than 0.001, so n = 318 would give x = 0.001, which is not included. So, the smallest n is indeed 319, as 318 gives x = 0.001, which is excluded.\n\nSimilarly, when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, but our interval is x > 0.0001, so n = 3183 gives x = 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the largest n is 3182, because 3182\u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 9999.999, so 1/(9999.999) \u2248 0.0001000001, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. Wait, that seems conflicting with my earlier calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, if n = 3183, then x = 1/(3183\u03c0). Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0. 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's see: 3000 * 3.1416 = 9424.8, 183 * 3.1416 \u2248 183 * 3 = 549, 183 * 0.1416 \u2248 25.94, so total \u2248 549 + 25.94 = 574.94, so total 9424.8 + 574.94 \u2248 9999.74. So, x = 1/9999.74 \u2248 0.0001000025, which is just above 0.0001. So, x = 0.0001000025 is in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n = 3183 is included. But earlier, when I calculated 10,000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n must be less than 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, as 3183 is less than 3183.098. So, n = 3183 is allowed.\n\nBut wait, when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000025, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. Therefore, n can go up to 3183.\n\nBut earlier, when I calculated the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I got 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Let me check that again.\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers is (3183 - 319) + 1 = 2865.\n\nBut wait, let me check with a smaller example to see if this formula works. Suppose I have numbers from 5 to 10 inclusive. The count should be 10 - 5 + 1 = 6 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9,10. That works. So, yes, the formula is correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When n increases, x decreases because x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, as n increases from 319 to 3183, x decreases from approximately 0.000998 to 0.0001000025. So, each n corresponds to a unique x in the interval, and since n is an integer, each n gives exactly one x-intercept. Therefore, the total number is indeed 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check the endpoints again. For n = 319, x \u2248 0.000998, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. For n = 3183, x \u2248 0.0001000025, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. So, both endpoints are included, so the count is correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. Within the interval (0.0001, 0.001), we find the range of n by solving 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. This gives n between 319 and 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

Similarly, for the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, dividing both sides by 0.001: 1000 < n\u03c0 => n > 1000 / \u03c0. So, combining both inequalities, we have: 1000 / \u03c0 < n < 10000 / \u03c0 Now, let me compute these values numerically. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, let's calculate 1000 / \u03c0: 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, n can take integer values starting from the next integer after 318.309886184, which is 319, up to the integer just below 3183.09886184, which is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183. To find the number of integers between two numbers a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, applying that here: Number of integers = 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait a minute, let me double-check that. I think I might have made a mistake in the number of integers. Let me recount. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is indeed b - a + 1. So, a is 319, b is 3183. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 is 2865. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of it as starting from 1, up to 3183, which is 3183 numbers, and subtracting the numbers from 1 to 318, which is 318 numbers. So, 3183 - 318 = 2865. Yep, that matches.

Since \u03c0 is approximately 3.14159, 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.14159 \u2248 3183.098. So, n > approximately 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n \u2265 3184. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) Let me compute that: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) is 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.14159 \u2248 318.309. So, n > approximately 318.309, meaning n \u2265 319. Wait, that doesn't make sense because from the first inequality, n must be greater than approximately 3183.098, which is much larger than 319. So, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the inequalities. Let me double-check. The interval is 0.0001 < x < 0.001, and x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, I need 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me solve for n in each inequality separately. Starting with the left inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) => 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001 => n\u03c0 < 10000 => n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.098, meaning n \u2264 3183. Now, the right inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n\u03c0 > 1/0.001 => n\u03c0 > 1000 => n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309, meaning n \u2265 319. Therefore, combining both inequalities, n must satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers n are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between a and b inclusive, it's b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Wait, but let me check that calculation again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, so adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, but wait, let me verify if both endpoints are included. Since n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183, including both, the count is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But wait, let me think again. Each n corresponds to a unique x in that interval, right? Because for each n, x = 1/(n\u03c0), and as n increases, x decreases. So, n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.3) \u2248 0.0009967, which is just below 0.001. Similarly, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, which is just above 0.0001. So, each n from 319 to 3183 gives an x in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make an error in the subtraction. 3183 minus 319: Let's compute 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. So, yes, 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integers n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n gives 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.14159265, so 10,000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618.

Since n is an integer, the smallest n can be is 319.\n\nSo, putting it all together, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, that means there are 2865 x-intercepts in that interval.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. So, 10,000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 3183.098, so the largest integer n is 3183. Then, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. Then, the count is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me verify that subtraction: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more to get 2864, then add 1 to get 2865. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the number of terms in the sequence from n = 319 to n = 3183 is 3183 - 319 + 1. Yeah, that formula is correct because when you subtract the starting point from the endpoint, you get the number of steps between them, and then you add 1 to include both endpoints.\n\nJust to double-check, let me pick a smaller example. Suppose I wanted the number of integers from 2 to 5. That's 2,3,4,5, which is 4 numbers. Using the formula: 5 - 2 + 1 = 4. So, yes, that works.

Let's compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then +1 gives 2865. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, 3183 - 319 is actually 2864?

Let me check for n=319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.07) \u2248 0.0009969, which is just below 0.001, so it's in the interval. For n=3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, but since the interval is open at 0.0001, x must be greater than 0.0001.

But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, x must be greater than 0.0001. So, x=0.0001 is not included. Therefore, n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. So, perhaps n should be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is not in the interval. So, maybe n should go up to 3182 instead.

Let me compute 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's see, 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77, 182\u03c0 \u2248 571.89, so total \u2248 9424.77 + 571.89 \u2248 10,000. So, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. So, x \u2248 0.0001, which is still on the boundary. Since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so n=3182 gives x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but slightly more, because 3182\u03c0 is slightly less than 10,000, so 1/(3182\u03c0) is slightly more than 0.0001. Wait, no, if 3182\u03c0 is less than 10,000, then 1/(3182\u03c0) is more than 0.0001. Hmm, let me compute 3182 * \u03c0 more accurately.\n\nCompute 3182 * \u03c0:\n\nFirst, \u03c0 \u2248 3.1415926535.\n\n3182 * 3 = 9546\n\n3182 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 3182 * 0.1 = 318.2\n\n3182 * 0.04 = 127.28\n\n3182 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 approximately 3182 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0912\n\nSo, adding up: 318.2 + 127.28 = 445.48 + 5.0912 \u2248 450.5712\n\nSo total 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9546 + 450.5712 \u2248 9996.5712\n\nSo, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.5712 \u2248 0.000100034. Wait, that's just over 0.0001. So, x \u2248 0.000100034, which is just above 0.0001, so it is included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n=3182 gives x\u22480.000100034, which is inside the interval. Then, n=3183: 3183\u03c0 \u2248 3182\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2248 9996.5712 + 3.1416 \u2248 10000 - 0.3284 \u2248 9999.6728?

So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.7128, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.7128 \u2248 0.0001000028. Hmm, which is still just over 0.0001. Wait, but 3183\u03c0 is approximately 9999.7128, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001000028, which is just over 0.0001. So, x=0.0001000028 is in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 is acceptable.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, I got n > 318.309, so n starts at 319. And for the lower bound, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which gave n < 3183.098, so n up to 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nWait, 3183 - 319 is 2864, then +1 is 2865. So, 2865 x-intercepts. But let me check n=319: 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.07) \u2248 0.0009969, which is just under 0.001, so it's in the interval. And n=3183: 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000028, which is just over 0.0001, so also in the interval. So, both ends are included, so the count is correct as 2865.\n\nWait, but let me make sure about the exactness. Because sometimes when dealing with inequalities, especially with approximations, you might include or exclude an endpoint incorrectly. Let me think again.\n\nWe have x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, x must satisfy 0.0001 < x < 0.001.\n\nGiven x = 1/(n\u03c0), then:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing all parts by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nCompute 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098861\n\nCompute 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098861\n\nSince n must be an integer, n must satisfy:\n\nn > 318.3098861 => n \u2265 319\n\nn < 3183.098861 => n \u2264 3183\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nCompute 3183 - 319:\n\n3183 - 300 = 2883\n\n2883 - 19 = 2864\n\nThen, 2864 + 1 = 2865.\n\nSo, there are 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me check with specific values to make sure. For example, n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009969 < 0.001, so included.\n\nn=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000028 > 0.0001, so included.\n\nn=3184: x=1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3184 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000.000...) which is exactly 0.0001, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so n=3184 would give x=0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, n cannot be 3184, so n goes up to 3183.\n\nSimilarly, n=318: x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.000...) which is 0.001, but the interval is open at 0.001, so x must be less than 0.001, so n=318 gives x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009999, which is less than 0.001, but wait, 318\u03c0 \u2248 1000.000...? Wait, 318 * \u03c0 \u2248 318 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's compute 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477, 18\u03c0 \u2248 56.548, so total \u2248 942.477 + 56.548 \u2248 999.025. So, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/999.025 \u2248 0.001000975, which is just over 0.001. So, x=0.001000975 is greater than 0.001, so it's excluded from the interval. Therefore, n=318 gives x just over 0.001, which is excluded, so n must start at 319.\n\nSo, n=319 gives x\u22480.0009969, which is less than 0.001, so included.\n\nTherefore, the range is correct: n from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me compute 3183 - 319 again to be sure.\n\n3183 - 300 = 2883\n\n2883 - 19 = 2864\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 2864 + 1 = 2865.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098\n\nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

Since n must be an integer, n \u2265 3184. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) Let me calculate that: 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184. Again, since n is an integer, n \u2265 319. Wait, hold on, that seems conflicting. Because from the first inequality, n must be greater than ~3183, and from the second inequality, n must be greater than ~318.3. But since we're looking for x in (0.0001, 0.001), and x = 1/(n\u03c0), as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, n decreases from ~3183 to ~318. So, actually, n starts at 3184 and goes down to 319. But n must be an integer, so n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. Wait, no, because when x increases, n decreases because x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, when x is 0.0001, n is approximately 3183, and when x is 0.001, n is approximately 318. So, the values of n that satisfy 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 are integers from 319 up to 3183. So, how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive? To find the number of integers, we subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 = 2864; 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers in that range. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check my inequalities. When x is in (0.0001, 0.001), 1/x is in (1000, 10000). So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. So, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n must be in (1000/\u03c0, 10000/\u03c0). Calculating those: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.

Starting with 1000 < n\u03c0: Divide both sides by \u03c0: n > 1000 / \u03c0 Similarly, n\u03c0 < 10000: Divide both sides by \u03c0: n < 10000 / \u03c0 So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 and less than 10000/\u03c0. Let me calculate these values numerically to find the range of n. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n can take integer values starting from the next integer after 318.309886184, which is 319, up to the integer just below 3183.09886184, which is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers in this range, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Each of these n corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0) within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, that should be the number of x-intercepts. Wait, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, the substitution: x = 1/(n\u03c0) is correct because sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). Then, substituting into the interval 0.0001 < x < 0.001, we get 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which leads to 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, correct. Then, solving for n, n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so the smallest integer n is 319, and n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so the largest integer n is 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. I don't think I made a mistake here.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is an open interval, so we're not including the endpoints. But since x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0), and 1/(n\u03c0) can't be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001 because those would require n to be 10000/\u03c0 or 1000/\u03c0, which aren't integers. So, all the x-intercepts are strictly inside the interval, so we don't have to worry about endpoints. Therefore, 2865 is the correct number of x-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we determine when \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\).

Let me calculate that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.098861. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.098861. Since n must be an integer, the maximum possible n is 3183. Now, let's look at the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, multiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0. Then, divide both sides by 0.001: 1000 < n\u03c0. So, n > 1000 / \u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.3098861. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.3098861. Since n must be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183, inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Let's compute that: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me do the subtraction first: 3183 - 319. 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then minus 19 is 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of terms in this sequence is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more is 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 is 2865. That seems correct. So, yeah, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nSolving for n:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nApproximately:\n\n318.31 < n < 3183.09\n\nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive.

    "text": ". Then, dividing both sides by 0.0001\u03c0: n < 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) Let me compute 1/(0.0001\u03c0). 0.0001 is 10^-4, so 1/10^-4 is 10^4, which is 10000. So, 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0. Similarly, for the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) Again, 0.001 is 10^-3, so 1/0.001 is 1000. Therefore, 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0. So now, n must satisfy: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0 Since n has to be an integer, the number of integers between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0 will give me the number of x-intercepts. Let me compute these values numerically. First, \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, applying that here: Number of integers = 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 = 2864; 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. So, 3183 - 319: Let's compute 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me think again about whether n starts at 319 or 318. Because 1000/\u03c0 is approximately 318.309886184, so the next integer n is 319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 is approximately 3183.09886184, so the largest integer n is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, that would mean there are 2865 x-intercepts. But wait, that seems like a lot. Let me think again. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches zero. So, between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a very small interval near zero, the function oscillates infinitely many times, but since we're dealing with a finite interval, even though it's very small, the number of oscillations is finite. But according to my calculation, it's 2865. Hmm, that seems plausible, but let me check if I did everything correctly.\n\nWait a second, I think I made a mistake in setting up the inequalities. Let me go back. The original interval is (0.0001, 0.001). So, x is between 0.0001 and 0.001. Therefore, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. Therefore, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0, so 1/x = n\u03c0, which implies x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, x must be in (0.0001, 0.001), so 1/(n\u03c0) must be in (0.0001, 0.001). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which is equivalent to 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which is what I had before. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, giving 2865 integers. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the endpoints. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. So, does that affect the count? Let me see. If x approaches 0.0001 from the right, 1/x approaches 10000 from the left. Similarly, as x approaches 0.001 from the left, 1/x approaches 1000 from the right. So, the values of n must satisfy 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, n must be less than 10000/\u03c0 and greater than 1000/\u03c0. Since n must be an integer, the smallest n is 319, and the largest n is 3183. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. But I'm a bit surprised by the large number. Let me check with a smaller interval to see if the method works. Suppose I take the interval (0.01, 0.1). Then, 1/x would be between 10 and 100. So, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so n\u03c0 must be between 10 and 100. So, n must be between 10/\u03c0 \u2248 3.183 and 100/\u03c0 \u2248 31.83. So, n ranges from 4 to 31, inclusive. The number of integers is 31 - 4 + 1 = 28. Let me compute that with the formula: 31 - 4 = 27, plus 1 is 28. So, that seems correct. So, in that case, the number of x-intercepts is 28, which seems reasonable. Similarly, for the interval (0.001, 0.01), 1/x is between 100 and 1000. So, n must be between 100/\u03c0 \u2248 31.83 and 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31. So, n ranges from 32 to 318, inclusive. The number of integers is 318 - 32 + 1 = 287. So, 287 x-intercepts. That seems correct as well. So, scaling up, for (0.0001, 0.001), which is 10 times smaller in x, so 1/x is 10 times larger, from 1000 to 10000. So, the number of x-intercepts would be roughly 10 times the previous interval's count. Wait, but in the previous case, from (0.001, 0.01), which is 10 times larger in x, the count was 287. So, from (0.0001, 0.001), which is 10 times smaller in x, the count is 2865, which is roughly 10 times 287, which is 2870, close to 2865. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, I think my calculation is correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Solving for x gives x = 1/(n\u03c0). For x in (0.0001, 0.001), 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. Thus, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, leading to n between approximately 318.31 and 3183.09. The integers n range from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

The x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, x must be between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let's invert the inequalities, remembering that inverting reverses the inequality signs. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. That gives 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Then, dividing all parts by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating those: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098862, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098861. So, n must be greater than 318.3098862 and less than 3183.098861. Since n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. So, 2865 x-intercepts. But wait, let me think about whether this is accurate. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches zero. So, between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a very small interval near zero, the function is oscillating rapidly. Each oscillation corresponds to a half-period, so each zero crossing is half a period apart. Wait, actually, the period of sin(1/x) is 2\u03c0/(1/x) = 2\u03c0x, but as x approaches zero, the period becomes very small. So, the number of zeros in the interval should be roughly the number of periods in that interval. Alternatively, the number of zeros can be approximated by integrating the density of zeros, but in this case, since we can directly compute it via the n values, I think the initial approach is correct. So, the number of zeros is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. We need to find n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.

Since n has to be an integer, the maximum possible n is 3183. Now, let's look at the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0. Then, dividing both sides by 0.001: 1000 < n\u03c0. So, n > 1000 / \u03c0. Calculating 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.3098861. Since n must be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319.

Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 10000 / \u03c0 is approximately 3183.098861, so n must be less than that, so the maximum integer n is 3183. Then, 1000 / \u03c0 is approximately 318.3098861, so the smallest integer n is 319. Then, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more to get 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865.

Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.14159265, so 10000 / 3.14159265 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.098. Since n is an integer, n \u2264 3183.

Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 10000 / \u03c0 is approximately 3183.098, so n must be less than that, so the maximum integer n is 3183. Similarly, 1000 / \u03c0 is approximately 318.3098, so the minimum integer n is 319. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1.

Then, dividing both sides by 0.0001\u03c0: n < 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) Similarly, for the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) So, putting it together: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) < n < 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) Let me compute these values. First, 1 / (0.001\u03c0). 0.001 is 10^(-3), so 1 / 0.001 is 1000. Therefore, 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 1 / (0.0001\u03c0). 0.0001 is 10^(-4), so 1 / 0.0001 is 10000. Therefore, 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) = 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must satisfy 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n can take integer values from the next integer after 318.309886184, which is 319, up to the integer before 3183.09886184, which is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers in this range, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, number of integers = 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me check the calculation again. 3183 - 319: Let's compute 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, but wait, let me confirm if n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, so the count is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Alternatively, another way to compute the number of integers between a and b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me think again. Each x-intercept corresponds to a unique n, so each integer n in that range gives a unique x in the interval. So, yes, 2865 intercepts. But wait, I should check if n=319 gives x just above 0.001, and n=3183 gives x just below 0.0001, but actually, since we're dealing with x between 0.0001 and 0.001, let me check the endpoints. For n=319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.08) \u2248 0.000997, which is approximately 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so that's within the interval. For n=3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.000...) which is 0.0001, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since 0.0001 is excluded, we need to check if n=3183 gives x just above 0.0001. Let's compute 1/(3183\u03c0). Since \u03c0 \u2248 3.1415926535, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 10000.000... approximately. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but it's just slightly less than 0.0001 because 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000. Wait, no, 3183 * \u03c0 is exactly 10000 when n=3183, but since \u03c0 is irrational, it's actually 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.000..., but not exactly. Wait, let me compute 3183 * \u03c0 more accurately. Let me compute 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let's compute 3000\u03c0 = 9424.77796077, 183\u03c0 = 183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 574.74634724. So, total is 9424.77796077 + 574.74634724 \u2248 9999.52430801. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.52430801, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.52430801 \u2248 0.00010000476. So, that's approximately 0.00010000476, which is just slightly above 0.0001. Therefore, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010000476, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, for n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.08) \u2248 0.00099695, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Therefore, both n=319 and n=3183 correspond to x in the interval. Thus, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but let me double-check that subtraction. 3183 minus 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864, then add 1: 2865. Yes, that's correct. So, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But wait, let me think again. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. So, between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a small interval, the function oscillates rapidly. Each oscillation corresponds to a period, and each period has two x-intercepts (except possibly at the endpoints). So, perhaps another way to think about it is to find how many periods of sin(1/x) are in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). The period of sin(1/x) is 2\u03c0, but since the function is sin(1/x), the period in terms of x is not straightforward. Alternatively, we can think about how many times 1/x increases by 2\u03c0 as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001. Let me try that approach. Let\u2019s consider t = 1/x. When x is in (0.0001, 0.001), t is in (1000, 10000). So, t ranges from 1000 to 10000. The function becomes y = sin(t). The x-intercepts of sin(t) occur at t = n\u03c0, where n is an integer. So, t must be in (1000, 10000). Therefore, n\u03c0 must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let's compute these: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, just as before. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, this confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me think again: each time t increases by \u03c0, sin(t) crosses zero. So, from t=1000 to t=10000, the number of zeros is the number of times t crosses n\u03c0 in that interval. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which is the same as n between 319 and 3183, as we found. So, yes, 2865 zeros. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. For x in (0.0001, 0.001), t = 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. The number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000 is from n=319 to n=3183, giving 2865 intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

Similarly, compute 1 / (0.0001\u03c0): 0.0001 is 10^-4, so 1/(10^-4 * \u03c0) = 10^4 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must satisfy: 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, n can take integer values from the next integer greater than 318.309886184, which is 319, up to the integer less than 3183.09886184, which is 3183. Now, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, no, actually, it's from 319 to 3183, so the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Each of these n corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 1/(0.001\u03c0) is approximately 318.309886184, so the smallest integer n is 319. Similarly, 1/(0.0001\u03c0) is approximately 3183.09886184, so the largest integer n is 3183. Now, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integers n. Solving for x gives x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098\n\nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

Dividing all parts by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0 Calculating these values. Let's approximate \u03c0 as 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, we can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1. Wait, no, let me think again. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait a second, let me verify if I did that correctly. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. So, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Yes, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, let me check with a smaller example. Suppose n starts at 3 and ends at 5. Then, the numbers are 3,4,5. The count is 3, which is 5 - 3 + 1 = 3. So, that formula works. So, in our case, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Hmm, but let me make sure that x = 1/(n\u03c0) is indeed within (0.0001, 0.001). So, when n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.05) \u2248 0.000997, which is approximately 0.001, but just slightly less. Wait, but 0.000997 is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Similarly, when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, which is exactly 0.0001, but since the interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), does that include x = 0.0001 or x = 0.001? No, it's open, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but since it's open, we need to check if x is greater than 0.0001. Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0): 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's compute 3000 * 3.1416 = 9424.8, 183 * 3.1416 \u2248 183 * 3 = 549, 183 * 0.1416 \u2248 25.95, so total \u2248 549 + 25.95 \u2248 574.95. So, total \u2248 9424.8 + 574.95 \u2248 9999.75. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.75 \u2248 0.0001000025. So, that's just over 0.0001. But our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001. Therefore, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000025 is just barely above 0.0001, so it's included. Similarly, when n = 319, x \u2248 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1003.05 \u2248 0.00099697, which is less than 0.001, so it's included as well. Therefore, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive give x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, the total number is 2865. Wait, but let me check if n=3183 is included. Because 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000025, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Similarly, n=3184 would give x = 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0 * \u03c0/3183) Wait, actually, 3184\u03c0 \u2248 3184 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's see, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.75, so 3184\u03c0 \u2248 9999.75 + \u03c0 \u2248 9999.75 + 3.1416 \u2248 10002.8916. So, 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/10002.8916 \u2248 0.00009997, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, n=3183 is the last n that gives x just above 0.0001, so it's included. So, our count from 319 to 3183 is correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The function y = sin(1/x) has zeros at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. We need to find how many such x lie between 0.0001 and 0.001. Solving for n, we find n must be between approximately 318.31 and 3183.098, so n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers in that range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.

Let me calculate that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.098861. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.098861.

The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the numbers: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Wait, let me check that again. 3183 minus 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 is 2865. So, there are 2865 integers in that range. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Sometimes when dealing with inequalities, especially with reciprocals, it's easy to get the direction wrong. Let me double-check the substitution. So, when x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, 1/x is in (1000, 10000). Therefore, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). Therefore, 1/(n\u03c0) must be between 0.0001 and 0.001, which means 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so n must be between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.31 and 3183.09. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me consider if both endpoints are included. Since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, does that affect the count? Because x must be strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. So, x = 1/(n\u03c0) must satisfy 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which leads to n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31 and n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09. So, n can be 319, 320, ..., 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 318 = 2865. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, 2883 - 19 is 2864, so 2864 +1 = 2865. So, yes, 2865. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the number of zeros of sin(1/x) between x = 0.0001 and x = 0.001. Since 1/x is a rapidly increasing function as x approaches 0, the zeros of sin(1/x) occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for each integer n. So, the number of zeros in the interval (a, b) is equal to the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (a, b). Which is exactly what I did earlier. So, I think my approach is correct.\n\nJust to make sure, let me consider a smaller interval to test. Suppose I take (0.1, 0.2). Then 1/x would be between 5 and 10. So, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, n must satisfy 5 < n\u03c0 < 10. So, n must be between 5/\u03c0 \u2248 1.59 and 10/\u03c0 \u2248 3.18. So, n can be 2 and 3. Thus, two x-intercepts. So, the number is 3 - 2 + 1 = 2. That seems correct. So, applying the same logic, my method works. So, in the given problem, the number is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0 for integers n. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. Thus, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, leading to n between approximately 318.31 and 3183.09. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

Similarly, for the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Dividing both sides by 0.001: 1000 < n\u03c0. So, combining both inequalities: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Now, I can solve for n by dividing all parts by \u03c0. Since \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, let's compute the bounds: Lower bound: 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Upper bound: 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, n starts from the next integer after 318.309886184, which is 319, and goes up to the integer just below 3183.09886184, which is 3183. Now, to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, let's compute that: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's calculate 3183 - 319 first. 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Each of these n corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0) within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, lower bound: 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so n starts at 319. Upper bound: 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so n ends at 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. Yep, that seems correct.

So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. To find n, I can divide all parts by \u03c0. Let me compute \u03c0 first. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, dividing 1000 by \u03c0: 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184.

Wait, actually, let me correct that. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that. 3183 - 319 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, the substitution: x = 1/(n\u03c0). Then, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n\u03c0 < 10000, and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n\u03c0 > 1000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Then, dividing by \u03c0, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be greater than 318.31 and less than 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, add 1: 2865. So, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check if 3183 is included. Since 3183.098 is the upper limit, and n must be less than that, so the maximum integer n is 3183 because 3183 < 3183.098. So, yes, n can be 3183. Similarly, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. Therefore, the count is correct at 2865. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check if I might have missed any edge cases. For example, does x = 1/(n\u03c0) exactly equal 0.0001 or 0.001 for some integer n? Let me check: 1/(n\u03c0) = 0.0001 implies n = 1/(0.0001 * \u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) = 0.001 implies n = 1/(0.001 * \u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184. So, since n must be an integer, 3183.09886184 is not an integer, so 1/(3183.09886184 * \u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since n must be an integer, the closest n is 3183, which gives x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 just a bit less than 0.0001. Similarly, n = 318 would give x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 just a bit more than 0.001. But since our interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), we don't include the endpoints. So, x = 1/(318\u03c0) is approximately 0.001003, which is just outside the upper bound, and x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0000999, which is just outside the lower bound. Therefore, the first n that gives x just above 0.0001 is n = 319, and the last n that gives x just below 0.001 is n = 3183. So, the count from 319 to 3183 inclusive is correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but another way to think about this is the number of times 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0 as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001. Each time 1/x passes through n\u03c0, we get an x-intercept. So, the number of times this happens is the number of integers n between 1000 and 10000, but wait, no, that's not quite accurate. Wait, let me clarify. Since x is in (0.0001, 0.001), then 1/x is in (1000, 10000). So, 1/x ranges from just above 1000 to just below 10000. So, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which is the same as before. So, n must be integers where n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 and n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, as before. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that confirms it again.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the arithmetic. So, 3183 minus 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, add 1: 2865. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the number of x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\). This occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for some integer \\( n \\), which implies \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n\nWe need \\( x \\) to be in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\). Therefore, we have:\n\\[ 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\]\n\nRewriting these inequalities to solve for \\( n \\):\n\\[ 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\implies n\\pi < 10000 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\implies n\\pi > 1000 \\]\n\nThus, we have:\n\\[ 1000 < n\\pi < 10000 \\]\n\nDividing by \\( \\pi \\) (approximately 3.1415926535):\n\\[ \\frac{1000}{\\pi} \\approx 318.309886184 < n < \\frac{10000}{\\pi} \\approx 3183.09886184 \\]\n\nThe integers \\( n \\) must satisfy:\n\\[ 319 \\leq n \\leq 3183 \\]\n\nThe number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is:\n\\[ 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 \\]\n\nThus, the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts is \\(\\boxed{2865}\\)."

    "text": ". Then, dividing both sides by 0.0001: n\u03c0 < 1 / 0.0001. Calculating 1 / 0.0001, which is 10000. So, n\u03c0 < 10000, which means n < 10000 / \u03c0. Similarly, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0. Then, dividing both sides by 0.001: 1000 < n\u03c0. So, n > 1000 / \u03c0. Now, let's compute the numerical values of these to find the range of n. First, 1000 / \u03c0: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. But n has to be an integer because it's in the equation 1/x = n\u03c0, so n must be an integer. Therefore, n must satisfy the inequality: 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184. Since n is an integer, the smallest integer greater than 318.309886184 is 319, and the largest integer less than 3183.09886184 is 3183. So, n can take integer values from 319 up to 3183. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, no, actually, 319 is the starting point, so the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Each of these n values corresponds to an x-intercept in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so n must be greater than that, so the smallest integer n is 319. Similarly, 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so the largest integer n is 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319 first: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, yes, that seems correct. So, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) crosses the x-axis whenever 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. To find the number of such x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), we determine the range of n:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001  \n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000  \n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0  \n\nCalculating these bounds:  \n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31  \n10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.10  \n\nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"
