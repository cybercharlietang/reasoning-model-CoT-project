So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.6894 \u2248 0.0001000031. So, 0.0001000031 is just slightly above 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, for n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 1003.5, so 1/1003.5 \u2248 0.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so it's included as well. Therefore, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive are valid, giving x in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me just think about this again: when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. When n=3183, x\u22480.000100003, which is greater than 0.0001, so included. So, the count is correct as 2865.

So, x = 0.00010000314 is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, for n=319, let's compute 319\u03c0: 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477796 19\u03c0 \u2248 59.6902604 319\u03c0 \u2248 942.477796 + 59.6902604 \u2248 1002.168056 So, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.168056 \u2248 0.00099784, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, both n=319 and n=3183 give x within the interval. Therefore, the count is indeed 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Wait, but let me think again: when n increases, x decreases. So, for each integer n from 319 up to 3183, we get a unique x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, the total number of such n is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's the answer. But just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me go through the steps again. 1. The function y = sin(1/x) has zeros where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). 2. We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. 3. Solving for n: 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0). 4. Calculating 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309, so n > 318.309, so n starts at 319. 5. Calculating 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so n < 3183.098, so n ends at 3183. 6. Number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nBut wait, another thought: the function sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely as x approaches 0, but in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a finite interval, the number of oscillations should be finite. So, the count being 2865 seems plausible, but let me just make sure that the range of n is correct.\n\nWait, 1/(0.0001\u03c0) is 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n must be less than that, so n=3183 is the largest integer. Similarly, 1/(0.001\u03c0) is 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n must be greater than that, so n=319 is the smallest integer. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the answer is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

So, that's just a bit over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, for n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477796 19\u03c0 \u2248 59.69026042 942.477796 + 59.69026042 \u2248 1002.168056 So, 319\u03c0 \u2248 1002.168056, so 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099786, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Therefore, both n=319 and n=3183 give x within the interval, so they are both included. Therefore, the count from n=319 to n=3183 inclusive is correct. So, number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Wait, but let me check the arithmetic again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 is 2865. Yes, that's correct. So, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the final answer is 2865.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial setup. So, the function is y = sin(1/x), and we're looking for x-intercepts where y=0, which occurs when sin(1/x)=0. So, 1/x must be an integer multiple of \u03c0, so 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). Now, x must lie in (0.0001, 0.001). So, substituting x = 1/(n\u03c0), we have 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n:\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001: n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098862.\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001: n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098862.\n\nSince n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about whether each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0) is a one-to-one function for positive integers n, each n gives a unique x in the interval. So, yes, each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept in that interval.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if there's any overlap or if some x's might be outside the interval, but given that n is chosen such that x is strictly between 0.0001 and 0.001, I think it's safe.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: The function sin(1/x) oscillates increasingly rapidly as x approaches zero. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is very close to zero, the function oscillates a huge number of times, crossing the x-axis each time 1/x increases by \u03c0. So, the number of zeros is roughly proportional to the change in 1/x divided by \u03c0.\n\nLet me compute the change in 1/x from x=0.001 to x=0.0001.\n\nAt x=0.001, 1/x = 1000.\n\nAt x=0.0001, 1/x = 10000.\n\nSo, the interval of 1/x is from 1000 to 10000.\n\nThe number of zeros of sin(\u03b8) between \u03b8=1000 and \u03b8=10000 is approximately the number of times \u03b8 crosses a multiple of \u03c0 in that interval.\n\nEach zero occurs at \u03b8 = n\u03c0, so the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nWhich is the same as n between 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098862 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098862.\n\nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nSo, that confirms the earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0.

So, that's just barely above 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, let's check n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477796 19\u03c0 \u2248 59.69026042 So, total \u2248 942.477796 + 59.69026042 \u2248 1002.168056 So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.168056 \u2248 0.00099784, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval. Therefore, both n=319 and n=3183 give x values within the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Thus, the count is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Wait, but let me think again: is there any possibility that n=3183 gives x=0.0001 exactly? From the calculation, it's approximately 0.0001000031, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval. Similarly, n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0 something), which would be just below 0.0001, so it's not included. So, n goes up to 3183. Similarly, n=318 gives x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.0) \u2248 0.001, but since the interval is open, x=0.001 is excluded, so n=318 is excluded. Therefore, n starts at 319, which gives x\u22480.00099784, which is less than 0.001, so included. Therefore, the count is correct at 2865. Wait, but let me just confirm that 3183 - 319 is indeed 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Yes, that's correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Therefore, the final answer is 2865. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the initial steps. Let me re-express the inequalities: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, taking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities because reciprocals reverse the order for positive numbers): 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. That is, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098861 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098862. So, n must be integers strictly greater than 318.3098861 and strictly less than 3183.098862. So, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest integer n is 3183. Therefore, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, that's correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, let me think about the function sin(1/x). As x approaches 0 from the positive side, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates increasingly rapidly between -1 and 1. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is very close to zero, the function will oscillate a lot, crossing the x-axis many times. Each time 1/x crosses an integer multiple of \u03c0, the function crosses zero. So, the number of zeros should correspond to how many times 1/x passes through multiples of \u03c0 in that interval. So, for x between 0.0001 and 0.001, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000, which means it passes through all integer multiples of \u03c0 from \u03c0*319 up to \u03c0*3183, as we found earlier. Each time it crosses a multiple of \u03c0, it's a zero of the sine function. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which is the same as n between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.3098861 < n < 3183.098862, so n from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 2865 integers. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.6894, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.6894 \u2248 0.0001000031, which is indeed just above 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 1003.5, so 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009965, which is just below 0.001, so included as well. Therefore, the count from n=319 to n=3183 inclusive is correct, giving 2865 x-intercepts. Wait, but let me just check if n=3183 is indeed the last n where x > 0.0001. Let's see: For n=3184, x=1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10002.822) \u2248 0.00009997, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included in the interval. Therefore, n=3183 is the largest n such that x > 0.0001. Similarly, n=318: x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.36) \u2248 0.0009996, which is just below 0.001, so it's included. Wait, no, n=318: x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.36) \u2248 0.0009996, which is just below 0.001, so it's included. Wait, but earlier I thought n starts at 319. Wait, let me recast the inequalities. So, from 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001: n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183. From 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001: n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309, so the minimum integer n is 319. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, that's correct. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me think about it another way. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a very small interval near zero, the function oscillates rapidly. Each oscillation corresponds to a period of 2\u03c0 in terms of \u03b8 = 1/x. So, the number of oscillations (and thus the number of zeros) can be approximated by the change in \u03b8 over the interval. When x goes from 0.0001 to 0.001, \u03b8 = 1/x goes from 10000 to 1000. So, the change in \u03b8 is 10000 - 1000 = 9000. Each period of sin(\u03b8) is 2\u03c0, so the number of periods is 9000 / (2\u03c0) \u2248 9000 / 6.283 \u2248 1432. So, each period has two zeros (one at the start and one at the end), but since we're starting at \u03b8=1000 and ending at \u03b8=10000, the number of zeros would be approximately the number of periods times 2, but we have to adjust for the exact starting and ending points. But wait, that's a different approach and gives a different number. Wait, but I think the exact count is better done by considering that each zero occurs at \u03b8 = n\u03c0, so the number of zeros between \u03b8=1000 and \u03b8=10000 is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, which is the same as before. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Therefore, that method also gives 2865. So, both methods agree. Therefore, I'm confident that the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) has x-intercepts where \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\).

Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check if there's any possibility that some n's might give x outside the interval. For example, n=318: x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.0) \u2248 0.001, but since the interval is open, 0.001 is excluded. So, n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.001, which is the upper bound, but since the interval is open, it's excluded. Therefore, n must start at 319. Similarly, n=3184: x=1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10001.2) \u2248 0.000099988, which is less than 0.0001, so excluded. Therefore, n must end at 3183. So, our initial calculation of n from 319 to 3183 inclusive is correct, giving 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that 3183\u03c0 is indeed just over 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is just under 0.0001? Wait, earlier calculation showed 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.6894, so 1/9999.6894 \u2248 0.00010000312, which is just over 0.0001. So, it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n=3183 is included.\n\nTherefore, the total number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about the behavior of the function. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely as x approaches 0. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a small interval near zero, the function oscillates rapidly. Each oscillation corresponds to a zero crossing every \u03c0/(1/x) = x/\u03c0. Wait, perhaps another way to think about it is the number of zeros between two points. The number of zeros of sin(1/x) between a and b is roughly (1/(a\u03c0) - 1/(b\u03c0)), but let me see.\n\nWait, more accurately, the zeros occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0), so the number of zeros between a and b is the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is between a and b. Which is exactly what I did earlier. So, the number of integers n where a < 1/(n\u03c0) < b. Which is equivalent to 1/(b\u03c0) < n < 1/(a\u03c0). So, the number of integers n in that interval is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)).\n\nWait, let me check that. So, if a = 0.0001, then 1/(a\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, floor(1/(a\u03c0)) = 3183.\n\nSimilarly, b = 0.001, so 1/(b\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) = 319.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers n is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865, which matches our previous result.\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm it. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer n. To find how many such x lie in (0.0001, 0.001), we solve for n:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001  \n=> 318.309 < n < 3183.098\n\nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is:\n\n3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

So, both are included. But wait, how high can n go before x drops below 0.0001? Let me find the maximum n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, the maximum integer n is 3183.

So, why did I think n must be less than 3183.098? Because 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0001000017, which is still greater than 0.0001. Wait, but 3184 is greater than 3183.098, so n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0001000017, which is just barely above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. Therefore, perhaps n can go up to 3183, but also 3184 is still included because x is still above 0.0001. Wait, but 3183.098 is approximately 3183.1, so n=3183 is allowed, but n=3184 would be beyond that, right? Because 3184 > 3183.098, so n=3184 would make x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0001000017, which is still above 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, perhaps my initial upper bound for n was wrong. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inequality direction. Let's solve 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0 (positive, so inequality remains):\n\n1 > 0.0001 * n\u03c0\n\nThen, divide both sides by 0.0001\u03c0:\n\n1 / (0.0001\u03c0) > n\n\nWhich is n < 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098\n\nSo, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183.\n\nSimilarly, from 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0:\n\n1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by 0.001\u03c0:\n\nn > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.309, so the minimum integer n is 319.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that n=3184 would still give x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0001000017, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included.

This occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for some integer \\( n \\), which implies \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n\nWe need \\( x \\) to be within the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\). Therefore, we solve the inequalities:\n\\[ 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\]\n\nRewriting these inequalities:\n1. \\( 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\) implies \\( n < \\frac{1}{0.0001\\pi} \\approx 3183.098 \\)\n2. \\( \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\) implies \\( n > \\frac{1}{0.001\\pi} \\approx 318.309 \\)\n\nThus, \\( n \\) must be an integer in the range from 319 to 3183 inclusive.

    "text": "5, so total \u2248 565.48667 + 9.424775 \u2248 574.911445. So, total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796 + 574.911445 \u2248 9999.689405. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.689405 \u2248 0.0001000031, which is indeed just above 0.0001. So, x = 0.0001000031 is in (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, for n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 1003.5, so 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so included. Therefore, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive are valid. So, the count is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the subtraction. 3183 - 319: Let's compute 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, yes, 2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly as x approaches 0. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is very close to 0, the function oscillates infinitely many times, right? But in reality, since we're dealing with a finite interval, even though it's close to zero, the number of oscillations is finite. Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, it's 2865. But wait, that seems a lot, but perhaps it's correct.\n\nWait, let me think again. Each time n increases by 1, x decreases by 1/(n\u03c0) - 1/((n+1)\u03c0) = 1/(\u03c0(n)(n+1)). So, the spacing between consecutive x-intercepts is decreasing as x approaches zero, which makes sense because the function oscillates more rapidly.\n\nBut perhaps another way to think about this is to consider how many times the sine function completes a full cycle as x goes from 0.001 to 0.0001. The number of zeros would correspond to the number of half-cycles in that interval.\n\nAlternatively, we can think about the derivative to see how the function behaves, but maybe that's complicating things.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the exact values of n. Let me compute n_min and n_max more accurately.\n\nWe have:\n\nn_min = smallest integer greater than 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184\n\nSo, n_min = 319.\n\nSimilarly,\n\nn_max = largest integer less than 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, n_max = 3183.\n\nSo, the integers n run from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nNumber of integers = 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

So, that's approximately 0.0001000031, which is indeed greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100000 something, which is still greater than 0.0001, but wait, no, n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001000031, which is just over 0.0001, so n=3183 is included. Wait, but what about n=3184? Let's compute 3184\u03c0: 3184 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2248 9999.68941 + 3.1415926535 \u2248 10002.83000 So, 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/10002.83000 \u2248 0.0000999715, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. Therefore, n=3184 gives x\u22480.0000999715, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included in the interval. Therefore, the maximum n is 3183. Similarly, for the lower end, n=319 gives x\u22480.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. What about n=318? Let's check n=318: x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.796) \u2248 0.0009992, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Wait, but earlier, our inequality said n must be greater than 318.309, so n starts at 319. So, n=318 would give x\u22480.0009992, which is less than 0.001, but wait, our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0009992 is less than 0.001, but greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Wait, but according to our earlier calculation, n must be greater than 318.309, so n starts at 319. But wait, n=318 gives x\u22480.0009992, which is less than 0.001, but greater than 0.0001, so it's within the interval. So, does that mean our earlier calculation was off? Let me check. From 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, solving for n: n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=319 is the smallest integer. But wait, n=318 gives x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.0009992, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Wait, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=319 is the first integer. So, n=318 is less than 318.309, so n=318 is not included. But wait, when n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.0009992, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the inequality. Let me re-examine the inequality:\n\nWe have 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which implies n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309.\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=319 is the smallest integer n that satisfies this. Therefore, n=318 does not satisfy n > 318.309, so n=318 is excluded. But wait, n=318 gives x\u22480.0009992, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, there's a discrepancy here. Let me think: if n=318, then x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.0009992, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. But according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is less than that, so it shouldn't be included. Hmm, that suggests a mistake in my earlier reasoning.\n\nWait, let's go back. The inequality is 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, solving for n: n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309.\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=319 is the smallest integer. Therefore, n=318 is not included because 318 < 318.309. But when n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.0009992, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, why is there a discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inequality direction. Let me re-express it:\n\nWe have 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nMultiplying both sides by n\u03c0 (positive, so inequality remains):\n\n1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0.\n\nDividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0:\n\nn > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309.\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=319 is the first integer. Therefore, n=318 is not included because 318 < 318.309, so 1/(318\u03c0) \u22480.0009992 is less than 0.001, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is excluded. But wait, that seems contradictory because x=0.0009992 is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, perhaps the inequality is correct, but n=318 gives x=0.0009992, which is less than 0.001, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is excluded. So, perhaps my initial approach was wrong.\n\nWait, let me think differently. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001). So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001.\n\nSo, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nSo, let's solve for n in both inequalities.\n\nFirst inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001.\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 > 0.0001 * n\u03c0.\n\nDivide both sides by 0.0001\u03c0: n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098.\n\nSecond inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0.\n\nDivide both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309.\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, n=319 is the first integer, and n=3183 is the last integer.\n\nThus, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nBut wait, earlier, I thought that n=318 gives x\u22480.0009992, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is excluded. So, that suggests that n=318 is not included, which is correct because n must be greater than 318.309, so n=319 is the first integer.\n\nWait, but let me check n=318.309: if n=318.309, then x=1/(318.309\u03c0)=0.001 exactly. So, since our interval is open, x=0.001 is excluded, so n must be greater than 318.309 to have x < 0.001. Therefore, n=319 is the first integer where x < 0.001.\n\nSimilarly, n=3183.098 gives x=0.0001 exactly, which is excluded, so n must be less than 3183.098, so n=3183 is the last integer where x > 0.0001.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 2865 integers.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n=318 gives x\u22480.0009992, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. But according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is excluded. So, that seems contradictory because x=0.0009992 is within the interval, but n=318 is excluded. So, perhaps my initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, let's think differently: perhaps the function sin(1/x) has an x-intercept whenever 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0, i.e., 1/x = n\u03c0, so x=1/(n\u03c0). So, for each integer n, we have an x-intercept at x=1/(n\u03c0). Now, we need to count how many such x's lie in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nSo, x must satisfy 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nSo, let's solve for n:\n\nFrom 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0):\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0: 0.0001 * n\u03c0 < 1\n\nDivide both sides by 0.0001\u03c0: n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001:\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309\n\nSo, n must satisfy 318.309 < n < 3183.098\n\nSince n must be an integer, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nSo, the answer is 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n=318 gives x\u22480.0009992, which is within the interval, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is excluded. Therefore, n=319 is the first n that gives x within the interval.\n\nWait, but let me check n=318.309: x=1/(318.309\u03c0)=0.001 exactly, which is excluded because the interval is open. So, n must be greater than 318.309 to have x < 0.001.\n\nTherefore, n=319 is the first integer where x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nSimilarly, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001000031, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nThus, the total number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm with n=318: x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.0009992, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. But according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is less than that, so it's excluded. So, that suggests that n=318 is not included, but x=0.0009992 is within the interval. So, perhaps my initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I should not use the inequality but instead find the range of n where x=1/(n\u03c0) lies strictly between 0.0001 and 0.001.\n\nSo, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nWhich implies:\n\n1/(0.001) < n\u03c0 < 1/(0.0001)\n\nSo, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDivide all parts by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nCompute 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309\n\nCompute 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098\n\nSo, n must satisfy 318.309 < n < 3183.098\n\nSince n is an integer, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nThus, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). To find x in (0.0001, 0.001), solve 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. This gives n between approximately 318.309 and 3183.098. The integers n range from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 2865 x-intercepts. Wait, but let me just make sure that there are no other intercepts outside this n range that might still lie within the interval. For example, if n were 318, then x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.53) \u2248 0.00099947, which is just below 0.001, but wait, 0.00099947 is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval.

From 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, we had n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. Wait, but n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.00099947, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. But according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=319 is the first integer. Wait, but if n=318 gives x\u22480.00099947, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval. So, why did I exclude n=318? Because when I solved 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, I got n > 318.309, so n must be greater than that, so n=319 is the first integer. But wait, n=318 is less than 318.309, so 1/(318\u03c0) is greater than 0.001? Wait, no, 1/(318\u03c0) \u22480.00099947, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, perhaps my initial calculation was wrong. Let me recast the inequality correctly.\n\nSo, the original inequalities are:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nThen, dividing all parts by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nCalculating:\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098861\n\n10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098862\n\nSo, n must satisfy:\n\n318.3098861 < n < 3183.098862\n\nSince n must be an integer, n can be from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. So, n=319 is the first integer, and n=3183 is the last. So, n=318 is less than 318.3098861, so 1/(318\u03c0) \u22480.00099947, which is greater than 0.001? Wait, no, 0.00099947 is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Wait, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.3098861, so n=319 is the first integer. So, n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.00099947, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval. But according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.3098861, so n=319 is the first integer where x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009965, which is less than 0.001. Wait, but if n=318 gives x\u22480.00099947, which is still less than 0.001, so why isn't n=318 included? Because 318 is less than 318.3098861, so n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.00099947, which is greater than 0.001? Wait, no, 0.00099947 is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Wait, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.3098861, so n=319 is the first integer. So, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the inequality.\n\nWait, let's re-express the inequalities correctly.\n\nWe have:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nSo, dividing by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nWhich is:\n\n318.3098861 < n < 3183.098862\n\nTherefore, n must be greater than 318.3098861 and less than 3183.098862.\n\nSo, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest is 3183.\n\nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that n=318 gives x\u22480.00099947, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. But according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.3098861, so n=318 is less than that, so it's excluded. So, even though x=1/(318\u03c0) is less than 0.001, because n=318 is less than 318.3098861, it's not included. So, the first n is 319, giving x\u22480.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nSimilarly, n=3183 gives x\u22480.000100003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nSo, the count is from n=319 to n=3183, which is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm with another approach. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. The number of oscillations increases as x approaches 0. The interval we're looking at is (0.0001, 0.001). So, the function will cross the x-axis every time 1/x increases by \u03c0. So, the number of zeros is roughly the change in (1/x) divided by \u03c0. Let's compute the change in (1/x) over the interval.\n\nAt x=0.001, 1/x=1000.\n\nAt x=0.0001, 1/x=10000.\n\nSo, the change in 1/x is 10000 - 1000 = 9000.\n\nTherefore, the number of zeros is approximately 9000 / \u03c0 \u2248 2866.198.\n\nBut since we're dealing with an open interval, we don't include the endpoints, so we might subtract 1, giving approximately 2865, which matches our earlier count.\n\nSo, that seems to confirm that the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but in the approximation, I got 2866.198, but since we can't have a fraction of an intercept, we take the integer part, which would be 2866. But our exact calculation gave 2865. Hmm, there's a discrepancy here. Let me see where I might have gone wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the exact count is 2865, and the approximation is 2866.198, which is very close but slightly higher. The reason for the difference is that the exact count considers the exact bounds, whereas the approximation is a continuous measure. So, perhaps the exact count is 2865, as we calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial exact calculation. Let me check the exact count again.\n\nWe have n starting at 319 and ending at 3183.\n\nNumber of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nBut when I compute (1/x) from 1000 to 10000, the number of intervals of \u03c0 is (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 \u2248 9000 / \u03c0 \u2248 2866.198. So, that suggests that there are 2866 intervals, each corresponding to a zero crossing. But our exact count is 2865. Hmm, perhaps the exact count is one less than the approximation because the interval is open, so we don't count the endpoint. So, perhaps the exact count is 2865, while the approximation is 2866.198, which rounds to 2866. So, perhaps the exact count is 2865, and the approximation is 2866, which is very close.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the exact calculation. Let me check again.\n\nn must satisfy 318.3098861 < n < 3183.098862.\n\nSo, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183.\n\nNumber of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nCompute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864.\n\nThen add 1: 2864 + 1 = 2865.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nBut in the approximation, the number of zeros is (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 \u2248 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.198, which suggests 2866 zeros. So, why the discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps because when we take the floor of 3183.098862, we get 3183, and the ceiling of 318.3098861 is 319, so the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nBut the approximation is (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.198, which suggests 2866 zeros. So, perhaps the exact count is 2865, and the approximation is 2866.198, which is very close but slightly higher.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the exact count is 2866, and I made a mistake in the exact calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approximation is slightly off because it's a continuous measure, while the exact count is discrete.\n\nIn any case, the exact calculation gives 2865, so I think that's the correct answer.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. The function y = sin(1/x) has zeros where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0).\n\n2. We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\n3. Solving for n, we get 318.3098861 < n < 3183.098862.\n\n4. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\n5. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe number of x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is found by determining the integer values of n for which x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies within the interval. Solving the inequalities, we find n ranges from 319 to 3183, resulting in 2865 intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

So, 0.0001000031 > 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 is valid. Similarly, n=319 gives x \u2248 0.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Therefore, the count from n=319 to n=3183 inclusive is correct, giving 2865 x-intercepts. Wait, but let me check if there's a possibility that some n's might result in x being outside the interval. For example, if n were 318, then x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.35) \u2248 0.00099965, which is just below 0.001. But wait, 0.00099965 is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval. Wait, but earlier I thought n starts at 319, but wait, when n=318, x\u22480.00099965, which is less than 0.001, so it's within (0.0001, 0.001). So, why did I set n > 318.309? Let me go back. I had the inequality 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which gives n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. But wait, when n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.00099965, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Wait, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is less than 318.309, which would make x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.00099965, which is greater than 0.001? Wait, no, 0.00099965 is less than 0.001, so it's included. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inequality direction. Let me re-express the inequalities. We have x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let's solve for n. Starting with 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001: Multiply both sides by n\u03c0 (positive, so inequality remains): 1 > 0.0001 * n\u03c0 => 1 > n\u03c0 * 0.0001 => n\u03c0 < 10000 => n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001: Multiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 => 1 < n\u03c0/1000 => n\u03c0 > 1000 => n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must satisfy 318.30988618 < n < 3183.0988618. Since n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. So, n=319, 320, ..., 3183. Thus, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, 2865 x-intercepts. Wait, but earlier I thought that n=318 gives x\u22480.00099965, which is within the interval, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than approximately 318.309, so n=319 is the first integer. So, n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.00099965, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. But according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is less than that, which would mean x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.00099965, which is greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001, so it's included. Wait, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is less than that, so n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.00099965, which is within the interval. So, why did we set n starting at 319? That seems incorrect because n=318 gives a valid x within the interval. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inequality direction. Let me check again. We have 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. But wait, n=318 gives x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.00099965, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, why is n=318 excluded? Because n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is less than that, so it's excluded. But wait, when n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.00099965, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, is there a mistake in the inequality? Let me re-express: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309. Therefore, n=319 is the first integer, and n=318 is less than 318.309, so n=318 is excluded. But wait, when n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.00099965, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, why is n=318 excluded? Because according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is less than that, so it's excluded. But that seems contradictory because n=318 gives a valid x within the interval. So, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the inequality. Let me re-express the inequalities correctly. We have x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me solve for n in both inequalities. First inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001 = 10000 => n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. Second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n\u03c0 > 1/0.001 = 1000 => n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must satisfy 318.30988618 < n < 3183.0988618. Therefore, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183. So, n=319, 320, ..., 3183. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, n=318 is excluded because it's less than 318.30988618, but when n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.00099965, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Wait, this seems contradictory. Let me check the calculation again. If n=318, then x=1/(318\u03c0). Let's compute 318\u03c0: 318 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 318 * 3 = 954, 318 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 318 * 0.1 = 31.8, 318 * 0.0415926535 \u2248 let's compute 318 * 0.04 = 12.72, 318 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 0.506. So, total \u2248 31.8 + 12.72 = 44.52 + 0.506 \u2248 45.026. So, total 318\u03c0 \u2248 954 + 45.026 \u2248 999.026. So, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/999.026 \u2248 0.001000975. Wait, that's approximately 0.001000975, which is just over 0.001. So, x \u2248 0.001000975, which is greater than 0.001, so it's outside the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=318 gives x\u22480.001000975, which is just above 0.001, so it's excluded. That makes sense now. So, when n=318, x\u22480.001000975 > 0.001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the smallest n that gives x < 0.001 is n=319, because n=319 gives x\u22480.0009965 < 0.001. So, that's correct. Therefore, n starts at 319. Similarly, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001000031 > 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, the count from n=319 to n=3183 inclusive is correct, giving 2865 x-intercepts. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integers n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need to find n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving these inequalities gives n between approximately 318.309 and 3183.098. The integers n range from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

As x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001, 1/x increases from 1000 to 10000. So, sin(1/x) will oscillate between -1 and 1 as 1/x goes from 1000 to 10000. The number of zero crossings is equal to the number of times 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0 in that interval. So, starting at 1/x = 1000, which is between 318\u03c0 \u2248 1000.530 and 317\u03c0 \u2248 997.233. Wait, no, let me compute 318\u03c0: 318 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 1000.530. So, 1/x starts at 1000 when x=0.001, which is just below 318\u03c0. Then, as x decreases to 0.0001, 1/x increases to 10000. The number of times 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000 is the number of integers n such that n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000. Wait, but that's a different way to look at it. Let me see: n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000. So, n must be between 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, same as before. Therefore, the number of zero crossings is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, that confirms it again.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 319\u03c0 and 3183\u03c0 to see where they lie. 319\u03c0 \u2248 1002.168, which is greater than 1000, so when x=0.001, 1/x=1000, which is just below 319\u03c0. So, the first zero crossing after x=0.001 is at x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009978, which is within our interval. Similarly, the last zero crossing before x=0.0001 is at x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000031, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. So, all zero crossings from n=319 to n=3183 are included. Therefore, the count is 2865.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning, so the answer should be 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Solving for x gives x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. This leads to 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, or 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. Thus, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

So, that's approximately 0.0001000031, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10002.62) \u2248 0.000099974, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded.

So total \u2248954 + 31.8=985.8 +12.72=998.52 +0.505\u2248999.025. So, 1/(318\u03c0)\u22481/999.025\u22480.001000975, which is greater than 0.001, so it's outside the upper bound of the interval. Therefore, n=318 gives x\u22480.001000975, which is greater than 0.001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the smallest n that gives x < 0.001 is n=319, as previously determined. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.

Similarly, n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477796, 19\u03c0 \u2248 59.6902604, so total \u2248 942.477796 + 59.6902604 \u2248 1002.168056. So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.168056 \u2248 0.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 2865 x-intercepts. So, I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me think if there's any possibility I missed something. For example, could there be any x in that interval where sin(1/x) = 0 without 1/x being an integer multiple of \u03c0? I don't think so because sin(\u03b8) = 0 only when \u03b8 is an integer multiple of \u03c0. So, every x-intercept must satisfy 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). Therefore, all x-intercepts in that interval are accounted for by n from 319 to 3183. So, the number is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0, i.e., x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. Within the interval (0.0001, 0.001), n ranges from 319 to 3183, yielding 2865 intercepts.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."
