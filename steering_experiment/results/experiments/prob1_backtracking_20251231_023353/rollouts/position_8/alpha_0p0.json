    "text": " Let me write that down: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. I can solve this inequality for n to find the range of integers that satisfy it. Let me start by taking reciprocals, remembering that reversing the inequalities when taking reciprocals because all terms are positive. So, taking reciprocals, we get: 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those values: 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10,000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10,000. Now, to solve for n, I'll divide each part by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10,000/\u03c0. Let me compute those values numerically. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10,000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10,000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. Now, since n must be an integer, n ranges from the next integer greater than 318.309886184, which is 319, up to the integer less than 3183.09886184, which is 3183. So, n can take integer values from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find how many integers are in this range, I subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add one (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Wait, that seems like a lot of intercepts, but considering the interval is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a very small range near zero, and as x approaches zero, 1/x becomes very large, so sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. But in this specific interval, it's a finite number. Hmm, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 1000 / \u03c0 is approximately 318.31, so n starts at 319. 10,000 / \u03c0 is approximately 3183.098, so n ends at 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. Within the interval (0.0001, 0.001), n ranges from 319 to 3183, resulting in 2865 intercepts.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

    "text": " Let me write that down: 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Substituting x = 1/(n\u03c0) into this inequality, I get 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me solve for n. First, I'll take the reciprocals of all parts, remembering that flipping the inequalities because reciprocating reverses the order for positive numbers. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those reciprocals: 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Now, dividing all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n must be greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184. So, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then adjust. Wait, actually, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the graph of y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in that interval.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) crosses the x-axis whenever 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0, i.e., at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. For x in (0.0001, 0.001), n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of such integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

    "text": " Let me write that as inequalities: 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), I can substitute that into the inequalities to find the range of n. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me solve for n in both parts of this inequality. Starting with the left part: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that this will reverse the inequality, I get 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Calculating 1/0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, which is approximately 3.1416, so n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: 10000 divided by 3.1416 is approximately 3183.098862. Since n must be an integer, n can be up to 3183. Now, the right part of the inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, 1/0.001 > n\u03c0. 1/0.001 is 1000, so 1000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, n < 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 divided by 3.1416 is approximately 318.3098862. So n must be less than approximately 318.3098862, meaning the maximum integer n is 318. Wait, but earlier I had n < approximately 3183.098862, so n must be less than 3183. But now, from the upper bound, n must be less than 318.3098862. That seems contradictory because 318 is less than 3183. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check my steps again. So, x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, so 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), substituting gives 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me invert each part correctly. Starting with the left inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Taking reciprocals (and flipping the inequality): 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0, which is 10000 > n\u03c0, so n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098862. For the right inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and flipping the inequality again): 1/0.001 > n\u03c0, which is 1000 > n\u03c0, so n < 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098862. Wait, so that means n must satisfy both n < 3183.098862 and n < 318.3098862. But 318.3098862 is less than 3183.098862, so the stricter condition is n < 318.3098862. So, n can be any integer less than 318.3098862, meaning n can be up to 318. But wait, that doesn't make sense because if n is up to 318, then 1/(n\u03c0) would be as large as 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.001, which is the upper bound of x. Similarly, when n is 319, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so that's still within the interval. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the inequalities. Let me think again. The x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) must be in (0.0001, 0.001). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me solve for n in each inequality.\n\nFirst, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001 \u21d2 n\u03c0 < 10000 \u21d2 n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098862.\n\nSecond, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u21d2 n\u03c0 > 1/0.001 \u21d2 n\u03c0 > 1000 \u21d2 n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098862.\n\nSo, n must be greater than approximately 318.3098862 and less than approximately 3183.098862.\n\nSince n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183.\n\nNow, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 is 2865.\n\nWait, that seems a lot. Let me check with n=319: 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(319*3.1416) \u2248 1/1003 \u2248 0.000997, which is just under 0.001, so that's included.\n\nn=318: 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.2) \u2248 0.0009998, which is just under 0.001, so n=318 is also included. Wait, but earlier I thought n had to be greater than 318.3098862, so n starts at 319. But wait, when n=318, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009998, which is less than 0.001, so that's within the interval. So maybe my initial calculation was wrong.\n\nWait, let me correct that. The inequality 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u21d2 n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098862. So n must be greater than 318.3098862, so the smallest integer n is 319.\n\nSimilarly, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098862, so the largest integer n is 3183.\n\nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nThe number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me verify with n=319: 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.1) \u2248 0.000997, which is within (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=3183: 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, which is the lower bound. But since the interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), does x=0.0001 count? No, because it's open. So, 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098862, so n can be up to 3183 because 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so n must be less than 3183.098862, meaning n can be up to 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is not included. So, n must be less than 3183.098862, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is not included. So, actually, n must be less than 3183.098862, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, we need to check if 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001.\n\nWait, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, which is exactly the lower bound. So, since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), we need x > 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098862. So, n can be up to 3183, but when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is not included. Therefore, the maximum n is 3183 - 1 = 3182? Wait, no, because 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, so n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. So, n must be less than 3183.098862, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, n must be less than 3183.098862, so the maximum n is 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded, so the maximum n is 3182. Wait, let me compute 1/(3182\u03c0): 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000 - 3.1416 \u2248 9996.8584, so 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.8584 \u2248 0.00010003, which is just above 0.0001, so that's included. So, n can be up to 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010003 > 0.0001.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n goes up to 3183. Let me clarify:\n\nWe have 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098862.\n\nSo, n can be up to 3183, but when n=3183, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is not included because the interval is open. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010003 > 0.0001.\n\nSimilarly, for the lower bound, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098862, so the smallest integer n is 319.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nNow, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\nLet me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. Let me check the math:\n\n3182 - 319 = ?\n\n3182 - 300 = 2882\n\n2882 - 19 = 2863\n\nSo, 3182 - 319 = 2863\n\nThen, 2863 + 1 = 2864.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier when I considered n up to 3183, I got 2865, but now with n up to 3182, it's 2864.\n\nBut let me confirm with specific values.\n\nTake n=319: 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000997 < 0.001, so included.\n\nn=3182: 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010003 > 0.0001, so included.\n\nn=3183: 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded.\n\nSo, n runs from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nNumber of terms: 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to see if my formula is correct.\n\nSuppose I have numbers from 5 to 10 inclusive. The count is 10 - 5 + 1 = 6, which is correct: 5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nSimilarly, from 319 to 3182 inclusive: 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought it was 2865, but now I'm getting 2864. Let me make sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering whether n=3183 is included or not.\n\nWait, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), x must be greater than 0.0001, so n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, n can only go up to 3182.\n\nThus, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach.\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. The number of oscillations increases as x approaches 0. In the interval (a, b), the number of zeros can be approximated by the number of times 1/x crosses multiples of \u03c0. So, the number of zeros is roughly the number of n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (a, b).\n\nSo, in this case, a=0.0001, b=0.001.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098862.\n\nAnd 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u21d2 n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098862.\n\nSo, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. So, perhaps n=3183 is excluded, making the upper limit 3182.\n\nWait, but let's compute 1/(3183\u03c0):\n\n3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 Let's compute 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.14159265 \u2248 3183 * 0.1416 \u2248 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, 3183 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0928. So total \u2248 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.0928 \u2248 450.7128. So total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9549 + 450.7128 \u2248 9999.7128. Therefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.7128 \u2248 0.0001000028, which is just over 0.0001. Wait, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000028, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001000028, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, n can go up to 3183.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier calculation. Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0 more accurately.\n\n\u03c0 \u2248 3.141592653589793.\n\n3183 * \u03c0 = 3183 * 3.141592653589793.\n\nLet me compute 3000 * \u03c0 = 9424.77796077.\n\n183 * \u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 180 * \u03c0 \u2248 565.486677646, and 3 * \u03c0 \u2248 9.4247779608. So total \u2248 565.486677646 + 9.4247779608 \u2248 574.911455607.\n\nSo, total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796077 + 574.911455607 \u2248 9999.68941638.\n\nTherefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.68941638 \u2248 0.0001000031, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 is included.\n\nSimilarly, n=3184: 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3184*3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10002.45) \u2248 0.0000999755, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded.\n\nSo, n can go up to 3183, as 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000031 > 0.0001.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nNumber of integers: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865.\n\nWait, so now I get 2865. Earlier, I thought n=3183 was excluded, but actually, 1/(3183\u03c0) is just over 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, n=3183 is included, making the count 2865.\n\nWait, let me confirm with n=3183: 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000031, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, n goes from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nCompute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2865.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2864 because I thought n=3183 was excluded, but now I see that n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001000031, which is included, so n=3183 is valid.\n\nTherefore, the correct number is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check with n=3183: 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000031, which is indeed greater than 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nSimilarly, n=3184: 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999755, which is less than 0.0001, so excluded.\n\nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 2865 integers.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, leading to x = 1/(n\u03c0).

    "text": " Let me write that as 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), I can substitute that into the inequalities to find the range of n. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me solve for n in both parts of the inequality. First, the left part: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Let's take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that flipping the inequality when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive. So, 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. 1/0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Then, dividing both sides by \u03c0, I get n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that. \u03c0 is approximately 3.14159265, so 10000 divided by that is approximately 10000 / 3.14159265 \u2248 3183.098. So, n < approximately 3183.098. Since n is an integer, the maximum n can be is 3183. Now, the right part of the inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, take reciprocals, so n\u03c0 > 1/0.001. 1/0.001 is 1000. So, n\u03c0 > 1000. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.14159265 \u2248 318.309. Since n is an integer, the smallest n can be is 319. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. Now, I need to count how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers between a and b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Each of these n corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, starting from the inequalities: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n gives 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which leads to 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating those: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n must be greater than that, so n starts at 319. 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n must be less than that, so n ends at 3183. Then, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Yep, that seems correct.

    "text": " So, I can write the inequalities: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. I need to solve for n here. Let me rewrite these inequalities. Starting with 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that flipping the inequality when taking reciprocals (since both sides are positive), I get 10000 > n\u03c0. Similarly, for the upper bound: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which when taking reciprocals gives n\u03c0 > 1000. So, combining both inequalities, I have 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values. First, \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n ranges from the next integer greater than 318.309886184, which is 319, up to the integer less than 3183.09886184, which is 3183. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the numbers: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. First, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31, so n starts at 319. 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n ends at 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more, so 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then add 1, which gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n in that range, which means 2865 x-intercepts. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me think again. Each n gives a unique x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0), right? So, as n increases from 319 to 3183, x decreases from 1/(319\u03c0) to 1/(3183\u03c0). Let me check if these x-values are indeed within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.77) \u2248 0.000997, which is just below 0.001. Wait, 0.000997 is less than 0.001, so that's okay. Now, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, but wait, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001. So, is 1/(3183\u03c0) greater than 0.0001? Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10000 \u2248 0.0001. But since \u03c0 is approximately 3.14159265, 3183\u03c0 is approximately 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but slightly less because 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001. Wait, that would mean x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. Therefore, n cannot be 3183 because x would be less than 0.0001. Hmm, so maybe my upper bound is off by one. Let me check again. So, we have 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which implies n\u03c0 < 10000, so n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be less than 3183.09886184, meaning the maximum integer n is 3183. But wait, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is equal to the lower bound, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but let me compute it more accurately. Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0: 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute 3000 * \u03c0 = 9424.77796077, and 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 574.7896814. So, adding together, 9424.77796077 + 574.7896814 \u2248 9999.56764217. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.56764217, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.56764217 \u2248 0.0001000043. Wait, that's actually greater than 0.0001. Hmm, because 1/9999.5676 is approximately 0.0001000043, which is just a bit more than 0.0001. So, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000043, which is just barely above 0.0001, so it's inside the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 is acceptable. Similarly, n=319: 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.77) \u2248 0.00099728, which is just below 0.001, so it's inside the interval. So, both n=319 and n=3183 give x-values within the interval. Therefore, the number of integer n's is from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but let me make sure that 3183\u03c0 is indeed just over 10000, so that 1/(3183\u03c0) is just over 0.0001. Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0 more accurately. 3183 * \u03c0: Let's compute 3000\u03c0 = 9424.77796, 180\u03c0=565.486677, 3\u03c0=9.42477796. So, 3183 = 3000 + 180 + 3. So, 3000\u03c0 + 180\u03c0 + 3\u03c0 = 9424.77796 + 565.486677 + 9.42477796 \u2248 9424.77796 + 565.486677 = 9990.264637 + 9.42477796 \u2248 9999.689415. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.689415, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.689415 \u2248 0.000100003, which is indeed just over 0.0001. So, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100003 is in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 is acceptable. Similarly, n=319: 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.77) \u2248 0.00099728, which is less than 0.001, so that's good. So, the number of n's is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Let me just confirm that subtraction: 3183 - 319. 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864, then add 1: 2865. So, yes, 2865 x-intercepts. Wait, but I should also make sure that for each n from 319 to 3183, 1/(n\u03c0) is indeed in (0.0001, 0.001). Let me check for n=319: 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000997 < 0.001, so that's good. For n=3183: 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100003 > 0.0001, so that's good. What about n=3184? 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10002.54) \u2248 0.000099975, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. So, n=3183 is the last n that gives x inside the interval. Similarly, n=318 is 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.66) \u2248 0.00099934, which is less than 0.001, so that's inside. Wait, but n=318: 318\u03c0 \u2248 1000.66, so 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099934, which is less than 0.001, so it's inside. But earlier, I thought n starts at 319. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the lower bound. Let me check again. The inequality is 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which implies n\u03c0 < 10000, so n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n can be up to 3183. Similarly, for the lower inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n\u03c0 > 1000, so n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184, so the smallest integer n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but earlier I thought about n=318: 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099934, which is less than 0.001, so that's inside the interval. But according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309886184, so n=319 is the first integer. So, n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099934, which is inside (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309886184, so n=319 is the first integer. So, n=318 would be less than that, so n=318 is not included. Wait, but 318 is less than 318.309886184, so n=318 is not allowed. So, n starts at 319. So, n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's inside. Therefore, the count is from 319 to 3183, which is 2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0). To find the number of such x in (0.0001, 0.001), we solve 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. This gives 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183, resulting in 2865 integer values of n.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

I can solve for n here. Let's start with the left inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Taking reciprocals on both sides (and remembering to flip the inequality sign because reciprocals reverse the inequality for positive numbers), we get n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating 1/0.0001: 1 divided by 0.0001 is 10000. So, n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n is an integer, n \u2264 3183. Now, let's look at the right inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001. 1/0.001 is 1000, so n\u03c0 > 1000. Therefore, n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618. Since n is an integer, n \u2265 319. Now, putting it all together, n must satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. So, n can take integer values from 319 up to 3183. To find how many integers are in this range, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add one (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 integer values of n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait a second, let me double-check that subtraction: 3183 minus 319. Let's do it step by step. 3183 - 300 is 2883, and then subtract 19 more, which gives 2864. Yes, that's correct. So, adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, but wait, does n start at 319 and go up to 3183 inclusive? Yes, because 319 is the smallest integer greater than 318.309..., and 3183 is the largest integer less than 3183.098..., so both are included. Therefore, the total number of x-intercepts is 2865. Let me just think if there's any possibility I've missed something. For example, could there be any overlap or something where x = 1/(n\u03c0) could be outside the interval? Well, since n starts at 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) is just less than 0.001, and x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is just greater than 0.0001. So, all these x values are indeed within the interval.

We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so solving 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 gives n between approximately 319 and 3183. Thus, there are 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 intercepts.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

    "text": " Let me write that down as inequalities: 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Substituting x = 1/(n\u03c0), this becomes 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. I can solve this inequality for n to find the range of integers n that satisfy it. Let me rearrange each part of the inequality. Starting with the left part: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that reversing the inequality when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive, I get 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Calculating 1/0.0001, that's 10000. So, 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, which is approximately 3.14159, I get n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.14159 \u2248 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n can be is 3183.\n\nNow, moving to the right part of the inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, which reverses the inequality, I get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 / 3.14159 \u2248 318.309. Since n must be an integer, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n can be is 319.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the numbers: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then adding 1 gives 2865. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, 3183 - 319: Let me compute that step by step. 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then minus 19 more is 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865. So, that's correct. So, there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. So, between x = 0.0001 and x = 0.001, which is a very small interval near zero, the function will oscillate infinitely many times if we consider all real numbers, but here we're only considering up to x = 0.001. But since x is bounded below by 0.0001, the corresponding n values are from 319 to 3183, which are finite, so the number of intercepts should indeed be 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check if n = 319 gives x = 1/(319\u03c0). Let me compute that: 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.14159 \u2248 1003. So, 1/1003 \u2248 0.000997, which is approximately 0.001, but just a bit less. Wait, 0.001 is 1/1000, so 1/(319\u03c0) is approximately 1/1003 \u2248 0.000997, which is indeed less than 0.001. Similarly, n = 3183: 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159 \u2248 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is just above 0.0001. So, both ends are included correctly.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.

Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183, inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, 3183 - 318 = 2865, and adding 1 gives 2866. Wait, let me check that again. If n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183, the number of terms is 3183 - 318 = 2865, but I think I made a mistake here. Wait, actually, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, no, that can't be right because 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, but let me double-check with smaller numbers to make sure. For example, from 1 to 3, the number of integers is 3 - 1 + 1 = 3, which is correct. So, applying that here, it's 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but earlier I thought 3183 - 318 = 2865, but that's incorrect because I should subtract 319, not 318. So, the correct count is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the inequalities. Let me go back. The x-intercepts are at x = 1/(n\u03c0), so when x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, 1/(n\u03c0) must be between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals, as I did before, gives 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which leads to n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, yes, 2865 x-intercepts.

Let's start by taking reciprocals on all sides, remembering that reversing the inequalities because taking reciprocals flips the inequality signs. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those, 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Now, divide all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute those values. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, n ranges from the smallest integer greater than 318.309886184 to the largest integer less than 3183.09886184. So, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest integer n is 3183. Now, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183, but wait, let me check: 3183 - 319 + 1. Because when counting inclusive, the number of terms is (last - first) + 1. So, 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial inequality. Let me go back through the steps. So, starting again: x is in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), then 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals, remembering to flip the inequalities: 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183, inclusive. Now, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319. 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me think again: each n corresponds to a unique x in the interval, right? Because x = 1/(n\u03c0), and as n increases, x decreases. So, each n gives a distinct x in the interval. So, yes, each integer n from 319 to 3183 gives a unique x-intercept in that interval. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me check if n=319 is included correctly. So, n starts at 319 because 318.309886184 is just above 318, so the next integer is 319. Similarly, n ends at 3183 because 3183.09886184 is just above 3183, so the integer part is 3183. So, yes, from 319 to 3183 inclusive, so 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's correct.

So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those, 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Now, I can divide all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n. Let me compute 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 1000/\u03c0 is about 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 is 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be an integer such that 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184.

So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nBut wait, let me think again: as x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. So, between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a very small interval near zero, there are many oscillations, hence many zeros. The calculation suggests 2865, which seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the number of zeros by considering how many times 1/x crosses multiples of \u03c0 as x goes from 0.0001 to 0.001.\n\nLet me consider x from 0.0001 to 0.001, so 1/x goes from 10000 down to 1000.\n\nSo, 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000 as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001.\n\nSo, sin(1/x) will cross zero every time 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0.\n\nSo, the number of zeros is equal to the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000.\n\nWait, but actually, when 1/x goes from 10000 to 1000, it's decreasing, so it will cross each multiple of \u03c0 once. So, the number of zeros is equal to the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000.\n\nWait, but I think that's similar to what I did before. Let me see:\n\nThe smallest multiple of \u03c0 greater than 1000 is the next integer multiple after 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so the first multiple is 319\u03c0.\n\nSimilarly, the largest multiple of \u03c0 less than 10000 is floor(10000/\u03c0) = 3183.09886184, so the last multiple is 3183\u03c0.\n\nSo, the number of multiples is from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865, as before.\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that each multiple of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000 is crossed exactly once as 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000. Since sin(1/x) is oscillating, each time 1/x passes a multiple of \u03c0, the function crosses zero. So, yes, each multiple of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000 corresponds to one zero crossing.\n\nTherefore, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183, which is 2865.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

    "text": " So, I can set up the inequality 0.0001 < x < 0.001, and substitute x with 1/(n\u03c0). That gives me 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Now, I need to solve this inequality for n. Let me write that down:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nI can take reciprocals on all parts, but I have to remember that taking reciprocals reverses the inequalities. So, let's see:\n\nFirst, let's handle the left part: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Taking reciprocals gives 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0, which is 10000 > n\u03c0. So, n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nSimilarly, the right part: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals gives n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is n\u03c0 > 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0.\n\nNow, let me compute these values numerically to find the range of n.\n\nFirst, 1000/\u03c0. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 1000 divided by \u03c0 is about 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184.\n\nSimilarly, 10000/\u03c0 is 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.09886184.\n\nBut n has to be an integer, right? So, n must be integers from the next integer greater than 318.309886184 up to the integer less than 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nTo find the number of integers between two numbers, inclusive, you can subtract the smaller number from the larger one and add 1. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me calculate that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183.\n\nTherefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. So, x is between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, when x is 0.0001, 1/x is 10000, and when x is 0.001, 1/x is 1000. So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000 as x moves from 0.001 to 0.0001. Wait, no, actually, when x increases, 1/x decreases. So, as x goes from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x goes from 10000 down to 1000. So, \u03b8 = 1/x moves from 10000 to 1000. So, sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 is n\u03c0, and n\u03c0 must lie between 1000 and 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000 \u2264 n\u03c0 \u2264 10000. Therefore, n must be between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which is the same as before, so n is between approximately 318.309886184 and 3183.09886184. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which gives 2865 intercepts.\n\nWait, but I should check if 319\u03c0 is greater than 1000 and 3183\u03c0 is less than 10000.\n\nCompute 319\u03c0: 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 319 * 3 = 957, 319 * 0.1416 \u2248 319 * 0.1 = 31.9, 319 * 0.0416 \u2248 13.2664, so total \u2248 957 + 31.9 + 13.2664 \u2248 957 + 45.1664 \u2248 1002.1664. So, 319\u03c0 \u2248 1002.1664, which is just above 1000, so that's good.\n\nSimilarly, 3183\u03c0: 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute that. 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, and 183\u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.1416 \u2248 183 * 3 = 549, 183 * 0.1416 \u2248 25.9608, so total \u2248 549 + 25.9608 \u2248 574.9608. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796 + 574.9608 \u2248 9999.73876. Which is just under 10000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.73876, which is less than 10000. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, n can be 319, 320, ..., up to 3183, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 is 2865. That seems correct.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider a smaller example. Suppose I have n from 2 to 5 inclusive. The numbers are 2,3,4,5. So, 5 - 2 = 3, plus 1 is 4 numbers. Correct. So, yes, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Each time 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0, the function sin(1/x) crosses zero. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), 1/x goes from 10000 down to 1000. So, every time 1/x passes through n\u03c0, where n is an integer, we get an x-intercept. So, the number of such n's is the number of times n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000. So, n must be from ceil(1000/\u03c0) to floor(10000/\u03c0). As we calculated earlier, ceil(1000/\u03c0) is 319, and floor(10000/\u03c0) is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but is there a possibility that 3183\u03c0 is exactly 10000? Let me check: 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.0415926535 \u2248 let's see, 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, 3183 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 approximately 5.07. So, adding up: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.07 \u2248 450.69. So, total 9549 + 450.69 \u2248 9999.69. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.69, which is less than 10000. So, 3183\u03c0 is less than 10000, so 3183 is included.\n\nSimilarly, 319\u03c0 \u2248 1002.1664, which is greater than 1000, so 319 is included.\n\nTherefore, the count is correct.\n\nWait, but another thought: since x is in (0.0001, 0.001), which is an open interval, does that affect whether x = 1/(n\u03c0) is included? Because x has to be strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) has to be strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n\u03c0 < 10000, and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u21d2 n\u03c0 > 1000. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so n must be integers such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 and less than 10000/\u03c0. So, as we calculated, n is from 319 to 3183, inclusive. So, the number of such n's is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

    "text": " Let me write that as inequalities: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. I can solve for n here. Let me flip the inequalities because I'm dealing with reciprocals, remembering that flipping inequalities reverses them. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those values: 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10,000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10,000. Now, I can divide through by \u03c0 to solve for n: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10,000/\u03c0. Let me compute these numbers approximately. Since \u03c0 is roughly 3.1415926535, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.3098861. Similarly, 10,000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10,000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.098862. Now, since n has to be an integer, n must be greater than 318.3098861 and less than 3183.098862. So, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183. Now, to find how many integers are between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183, but wait, let me think. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. 3183 minus 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more, so 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, that seems correct.

So, starting from 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, taking reciprocals gives 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10,000, which is correct because 1/0.001 is 1000 and 1/0.0001 is 10,000. Then, dividing by \u03c0, yes, that gives 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10,000/\u03c0, which is correct. So, the number of integers between 1000/\u03c0 and 10,000/\u03c0 is indeed 2865.

Now, I can solve for n in both parts of this inequality. Let's start with the left part: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that reversing the inequality when taking reciprocals, since both sides are positive. So, 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. 1/0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, I get n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886.

Again, taking reciprocals, which reverses the inequality: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001. 1/0.001 is 1000, so n\u03c0 > 1000. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, n > 1000/\u03c0.

Therefore, there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check that. If n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then +1 is 2865. Yeah, that seems right. So, each of these n values corresponds to an x-intercept in the given interval. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we determine when \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\).

Let me rearrange the inequalities. Starting with the left part: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, I have to remember that taking reciprocals reverses the inequality, so 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. 1/0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, I get n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n is an integer, n \u2264 3183.\n\nNow, looking at the right part of the inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Let me calculate that: 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618. Since n is an integer, n \u2265 319.\n\nSo, putting it all together, n must be an integer such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183.

To find the values of n that satisfy this, I can take reciprocals on all parts, but I have to remember that taking reciprocals reverses the inequalities. So, let's see: If I take reciprocals, the inequality becomes 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those, 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Now, to solve for n, I can divide all parts by \u03c0. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute those values. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.3098861. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.098861. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.3098861 and less than approximately 3183.098861. Since n has to be an integer, n can take integer values from 319 up to 3183. Now, to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1. Wait, let me think: The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1.

Then, I set up the inequality 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals, I got 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which seems correct. Then, dividing by \u03c0, I found the range for n, which is approximately 318.31 < n < 3183.098, so n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. Calculating the number of integers: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more, which gives 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. That seems right.

Taking reciprocals on both sides (and remembering that flipping the inequality when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive), we get 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Calculating 1/0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0: n < 10000/\u03c0. Similarly, the right side inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.

Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then minus 19 is 2864. Yes, that's correct. So, 2865 integers. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me think again. When x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a small interval near zero, the function sin(1/x) oscillates rapidly, and each oscillation crosses zero twice, except possibly at the endpoints. But in this case, we're looking for zeros where x = 1/(n\u03c0), so each n corresponds to exactly one zero crossing. So, the number of zeros is indeed equal to the number of integers n in that range.

    "text": " So, I can set up inequalities: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me solve for n here. First, let's invert all parts of the inequality, remembering to reverse the inequality signs because I'm dealing with positive numbers. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those, 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Now, divide all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute those values. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. Now, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, 3183 - 318 = 2865, then 2865 + 1 = 2866. Wait, but let me check that again. If n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, then the number of terms is 3183 - 318 = 2865, but since both 319 and 3183 are included, I think I should add 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me use the formula for the number of integers between a and b inclusive: it's b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when dealing with inequalities and integer counts, it's easy to make a mistake. So, starting with 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, the smallest integer n is 319 and the largest is 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, yes, 2865.

Let me take the reciprocals, remembering that taking reciprocals reverses the inequalities. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those, 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000.

Since n has to be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319, and the largest possible n is 3183. Now, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1, but wait, no, because 319 is the starting point, not 318. Let me think again. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So here, a = 319, b = 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, and 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check. Alternatively, I can compute how many numbers are between 319 and 3183. The number of integers from 1 to 3183 is 3183, and from 1 to 318 is 318, so subtracting gives 3183 - 318 = 2865. Yeah, that matches. So, there are 2865 integer values of n that satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the bounds. Let me check the initial substitution again. x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, so 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), then 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals, as I did before, gives 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 and less than 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.31 < n < 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183, inclusive. So, the number of n's is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me think again: when n increases by 1, x decreases, right? Because x = 1/(n\u03c0), so as n increases, x decreases. So, the smallest x in the interval is 0.0001, which corresponds to the largest n, and the largest x is 0.001, which corresponds to the smallest n. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. So, the number of intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made a mistake here.

I can solve this inequality for n to find the range of integers n that satisfy this condition. Let me rearrange the inequalities. Starting with the left part: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Taking reciprocals on both sides (remembering that this reverses the inequality because both sides are positive), I get: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Which simplifies to: 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0: n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.14159265, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.14159265 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n is an integer, n \u2264 3183. Now, looking at the right part of the inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals (and reversing the inequality): n\u03c0 > 1/0.001. Which is: n\u03c0 > 1000. Dividing both sides by \u03c0: n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 / 3.14159265 \u2248 318.3098862. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.3098862. Since n is an integer, n \u2265 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183, inclusive. Let me subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 318 = 2865, and 2865 + 1 = 2866. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my subtraction: 3183 - 319. Let's compute 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. Wait, so maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me do it more carefully: the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, a is 319, b is 3183. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n that satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But wait, let me double-check if n=319 is included. When n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0). Let's compute 319\u03c0: 319 * 3.14159265 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 319 * 3 = 957, 319 * 0.1416 \u2248 45.22, so total \u2248 957 + 45.22 \u2248 1002.22. So, x=1/1002.22 \u2248 0.0009977, which is less than 0.001 and greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Similarly, n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0). Let's compute 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 3183*3=9549, 3183*0.1416\u2248451. So, total \u2248 9549 + 451 \u2248 10000. So, x=1/10000=0.0001, but since the interval is open at 0.0001, we need to check if x=0.0001 is included. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x=0.0001 is not included, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but let me compute it more accurately. 3183\u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.0415926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, 3183 * 0.0015926535\u22485.06. So, total \u2248 318.3 + 127.32 + 5.06 \u2248 450.68. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9549 + 450.68 \u2248 9999.68. Therefore, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.68 \u2248 0.000100003, which is slightly greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n=3183 is included.

Let me take reciprocals, remembering to reverse the inequalities because reciprocating positive numbers reverses their order. So, taking reciprocals, we get 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those reciprocals: 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Now, to solve for n, I can divide each part by \u03c0. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values. First, 1000 divided by \u03c0. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535.

So, n must be an integer strictly greater than approximately 318.309886184 and strictly less than approximately 3183.09886184.

Wait, but I should make sure that when I take n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) is indeed greater than 0.0001, and when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.001.

Wait, but the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so it's open at 0.001. So, x must be less than 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so n=319 is the first integer where x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000998, which is less than 0.001, so it's inside the interval.

First, let's invert the inequalities, remembering that inverting reverses the inequalities. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those values: 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Now, divide each part by \u03c0 to solve for n. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute those values numerically. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, n must be greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184. So, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183. Now, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then add 1. Wait, no, let me think again. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, and 2864 + 1 = 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183.

So, each of these n's corresponds to an x-intercept in the given interval. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me think if I missed anything. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so I need to make sure that 1/(n\u03c0) is strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. So, n must satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Which is the same as n < 10000/\u03c0 and n > 1000/\u03c0. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184, so n starts at 319, and less than approximately 3183.09886184, so n goes up to 3183. So, yes, that's correct.

Let me rearrange each part of the inequality. Starting with the left side: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Taking reciprocals (and remembering to flip the inequality sign because reciprocating positive numbers reverses the inequality), we get 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Calculating 1/0.0001 gives 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, we get n < 10000/\u03c0. Similarly, for the right side: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals again, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n\u03c0 > 1000, which means n > 1000/\u03c0. Now, I can compute the numerical values. Let's calculate 10000 divided by \u03c0. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. Similarly, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.30988618 and less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n must be an integer, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, to find how many integers are in this range, we can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add one (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 integer values of n, each corresponding to an x-intercept in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).

The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

Starting with the left inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides (and remember that flipping the inequality because I'm dealing with positive numbers), I get 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. 1/0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, I get n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me calculate that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n is an integer, n \u2264 3183. Now, the right inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, 1/0.001 > n\u03c0. 1/0.001 is 1000, so 1000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, n < 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be less than approximately 318.30988618, meaning n \u2264 318. Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me check again. Wait, no, actually, when I take the reciprocal, the inequality flips, so 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies that n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618, so since n is an integer, n \u2265 319. Wait, that makes more sense. So, putting it together, n must satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Wait, that can't be right because 319 is much less than 3183. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inequalities. Let me go through it again. The original interval is 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), let's express this as 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let's solve for n in both inequalities. First inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Multiply both sides by n\u03c0 (which is positive, so inequality direction remains the same): 0.0001 * n\u03c0 < 1. Then, divide both sides by 0.0001: n\u03c0 < 1 / 0.0001 = 10000. So, n < 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618, so n \u2264 3183. Second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Multiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0. Then, divide both sides by 0.001: n\u03c0 > 1000. So, n > 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, so n \u2265 319. So, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183, inclusive. That's 3183 - 319 + 1 = let's compute that. 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 is 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n in that range, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. Let me take a specific example. Let's say n = 319. Then x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.14) \u2248 0.0009968, which is just above 0.0001 (which is 0.0001) and less than 0.001, so that's correct. Similarly, n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), it's open at 0.0001, so we need to check if 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Let me compute 1/(3183 * \u03c0). 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.1416 \u2248 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.0416 \u2248 132. So total \u2248 9549 + 318.3 + 132 \u2248 9999.3. So, 1/9999.3 \u2248 0.000100007, which is just barely above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. So, n = 3183 is included. Similarly, n = 319 gives x \u2248 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001. So, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive are valid. So, the total number is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n gives n between approximately 319 and 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Now, to solve for n, I'll divide each part by \u03c0. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute those values. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 1000 / 3.1415926535. Let me calculate that: 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 / \u03c0 is 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, n ranges from the smallest integer greater than 318.309886184 to the largest integer less than 3183.09886184. The smallest integer greater than 318.309886184 is 319, and the largest integer less than 3183.09886184 is 3183. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. Now, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 1000/\u03c0 is approximately 318.309886184, so the next integer is 319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 is approximately 3183.09886184, so the integer part is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183. The number of terms in this sequence is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more to get 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of it as starting at n=1, the x-intercepts are at x=1/(n\u03c0). As n increases, x decreases. So, the first x-intercept in the interval is when n is such that x=1/(n\u03c0) is just below 0.001, which would be n=319, and the last x-intercept is when x=1/(n\u03c0) is just above 0.0001, which is n=3183. So, the total number is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made a mistake here. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need to find the number of such x in (0.0001, 0.001). Solving 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 gives n between approximately 318.31 and 3183.098, so n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

So, substituting, we get 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Hmm, let's solve for n. First, let's take the reciprocal of all parts, but I need to remember that taking reciprocals reverses the inequalities. So, if I take reciprocals, I get 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those, 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Now, I can divide all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values numerically to get an idea of the range of n. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184.

So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. To find the number of integers from a to b inclusive, we can compute b - a + 1. So, plugging in the numbers, 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers in this range. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations. Let me double-check the reciprocals. So, the original interval is 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), then 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals, which reverses the inequalities, so 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing by \u03c0, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098.

So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, let me consider whether each n in that range gives a unique x in the interval. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), and as n increases, x decreases, so each n corresponds to a unique x in the interval. Also, since n starts at 319, which gives x \u2248 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000996, which is just under 0.001, and n ends at 3183, which gives x \u2248 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999, which is just over 0.0001.

Let me first find the range of n. I can rewrite the inequalities as 1/(0.001) > n\u03c0 > 1/(0.0001). Calculating 1/0.001, that's 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 > n\u03c0 > 10000. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 1/0.001 is 1000, so 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies that n\u03c0 > 1000, so n > 1000/\u03c0. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies that n\u03c0 < 10000, so n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me calculate those values. First, 1000 divided by \u03c0. Since \u03c0 is approximately 3.14159, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309 and less than approximately 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n can take integer values from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, from 319 to 3183, that would be 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 integer values of n, each corresponding to an x-intercept in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but I should double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through again. The function is y = sin(1/x). We set sin(1/x) = 0, so 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. Therefore, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and remembering to reverse the inequalities because reciprocals reverse the order), we get 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Then, dividing by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. As calculated earlier, that's approximately 318.309 < n < 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, yes, 2865 x-intercepts. I think that's correct. Wait, but let me check if n=319 gives x within the interval. x = 1/(319\u03c0). Let me compute 319\u03c0: 319 * 3.14159 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's see, 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477, 19\u03c0 \u2248 59.690, so total \u2248 942.477 + 59.690 \u2248 1002.167. So, 1/x \u2248 1002.167, so x \u2248 1/1002.167 \u2248 0.0009978, which is approximately 0.0009978, which is greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. Similarly, n=3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0). Let's compute 3183\u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's see, 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77, 183\u03c0 \u2248 575.46, so total \u2248 9424.77 + 575.46 \u2248 10,000.23. So, x \u2248 1/10,000.23 \u2248 0.000099997, which is just below 0.0001. Wait, that's a problem. Because x needs to be greater than 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n can be up to 3183, but when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099997, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. Therefore, the maximum n should be such that x > 0.0001, so n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, the maximum integer n is 3183, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n should be 3182. Wait, let me check n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0). Let's compute 3182\u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's see, 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77, 182\u03c0 \u2248 572.34, so total \u2248 9424.77 + 572.34 \u2248 10,000.11. So, x \u2248 1/10,000.11 \u2248 0.0000999989, which is still less than 0.0001. Hmm, so maybe I need to find n such that x > 0.0001, which is 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n can be up to 3183, but x for n=3183 is still less than 0.0001. Therefore, the maximum n that gives x > 0.0001 is n=3183-1=3182? Wait, but 1/(3182\u03c0) is still less than 0.0001. Hmm, maybe I need to find the smallest n such that x < 0.001 and the largest n such that x > 0.0001. Alternatively, perhaps I should set up the inequalities correctly. Let me start over. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001). So, x must satisfy 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), we have 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities): 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. As calculated earlier, that's approximately 318.309 < n < 3183.098. Therefore, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. But wait, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099997, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. So, the maximum n that gives x > 0.0001 is the largest integer less than 3183.098, which is 3183, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) is still less than 0.0001. Therefore, the maximum n that gives x > 0.0001 is actually n= floor(10000/\u03c0) -1? Wait, no. Let me compute 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, the maximum integer n is 3183, but as we saw, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n that satisfies x > 0.0001 is n=3183 -1=3182? But let's check n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182*3.14159) \u2248 1/(10,000.098) \u2248 0.000099999, which is still less than 0.0001. Hmm, so maybe I need to find n such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. Therefore, n can be up to 3183, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, but x=1/(3182\u03c0) is still less than 0.0001. Wait, this seems like a problem. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think differently. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001). So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. Therefore, 1/x must be between 1000 and 10000. Because as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000. So, 1/x is in (1000, 10000). Therefore, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.309 < n < 3183.098. Therefore, n can be integers from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. Now, how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive? It's 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. But wait, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099997, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not in the interval. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, but x=1/(3182\u03c0) is still less than 0.0001. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let me find the smallest n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Wait, no, I need x > 0.0001 and x < 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) must be between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. Therefore, n can be from 319 to 3183, inclusive. But when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099997, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. Let me check n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182*3.14159) \u2248 1/(10,000.098) \u2248 0.000099999, which is still less than 0.0001. So, even n=3182 gives x less than 0.0001. So, how about n=3181? x=1/(3181\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3181*3.14159) \u2248 1/(10,000.098 - 3.14159) \u2248 1/(9996.956) \u2248 0.00010003, which is just over 0.0001. So, n=3181 gives x\u22480.00010003, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, the maximum n is 3181, because n=3182 gives x less than 0.0001, which is excluded. Similarly, the minimum n is 319, because n=319 gives x\u22480.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Wait, but earlier I thought n=319 gives x\u22480.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, now, the range of n is from 319 to 3181, inclusive. Let me compute how many integers that is. 3181 - 319 + 1 = 3181 - 319 = 2862, plus 1 is 2863. Wait, that's different from before. So, initially, I thought n went up to 3183, but since n=3183 gives x less than 0.0001, which is excluded, the maximum n is 3181. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2863. Hmm, this is conflicting with my earlier conclusion. Let me make sure. Let me compute n=3181: x=1/(3181\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3181*3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10,000.098) \u2248 0.000099999, but wait, that's actually less than 0.0001. Wait, no, 1/(3181\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3181*3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10,000.098) \u2248 0.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, n=3181 gives x less than 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n that gives x > 0.0001 is n=3180. Let me check n=3180: x=1/(3180\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3180*3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10,000.098 - 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(9996.956) \u2248 0.00010003, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, n can be from 319 to 3180, inclusive. Now, let's compute the number of integers from 319 to 3180 inclusive. That's 3180 - 319 + 1 = 3180 - 319 = 2861, plus 1 is 2862. Wait, but let me check n=3180: x=1/(3180\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010003, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included. And n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, the number of n's is 3180 - 319 + 1 = 2862. But wait, earlier I thought it was 2863, but now it's 2862. I think the confusion arises because when you take n from 319 to 3180 inclusive, the count is 3180 - 319 + 1 = 2862. Let me confirm with smaller numbers. For example, how many integers from 5 to 10 inclusive? 10 - 5 +1=6, which is correct: 5,6,7,8,9,10. So, applying that formula, from 319 to 3180, it's 3180 - 319 +1=2862. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2862. But wait, earlier I thought n=3183 gives x less than 0.0001, so it's excluded, and n=3180 gives x just over 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3180, inclusive, giving 2862 x-intercepts. But wait, let me check n=3180: 3180\u03c0 \u2248 3180*3.1415926535\u224810,000.098. So, x=1/(3180\u03c0)\u22480.000099999, which is less than 0.0001. Wait, that's a problem. Because 1/(3180\u03c0)\u22480.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, n=3180 gives x less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n that gives x > 0.0001 is n=3179. Let me check n=3179: x=1/(3179\u03c0)\u22481/(3179*3.1415926535)\u22481/(10,000.098 - 3.1415926535)\u22481/(9996.956)\u22480.00010003, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, n can be from 319 to 3179, inclusive. Now, the number of integers is 3179 - 319 +1=3179-319=2860, plus 1 is 2861. Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let me solve for n in 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.098. And 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n > 1000/\u03c0\u2248318.309. Therefore, n must satisfy 318.309 < n < 3183.098. So, n can be integers from 319 to 3183, inclusive. But when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000099997<0.0001, so it's excluded. Similarly, n=3182: x\u22480.000099999<0.0001, excluded. n=3181: x\u22480.00010003>0.0001, included. So, the maximum n is 3181. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3181, inclusive. The number of integers is 3181 - 319 +1=3181-319=2862, plus 1=2863. Wait, but earlier I thought n=3181 gives x\u22480.00010003, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included. So, n=3181 is included. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2863. But let me confirm with n=3181: 3181\u03c0\u22483181*3.1415926535\u224810,000.098. So, x=1/(3181\u03c0)\u22480.000099999, which is less than 0.0001. Wait, that contradicts my earlier calculation. Wait, no, 1/(3181\u03c0)\u22481/10,000.098\u22480.000099999, which is less than 0.0001. Therefore, n=3181 gives x less than 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n that gives x > 0.0001 is n=3180: x=1/(3180\u03c0)\u22480.000099999, which is still less than 0.0001. Therefore, n=3180 is excluded. So, n=3179: x=1/(3179\u03c0)\u22480.00010003>0.0001, included. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3179, inclusive. Number of integers: 3179 - 319 +1=3179-319=2860, plus 1=2861. But wait, let me check n=3179: 3179\u03c0\u22483179*3.1415926535\u224810,000.098 - 3.1415926535\u22489996.956. So, x=1/9996.956\u22480.00010003>0.0001, included. So, n=3179 is included. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2861. But I'm getting inconsistent results because the exact value of n where x crosses 0.0001 is not an integer. Therefore, I need a precise way to calculate the number of n's such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me express it as inequalities:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098\n\nand\n\n1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309\n\nTherefore, n must satisfy 318.309 < n < 3183.098.\n\nSince n must be an integer, n can be from 319 to 3183, inclusive.\n\nBut wait, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000099997<0.0001, so it's excluded.\n\nSimilarly, when n=3182, x\u22480.000099999<0.0001, excluded.\n\nn=3181: x\u22480.00010003>0.0001, included.\n\nTherefore, the maximum n is 3181.\n\nSimilarly, the minimum n is 319, which gives x\u22480.0009978<0.001, included.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3181, inclusive.\n\nNumber of integers: 3181 - 319 +1=2863.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n=3181 gives x\u22480.00010003>0.0001, which is included, so it's correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2863.\n\nBut let me confirm with exact calculations.\n\nCompute 1/(3181\u03c0):\n\n\u03c0\u22483.141592653589793\n\n3181\u03c0\u22483181*3.141592653589793\u224810,000.0984166\n\nTherefore, 1/(3181\u03c0)\u22481/10,000.0984166\u22480.0000999990158, which is approximately 0.000099999, which is less than 0.0001.\n\nWait, that's a problem because 0.000099999 is less than 0.0001, so n=3181 gives x less than 0.0001, which is excluded.\n\nTherefore, the maximum n that gives x > 0.0001 is n=3180: x=1/(3180\u03c0)\u22481/(3180*3.141592653589793)\u22481/(10,000.0984166 - 3.141592653589793)\u22481/9996.956824\u22480.0001000305, which is approximately 0.00010003, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nTherefore, n=3180 gives x\u22480.00010003>0.0001, included.\n\nSimilarly, n=3179: x=1/(3179\u03c0)\u22481/(3179*3.141592653589793)\u22481/(10,000.0984166 - 6.283185307)\u22481/9993.815231\u22480.000100062, which is also greater than 0.0001, included.\n\nWait, so n=3180 gives x\u22480.00010003>0.0001, included.\n\nn=3181: x\u22480.000099999<0.0001, excluded.\n\nTherefore, the maximum n is 3180.\n\nSimilarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.0009978<0.001, included.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3180, inclusive.\n\nNumber of integers: 3180 - 319 +1=3180 -319=2861, plus 1=2862.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n=3180 gives x\u22480.00010003>0.0001, included, so n=3180 is included.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2862.\n\nBut let me make sure.\n\nCompute n=3180: x=1/(3180\u03c0)=1/(3180*3.141592653589793)=1/(10,000.0984166)=\u22480.0000999990158<0.0001, so it's excluded.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, no, 1/(3180\u03c0)=1/(3180*3.141592653589793)=1/(10,000.0984166)=\u22480.0000999990158, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded.\n\nTherefore, n=3180 gives x less than 0.0001, excluded.\n\nTherefore, the maximum n that gives x > 0.0001 is n=3179: x=1/(3179\u03c0)\u22480.000100062>0.0001, included.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3179, inclusive.\n\nNumber of integers: 3179 - 319 +1=3179 -319=2860, plus 1=2861.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2861.\n\nWait, but let me check n=3179: 3179\u03c0\u22483179*3.141592653589793\u224810,000.0984166 - 3.141592653589793\u22489996.956824.\n\nSo, x=1/9996.956824\u22480.0001000305>0.0001, included.\n\nSimilarly, n=3180: x\u22480.000099999<0.0001, excluded.\n\nTherefore, n=3179 is the maximum n that gives x > 0.0001.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3179, inclusive.\n\nNumber of integers: 3179 - 319 +1=2861.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2861.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought n=3181 gives x\u22480.00010003>0.0001, but upon exact calculation, n=3181 gives x\u22480.000099999<0.0001, so it's excluded.\n\nTherefore, the correct number is 2861.\n\nWait, but let me check n=3179: 3179\u03c0\u224810,000.0984166 - 3.141592653589793\u22489996.956824.\n\nSo, x=1/9996.956824\u22480.0001000305>0.0001, included.\n\nSimilarly, n=3180: x\u22480.000099999<0.0001, excluded.\n\nTherefore, n=3179 is included, n=3180 is excluded.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3179 - 319 +1=2861.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 2861.\n\nWait, but let me make sure.

First, let's invert the inequalities, remembering that inverting reverses the inequalities since all terms are positive. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those, 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Now, divide all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be an integer strictly greater than approximately 318.30988618 and strictly less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319 and the largest possible n is 3183. Now, to find how many integers are between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, no, actually, since the lower bound is 319, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n that satisfy the inequality, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts in the given interval. Let me double-check my reasoning to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, starting from sin(1/x) = 0, we get x = 1/(n\u03c0). Then, x must be between 0.0001 and 0.001, so 1/(n\u03c0) is between those two values, which leads to n being between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0. Calculating those gives me approximately 318.31 and 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. That seems correct. I don't think I missed anything here. So, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. To find the number of such x in (0.0001, 0.001), we solve 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, leading to 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. The number of integers n is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"
