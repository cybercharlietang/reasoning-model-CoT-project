Since sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0, but in our case, x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a small interval near zero. So, as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001, 1/x increases from 1000 to 10000. So, the function sin(1/x) will oscillate more and more rapidly as x approaches 0.0001. Each time 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0, we get an x-intercept. So, the number of times sin(1/x) crosses zero is equal to the number of multiples of \u03c0 that 1/x passes through as x goes from 0.001 to 0.0001. So, 1/x goes from 1000 to 10000, so the number of \u03c0 multiples in that interval is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0). Let me compute that. 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so ceil(1000/\u03c0) = 319. 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so floor(10000/\u03c0) = 3183. Therefore, the number of zeros is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, that's consistent with what I found earlier. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check with specific values. Let's take n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.00099784, which is within (0.0001, 0.001). n=320: x\u22481/(320\u03c0)\u22480.0009917, still within. ... and so on, up to n=3183: x\u22480.0001000031, which is just above 0.0001. So, each n from 319 to 3183 gives a valid x in the interval. Therefore, the total number is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

Wait, but another way to think about it is that the function sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches zero, and the number of oscillations increases as x gets smaller. So, between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a factor of 10 difference, the number of oscillations would be proportional to the reciprocal of x. So, the number of zeros would be roughly the difference in 1/x values divided by \u03c0. So, 1/0.001 = 1000, and 1/0.0001 = 10000, so the difference is 9000, divided by \u03c0 gives approximately 2866, which is close to 2865, so that makes sense.

But let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The function is y = sin(1/x). We're looking for x in (0.0001, 0.001) where sin(1/x)=0. That happens when 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n, we find n must be between approximately 318.309 and 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, the graph of y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me think about the behavior of the function near the endpoints. As x approaches 0.0001 from the right, 1/x approaches 10000, so sin(1/x) oscillates very rapidly between -1 and 1. Similarly, as x approaches 0.001 from the left, 1/x approaches 1000, so sin(1/x) oscillates rapidly as well. But between x=0.0001 and x=0.001, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000, which is a range of 9000 radians. Since each period of sin(\u03b8) is 2\u03c0, the number of oscillations is roughly 9000/(2\u03c0) \u2248 1432. So, each oscillation has two x-intercepts (one when going up, one when going down). Wait, but that would suggest about 2864 x-intercepts, which is close to the number I got earlier, 2865. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, I think 2865 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The number of zeros of sin(\u03b8) between \u03b8 = a and \u03b8 = b is roughly (b - a)/(\u03c0), because between each \u03c0 interval, there's one zero. So, from \u03b8 = 1000 to \u03b8 = 10000, the number of zeros would be approximately (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 \u2248 9000/3.1416 \u2248 2866. So, that's about 2866 zeros. But since we're dealing with open intervals, maybe it's 2865. Hmm, that seems to align with my earlier calculation. So, that gives me more confidence that 2865 is the correct number.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had 2865, which is exactly (3183 - 319 +1). So, I think that's correct.

Therefore, in any interval near zero, there are infinitely many oscillations, but in this case, we're looking at a specific interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a small interval near zero but not including zero. So, the function will oscillate between -1 and 1, crossing the x-axis each time sin(1/x) = 0, which happens at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer n. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in (0.0001, 0.001). Which brings us back to the same calculation.

Solving for n, we find n ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

So, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but just to make sure, let me think about the behavior of the function. As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly between -1 and 1. Therefore, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is close to zero, the function oscillates very rapidly. Each oscillation crosses the x-axis twice, but wait, no, each full period of sine is 2\u03c0, so each period would cross the x-axis twice. Wait, but in this case, we're dealing with 1/x, so as x decreases, the frequency increases. Each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the sine function completes half a period, going from 0 to 0. So, each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, we get another x-intercept. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts in the interval (a, b) where a < b would be the number of times 1/x passes through multiples of \u03c0 as x decreases from b to a. So, the number of zeros would be the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is between a and b. Which is exactly what I calculated earlier. So, the number of zeros is indeed the number of integers n where 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001), which gives n from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 x-intercepts.
