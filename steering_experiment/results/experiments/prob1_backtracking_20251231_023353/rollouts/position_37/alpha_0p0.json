Therefore, there are 2865 integer values of n, each corresponding to an x-intercept in the given interval. But wait, I should make sure that each n in this range gives an x within (0.0001, 0.001). Let me test n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.37) \u2248 0.0009976, which is approximately 0.0009976, which is between 0.0001 and 0.001. Similarly, n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.00) \u2248 0.0001, but wait, 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10000, so x is approximately 0.0001. But our interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since it's exactly 0.0001 when n = 3183\u03c0, but 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10000, so x is just slightly less than 0.0001? Wait, no, because 3183\u03c0 is 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000, so x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, x must be greater than 0.0001. So, does n = 3183 give x just above 0.0001 or just below? Let's compute it more accurately. Let me calculate 3183 * \u03c0: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.1416 \u2248 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, 3183 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0928, so adding up: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.0928 \u2248 450.7128. So total is 9549 + 450.7128 \u2248 9999.7128. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.7128, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.7128 \u2248 0.0001000028. So, x \u2248 0.0001000028, which is just slightly above 0.0001. So, since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, does 0.0001000028 count? Wait, the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so it's open at both ends, meaning x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 0.0001000028 is greater than 0.0001, so it does count. Similarly, for n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.37) \u2248 0.0009976, which is less than 0.001, so that's within the interval. So, both n = 319 and n = 3183 give x within the interval. Therefore, the total number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the subtraction. 3183 - 319: Let's compute 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865.

If n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183, inclusive, then the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2865. So, that would mean there are 2865 integer values of n, each corresponding to an x-intercept in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But wait, I should verify if both endpoints are included correctly. Let me test with a smaller example. Suppose n ranges from 2 to 5, inclusive. Then the number of integers is 5 - 2 + 1 = 4, which is correct: 2,3,4,5. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me check if 1/(319\u03c0) is indeed greater than 0.0001 and 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.001. Let's compute 1/(319\u03c0): \u03c0 \u2248 3.1416, so 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 Let me compute 300*3.1416 = 942.48, and 19*3.1416 \u2248 59.6904, so total \u2248 942.48 + 59.6904 \u2248 1002.1704. So, 1/1002.1704 \u2248 0.0009978, which is approximately 0.0009978, which is less than 0.001. Wait, but we have 0.0001 < x < 0.001, so x must be greater than 0.0001. So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009978, which is less than 0.001, but is it greater than 0.0001? Yes, because 0.0009978 is greater than 0.0001. Similarly, 1/(3183\u03c0): 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 Let's see, 3000*3.1416=9424.8, 183*3.1416\u2248183*3=549, 183*0.1416\u224825.9428, so total \u2248 549 + 25.9428 \u2248 574.9428. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.8 + 574.9428 \u2248 9999.7428. So, 1/(9999.7428) \u2248 0.0001000025, which is just slightly above 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000025, which is within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n=3183 gives x \u2248 0.0001000025, which is just above 0.0001, and n=319 gives x \u2248 0.0009978, which is just below 0.001. Therefore, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive correspond to x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.

Since n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183, inclusive, the count is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Alternatively, I can think of it as starting from 1, the number of integers from 1 to 3183 is 3183, and from 1 to 318 is 318, so subtracting gives 3183 - 318 = 2865. Wait, that's a different approach but arrives at the same answer. So, 2865 x-intercepts. But let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 1/(0.0001\u03c0) is 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n must be less than that, so the maximum integer n is 3183. Similarly, 1/(0.001\u03c0) is 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n must be greater than that, so the minimum integer n is 319. Therefore, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then +1 is 2865. So, 2865 x-intercepts. But wait, let me think if there's any possibility that the endpoints might not actually be included. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. So, let me check if x = 1/(n\u03c0) could equal exactly 0.0001 or 0.001, which would mean n = 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, which is not an integer, so the closest integer is 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) would be slightly larger than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. Similarly, x = 1/(319\u03c0) would be slightly less than 0.001, so included as well. Therefore, all n from 319 to 3183 are valid, and the total number is 2865. Wait, but let me make sure that 1/(319\u03c0) is less than 0.001 and 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Let me compute 1/(319\u03c0): 1/(319 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(1002.3) \u2248 0.0009977, which is just under 0.001, so it's included. Similarly, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but slightly larger, so it's included.

Therefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). I think that makes sense, but let me double-check. The interval from x = 0.0001 to x = 0.001 corresponds to 1/x going from 10000 down to 1000. So, 1/x is decreasing from 10000 to 1000 as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001. So, sin(1/x) will oscillate between -1 and 1 as 1/x decreases. Each time 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0, we get an x-intercept. The number of such crossings is the number of times 1/x passes through n\u03c0 for integer n. So, n starts at the smallest integer where n\u03c0 > 1000 and goes up to the largest integer where n\u03c0 < 10000. Wait, hold on, that might be a better way to think about it. Let me see. Since 1/x is going from 10000 to 1000, the values of n\u03c0 must lie between 1000 and 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n must be between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.309 < n < 3183.098, which is the same as before.

    "text": " 3183 - 319: Let's break it down. 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. So, 2864 + 1 = 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Each of these n corresponds to an x-intercept in the given interval. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, let me just verify that. So, starting from n=319, which gives x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.73) \u2248 0.000996, which is just above 0.0001. Similarly, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.004) \u2248 0.000099996, which is just below 0.0001, but wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, actually, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 1/(3183*3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000) \u2248 0.0001. But since 3183 is the upper limit, the corresponding x would be just above 0.0001. Wait, no, actually, 3183 is the upper n, so x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001. So, perhaps n needs to be such that x > 0.0001, so n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.000099996, which is less than 0.0001, so actually, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but does x=1/(3183\u03c0) lie within (0.0001, 0.001)? Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0). 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.1416 \u2248 450. So total \u2248 9549 + 450 \u2248 10,000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10,000 = 0.0001. So, x=0.0001 is the lower bound, but the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is not included in the interval. So, the largest n for which x > 0.0001 is n=3182? Wait, let me check that. If n=3183, x\u22480.0001, which is not included. So, the next lower n would be 3182, which would give x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182*3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000 - a bit) \u2248 0.00010008, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. Wait, that seems contradictory. Let me compute 1/(3182\u03c0). 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 Let's compute 3182 * 3 = 9546, 3182 * 0.1416 \u2248 3182 * 0.1 = 318.2, 3182 * 0.0416 \u2248 approx 3182 * 0.04 = 127.28, so total approx 318.2 + 127.28 \u2248 445.48. So total \u03c0 * 3182 \u2248 9546 + 445.48 \u2248 10,  (Wait, 9546 + 445.48 is 9991.48). So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9991.48 \u2248 0.00010008, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n=3182 is included, but n=3183 would give x\u22480.0001, which is not included. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. Similarly, the minimum n is 319, as before. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Now, how many integers is that? It's 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 is 2864. So, there are 2864 integers n from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial calculation by including n=3183, which actually doesn't satisfy x > 0.0001. So, the correct count is from 319 to 3182, which is 2864. Let me double-check. The lower bound: n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309, so n starts at 319. The upper bound: n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so n ends at 3183, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded, so the last n is 3182. So, the number of terms is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864. Alternatively, I can think of it as the number of integers between a and b inclusive is b - a +1. So, 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, the answer should be 2864. But wait, let me think again. Let's take a small example to see if this works. Suppose I have n from 3 to 5 inclusive. That's 3,4,5: 3 numbers. 5 -3 +1=3. So, correct. Similarly, from 319 to 3182 inclusive, it's 3182 -319 +1=2864. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. We need to find n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n gives n between approximately 319 and 3182. The number of integers in this range is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}."

Let me double-check the values: 1/(0.0001\u03c0) is indeed 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n must be less than that, so the maximum n is 3183.

But just to be thorough, let me consider n starting at 319 and ending at 3183. The number of terms in this sequence is 3183 - 319 + 1. Alternatively, it's the same as (3183 - 318) - (319 - 1) + 1? Wait, no, that might complicate things. Alternatively, think of it as starting at n=1, up to n=3183, which is 3183 numbers, then subtract the numbers from n=1 to n=318, which is 318 numbers. So, 3183 - 318 = 2865. That's another way to see it. So, that confirms the number is 2865. Therefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).

Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the range of n. So, when x is 0.0001, 1/x is 10000, and when x is 0.001, 1/x is 1000. So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. So, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000. So, n must be between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.309 to 3183.098, as I had before. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again. 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. That seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that between 1000 and 10000, how many multiples of \u03c0 are there? The number of zeros of sin(\u03b8) between \u03b8 = a and \u03b8 = b is approximately (b - a)/\u03c0, but since we're dealing with integers, it's the floor of b/\u03c0 minus the ceiling of a/\u03c0. Wait, let me see. The number of zeros is the number of integers n such that n\u03c0 is in [a, b]. So, the smallest n where n\u03c0 \u2265 a is n = ceil(a/\u03c0), and the largest n where n\u03c0 \u2264 b is n = floor(b/\u03c0). So, the number of such n is floor(b/\u03c0) - ceil(a/\u03c0) + 1. In this case, a = 1000, b = 10000. So, ceil(1000/\u03c0) = ceil(318.309) = 319, and floor(10000/\u03c0) = floor(3183.098) = 3183. So, number of n is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865, same as before. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches zero, and in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is quite close to zero, it oscillates rapidly. Each oscillation crosses the x-axis twice, but since we're considering x-intercepts, each zero crossing corresponds to a single x-intercept. Wait, no, actually, sin(1/x) crosses zero once between each peak and trough, so each zero crossing is a single intercept. So, the number of zeros is equal to the number of times 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0. So, each n corresponds to one zero. So, the total number is 2865.\n\nWait, but another thought: when 1/x increases from 1000 to 10000, the number of times sin(1/x) crosses zero is equal to the number of times 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0, which is essentially the number of integers n where n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000. So, that's exactly what I computed before, which is 2865. So, that seems correct.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, leading to x = 1/(n\u03c0). Within the interval (0.0001, 0.001), 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. The integers n satisfying 1000 \u2264 n\u03c0 \u2264 10000 are from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 x-intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

So, the smallest x is 0.0001, which corresponds to the largest n, and the largest x is 0.001, which corresponds to the smallest n in the range.

Let me verify the calculations. 1/(0.0001\u03c0) is indeed 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n must be less than that. Since n must be an integer, the maximum n is 3183.

Hmm, but wait a second. I should make sure that each n corresponds to a unique x in the interval. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), as n increases, x decreases. So, the smallest x is 1/(3183\u03c0) and the largest x is 1/(319\u03c0). Let me check if these x values are within (0.0001, 0.001). Let's compute 1/(319\u03c0): 1/(319 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(1003.05) \u2248 0.000997, which is just under 0.001, so that's good. Now, 1/(3183\u03c0): 1/(3183 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000, 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001, which is 0.0001. Wait, but our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, does x = 1/(3183\u03c0) fall into the interval? Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0): 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's see, 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77, 183\u03c0 \u2248 575.02, so total \u2248 9424.77 + 575.02 \u2248 10,000 approximately. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, x must be greater than 0.0001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so n must be less than that, meaning the maximum n is 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001? Wait, no, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but actually, 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001 because 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001. Therefore, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, which is outside the interval. So, the smallest n that gives x > 0.0001 is n = 319, as previously determined, because 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000997, which is greater than 0.0001. Wait, no, 0.000997 is less than 0.001, but 0.000997 is greater than 0.0001, so that's fine. Wait, no, 0.000997 is 0.000997, which is 9.97e-4, which is greater than 0.0001 (1e-4) and less than 0.001 (1e-3). So, x=1/(319\u03c0) is indeed within the interval. So, the number of n's is from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the count is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, 2865 intercepts. But wait, let me make sure that I'm not including n=3183, because x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. Therefore, the largest n that gives x < 0.001 is n=319, but wait no, actually, when n increases, x decreases. So, the largest n is the one where x is just above 0.0001. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Substituting x = 1/(n\u03c0), we get: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n:\n\nFrom 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0), we get n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098.\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, we get n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309.\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nBut wait, let's check if n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) which is approximately 0.0001, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001. So, does x=1/(3183\u03c0) equal exactly 0.0001? Let's compute 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265. Let's compute 3000*\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, and 183*\u03c0 \u2248 575.01656, so total \u2248 9424.77796 + 575.01656 \u2248 10000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000, 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001, which is 0.0001 exactly. So, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. Therefore, the largest n that gives x > 0.0001 is n=3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) would be slightly larger than 0.0001. Wait, no, let me check:\n\nWait, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.000 something, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 - a tiny bit, so it's less than 0.0001. Therefore, to have x > 0.0001, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n that gives x > 0.0001 is n=3182. Wait, no, because 1/(3182\u03c0) would be slightly larger than 0.0001, since 3182\u03c0 is slightly less than 10000. So, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 10000 - (\u03c0/3183) \u2248 10000 - 0.000997, so 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9999.999, so 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010001, which is just over 0.0001. So, n=3182 gives x\u22480.00010001, which is in the interval. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, and the minimum n is 319.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n goes up to 3183, but that gives x less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the correct range is n from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\nLet me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864.\n\nWait, that's different from before.

Let's compute 1/(3183\u03c0):\n\n3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265.\n\nLet me compute 3000*\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, and 183*\u03c0 \u2248 575.01656, so total \u2248 9424.77796 + 575.01656 \u2248 10000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000, 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the largest n that gives x > 0.0001 is n=3182, as 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010001, which is just over 0.0001.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive.

The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is quite close to zero, the function oscillates rapidly. Each oscillation corresponds to a zero crossing when 1/x increases by \u03c0. So, each zero crossing occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0), as we determined.\n\nSo, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nWhich simplifies to 318.309 < n < 3183.098.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded, so the maximum n is 3182.\n\nThus, the number of n's is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I considered whether n=3183 should be included, but since x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, it's excluded, so we stop at n=3182.\n\nSo, the final answer is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3182. The number of integers in this range is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\n$\\boxed{2864}$"

Therefore, there are 2865 integer values of n, which correspond to 2865 x-intercepts in the given interval. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. When x is in (0.0001, 0.001), 1/x is in (1000, 10000). So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. Since sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 is a multiple of \u03c0, the number of zeros in \u03b8 between 1000 and 10000 is equal to the number of integers n such that 1000 \u2264 n\u03c0 \u2264 10000. So, solving for n, we get n between 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, which is the same as before.

Therefore, there are 2865 integer values of n in this range, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the range. The original interval is from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is a very narrow interval near zero. As x approaches zero from the right, 1/x approaches positive infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. But since we're only looking between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a finite interval, the number of zeros should be finite. But 2865 seems quite large. Let me double-check my calculations. Let's recalculate the bounds for n. Starting with x = 1/(n\u03c0). For x = 0.001, n is 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. For x = 0.0001, n is 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the largest integer n is 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, sometimes when counting integers, it's easy to miscount, so let me consider a smaller example. Suppose n ranges from 2 to 5 inclusive. The numbers are 2,3,4,5.

The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So here, a is 319, b is 3183. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that would mean there are 2865 x-intercepts in that interval. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, x = 1/(n\u03c0) must satisfy 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me solve for n again to confirm. Starting with 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0): Multiply both sides by n\u03c0: 0.0001n\u03c0 < 1 => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618 So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618, so the maximum integer n is 3183. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => Multiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001n\u03c0 => n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618 So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618, so the minimum integer n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me think again. Because as x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is between 1/10000 and 1/1000, the function sin(1/x) will oscillate between 0 and 1, crossing the x-axis each time 1/x passes through an integer multiple of \u03c0. So, each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, we get another zero crossing. So, the number of zeros should be roughly the number of times 1/x crosses multiples of \u03c0 as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001. Wait, but I think I might have a mistake here. Because when x increases, 1/x decreases, so as x goes from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x goes from 10000 down to 1000. So, the function sin(1/x) starts oscillating rapidly near x=0.0001 and slows down as x approaches 0.001. So, the number of zeros in this interval would correspond to the number of times 1/x passes through n\u03c0 for n from 1000 down to 10000, but wait, no, because x is in (0.0001, 0.001), which is (1/10000, 1/1000). So, 1/x is in (1000, 10000). So, 1/x goes from 1000 to 10000 as x goes from 0.001 to 0.0001. Wait, but x is increasing from 0.0001 to 0.001, so 1/x is decreasing from 10000 to 1000. So, 1/x starts at 10000 when x=0.0001 and decreases to 1000 when x=0.001. So, sin(1/x) will cross zero each time 1/x passes through n\u03c0, where n is an integer. So, we need to find all integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Because 1/x is decreasing from 10000 to 1000, so n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 and less than 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute those values. 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, so n must be greater than that, so n \u2265 319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618, so n must be less than that, so n \u2264 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers n is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me think again. Because each time n increases by 1, 1/x crosses another multiple of \u03c0, resulting in another zero crossing. So, the number of crossings is the number of n's in that range. So, yes, 2865. Hmm, but let me check with specific values to make sure. Let's take n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.14) \u2248 0.0009969, which is just above 0.0001 (since 0.0001 is 0.0001, which is 0.0001, and 0.0009969 is about 0.000997, which is greater than 0.0001). Wait, no, 0.000997 is greater than 0.0001, so x=1/(319\u03c0) is approximately 0.000997, which is within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but since the interval is open at 0.0001, we have to check if x=1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0): 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 3183*3=9549, 3183*0.1416\u22483183*0.1=318.3, 3183*0.0416\u2248132.2, so total \u22489549+318.3+132.2\u22489999.5. So, 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22481/9999.5\u22480.000100005, which is just above 0.0001, so it's within the interval. Similarly, for n=3184: x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22481/(10002.2)\u22480.000099978, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. Therefore, n=3183 is the largest n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) is still greater than 0.0001. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n.

Therefore, there are 2865 integer values of n, which correspond to 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But wait, let me think again. Is that correct? Because when I substituted x = 1/(n\u03c0), I considered n starting at 319 and ending at 3183, which gives 2865 values. But let me confirm whether the endpoints are included or not. The interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. Therefore, I should check whether x = 1/(319\u03c0) and x = 1/(3183\u03c0) are within the interval. Let me compute 1/(319\u03c0): 1/(319 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(1002.8) \u2248 0.000997, which is approximately 0.001, but since the interval is up to 0.001, and it's open, 0.000997 is less than 0.001, so it's included. Similarly, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) \u2248 0.0001, but again, the interval starts above 0.0001, so 0.0001 is excluded. Wait, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but let me compute more accurately. 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 Let me compute 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.14159265 \u2248 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.04159265 \u2248 let's see, 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, 3183 * 0.00159265 \u2248 5.06. So total \u2248 318.3 + 127.32 + 5.06 \u2248 450.68. So total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9549 + 450.68 \u2248 9999.68, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.68 \u2248 0.0001000032, which is just above 0.0001. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 0.0001000032 is just barely above 0.0001, so it's included. Similarly, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.8) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Therefore, both n=319 and n=3183 correspond to x-values within the interval. So, the count remains 2865. Wait, but let me check the exact values again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recast the inequalities. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities because reciprocating positive numbers reverses the inequality): 10000 > n\u03c0 > 1000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Then, dividing all parts by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098861, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098862. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.3098861 and less than approximately 3183.098862. Since n must be an integer, the smallest integer greater than 318.3098861 is 319, and the largest integer less than 3183.098862 is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts. But wait, let me think again. Is there a possibility that some of these n's could result in x outside the interval? For example, does n=319 give x=1/(319\u03c0) which is approximately 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so yes, included. Similarly, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001000032, which is greater than 0.0001, so included. So, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive give x in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the total number is 2865. Hmm, but wait, let me check with a smaller example to see if my method is correct. Suppose I wanted to find the number of x-intercepts in (0.1, 0.2). Then, x=1/(n\u03c0), so 0.1 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.2. Taking reciprocals: 5 < n\u03c0 < 10, so n must satisfy 5/\u03c0 < n < 10/\u03c0. Calculating 5/\u03c0\u22481.5915, 10/\u03c0\u22483.1831. So n can be 2,3. So, n=2: x=1/(2\u03c0)\u22480.159, which is in (0.1,0.2). n=3: x=1/(3\u03c0)\u22480.106, which is in (0.1,0.2). So, two intercepts. Using my formula: lower bound n=2, upper bound n=3. Number of integers=3-2+1=2, which is correct. So, my method seems to work. Therefore, applying it to the original problem, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) has x-intercepts where \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\), which occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for integer \\( n \\).

So, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000, and since 1/x = n\u03c0, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n must be between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0.

But wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the range of n. Let me double-check the inequalities. Starting with x = 1/(n\u03c0) in (0.0001, 0.001). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and remembering that taking reciprocals reverses the inequalities because all terms are positive): 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing all parts by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating those: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098, which confirms my earlier result. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, 2865 x-intercepts. I think that's correct. Wait, but just to be thorough, let me check with specific values. For n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.14) \u2248 0.0009968, which is approximately 0.0009968, which is greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. Similarly, for n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, but wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but since it's 1/(3183\u03c0), let me compute it more accurately. 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000.0 (since 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000.0). So, x \u2248 1/10000 = 0.0001, but our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.0001, so x = 0.0001 is not included. Therefore, n = 3183 would give x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is just at the lower bound, but since the interval is open, we exclude it. Wait, but earlier I thought n goes up to 3183. But if 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, which is the lower bound, which is excluded, so perhaps n should go up to 3182? Wait, that's a problem. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at both ends. So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, when n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001, so that's okay. Now, for n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is equal to the lower bound, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so x = 0.0001 is excluded. Therefore, n must be such that x > 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than 3183.098, meaning the maximum integer n is 3183, but wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is equal to the lower bound, so to ensure x > 0.0001, we need n < 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001 when n = 3183.098, but since n must be integer, n = 3183 gives x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but since the interval is open, we must exclude x = 0.0001. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but we have to check whether 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001 or not. Wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) = 1/(10000.0) exactly? Because 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. So, if n = 3183, x = 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) would be slightly larger than 0.0001, so x would be greater than 0.0001. So, let me recalculate the range. So, n must satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which is n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n can be up to 3183, but when n = 3183, x = 0.0001, which is excluded. So, the maximum n is 3182. Similarly, for the lower end, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so the smallest n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Now, let's compute the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive. The formula is (last - first) + 1. So, 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, there are 2864 x-intercepts. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, I must have made a mistake earlier by including n = 3183, which gives x = 0.0001, which is excluded. So, the correct number is 2864.\n\nWait, let me confirm this again. So, n must be greater than 318.309, so n starts at 319. n must be less than 3183.098, so n can go up to 3183, but since 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10000, 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded. So, n can be up to 3182. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, 2864 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n can go up to 3183, but that gives x = 0.0001, which is excluded, so n must stop at 3182. So, the correct count is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded. So, n goes up to 3182, which gives x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 slightly more than 0.0001, so included.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but let me compute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863, then add 1: 2864. Yes.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought n goes up to 3183, I got 2865, but that was incorrect because n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. So, the correct number is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with specific n values. Let me take n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22481/(1003.14)\u22480.0009968, which is within (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22481/(10000 - \u03c0)\u22481/(9996.86)\u22480.00010003, which is just above 0.0001, so included. And n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0)=1/(10000.00)\u22480.0001, which is excluded.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865, but since n=3183 is excluded, it's 2864.\n\nWait, but let me think again: the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, from 319 to 3182 inclusive, it's 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check once more: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the final answer is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n.

The number of integers in this range is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\n\\boxed{2864}"

So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and remembering that flipping the inequality when taking reciprocals because all terms are positive), we get: 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing all parts by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098.

Let me check: 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, but actually, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 3183*3.1416 \u2248 10000.0 (since 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098). So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.0, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, x cannot be exactly 0.0001.

Let me verify if my approach is correct. Alternatively, I can think of n starting at 319 and going up to 3183. The number of terms in this sequence is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, that seems consistent. Wait a second, but let me think about whether n can actually be as high as 3183. Because x = 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001. So, when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183*3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001. But the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001, not equal. So, n must be less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but x would be 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100003, which is just slightly above 0.0001. So, it's included in the interval. Similarly, n starts at 319, giving x \u2248 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000984, which is less than 0.001. So, that's also included. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.

So, there are 2865 integer values of n from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the bounds. Let me plug in n = 319 into x = 1/(n\u03c0): x \u2248 1/(319 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/1003.08 \u2248 0.000997. Is that greater than 0.0001? Yes, because 0.000997 > 0.0001. And for n = 3183: x \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/10000.0008 \u2248 0.0000999992, which is just less than 0.0001. Wait, that's actually less than 0.0001. So, x \u2248 0.0000999992 is less than 0.0001, which is 0.0001. So, does that mean that n = 3183 gives x just below 0.0001, which is outside the interval? Therefore, the upper bound for n should be such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. So, let me re-examine the inequality. We have x = 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, so n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than 3183.098, meaning the maximum integer n is 3183. But when n = 3183, x \u2248 0.0000999992, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. So, actually, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but x at n=3183 is just below 0.0001, so it's not in the interval. Therefore, the maximum n should be such that x > 0.0001, which would be n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0). So, n can be up to floor(1/(0.0001\u03c0)) - 1? Wait, no, let me think again. The inequality is 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, so n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, the maximum integer n is 3183, but when n=3183, x \u2248 0.0000999992 < 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the maximum n should be 3182. Let me check n=3182: x \u2248 1/(3182 * \u03c0) \u2248 1/(10022.3) \u2248 0.00009977, which is still less than 0.0001. Hmm, that's not correct. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 1/(3183 * \u03c0): 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.1416 \u2248 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, 3183 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0928. Adding those together: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.0928 \u2248 450.7128. So total is 9549 + 450.7128 \u2248 9999.7128. So, 1/9999.7128 \u2248 0.0001000028, which is just over 0.0001. So, x \u2248 0.0001000028, which is greater than 0.0001, so n=3183 gives x \u2248 0.0001000028, which is in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, so earlier I thought it was less, but actually, it's just over 0.0001. So, n=3183 is included. Then, n=3184: x \u2248 1/(3184 * \u03c0) \u2248 1/(3184 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(10025.6) \u2248 0.00009974, which is less than 0.0001, so n=3184 is excluded. So, the maximum n is 3183, and the minimum n is 319. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me calculate that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, 2865 x-intercepts. Wait, but let me check n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.08) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. And n=319 gives x\u22480.000997, which is between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, that's correct. So, the total number is 2865.

So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But wait, let me think again. Is each n corresponding to a unique x in the interval? Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), and n increases, x decreases. So as n increases from 319 to 3183, x decreases from 1/(319\u03c0) to 1/(3183\u03c0). Let me check if 1/(319\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001 and 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.001. Let's compute 1/(319\u03c0): 1/(319 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(1002.7) \u2248 0.000997, which is approximately 0.001, but wait, 0.000997 is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Wait, but 0.000997 is actually greater than 0.0001, so 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000997 is within (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) \u2248 0.0001, but let me compute more accurately. 3183\u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, which is the lower bound. But since the interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), we don't include the endpoints. So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, does 1/(319\u03c0) equal exactly 0.0001? Let me check: 1/(0.0001) = 10000, so 10000 = n\u03c0, so n = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n = 3183 gives x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so n must be less than 3183.098. So, n can be up to 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the largest n is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) would be slightly larger than 0.0001. Wait, no, let me think again. If n = 3183, then x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound. Since the interval is open, we don't include x = 0.0001, so n can't be 3183. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. Similarly, the minimum n is 319 because n = 318 gives x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.001, which is the upper bound, but again, the interval is open, so we don't include x = 0.001. So, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Now, let's calculate the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive. The formula is (last - first) + 1. So, (3182 - 319) + 1. Let's compute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863. Then add 1: 2863 + 1 = 2864. Wait, so earlier I thought it was 2865, but now it's 2864. Hmm, where did I go wrong? Let me check: n starts at 319 and ends at 3182. The number of terms is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863. Then add 1: 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, the correct number is 2864. Therefore, there are 2864 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Let me just double-check this. So, n must satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n \u2264 3183. But since 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, and the interval is open, n must be less than 3183.098, so n \u2264 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is not included, so n must be \u2264 3182. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n \u2265 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Number of terms: 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. So, yes, 2864 is the correct count. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at 1/x = n\u03c0 for integers n. Solving for x gives x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving these inequalities gives n between approximately 318.309 and 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n ranges from 319 to 3182. The number of integers in this range is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\n$\\boxed{2864}$"

I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning, so I think 2865 is the correct number.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer n. To find the number of intercepts in (0.0001, 0.001), we determine the range of n:\n\n1. 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n2. Solving for n gives 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183.\n3. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"
