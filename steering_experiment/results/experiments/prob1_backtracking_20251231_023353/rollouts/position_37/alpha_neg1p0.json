Therefore, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Each of these n corresponds to an x-intercept in the given interval. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the range of n. Let me check the calculations again. Starting with 0.0001 < x < 0.001, and x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and remembering that flipping inequalities when taking reciprocals because all terms are positive), we get 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Then, dividing each part by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 is 2865. So, yes, 2865 x-intercepts. Hmm, that seems like a lot, but given that as x approaches 0, the function oscillates more and more rapidly, so between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a small interval near zero, there are indeed many oscillations, leading to many zeros. So, I think the answer is 2865. Wait, but let me check the exact bounds. When n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.14) \u2248 0.0009978, which is just below 0.001, so it's included.

Therefore, there are 2865 integer values of n, which correspond to 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check. Sometimes when dealing with inequalities, it's easy to make a mistake with the direction. Let me confirm that when x is in (0.0001, 0.001), 1/x is in (1000, 10000). So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. So, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing through by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.

Let me compute 1/(0.0001\u03c0) again. 0.0001 is 1e-4, so 1/(1e-4 * \u03c0) = 1/(\u03c0 * 1e-4) = 1e4 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.098.

Let me recalculate the bounds for n. Starting with x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and remembering to reverse the inequalities since reciprocating positive numbers reverses the inequality order): 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. That is, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.

So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me think if there's any possibility that n could be 0 or negative. Well, x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which are positive numbers, so 1/x is positive, and sin(1/x) is zero when 1/x = n\u03c0 where n is a positive integer. So, n starts at 1, but in our case, n starts at 319 because 1/(319\u03c0) is approximately 0.000995, which is just below 0.001, and 1/(318\u03c0) is approximately 0.001005, which is just above 0.001, so n=318 would give x \u2248 0.001005, which is outside the upper bound of 0.001, so n starts at 319. Similarly, n=3183 gives x \u2248 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999, which is just above 0.0001, and n=3184 would give x \u2248 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000998, which is just below 0.0001, so n=3183 is the last valid n.

So, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. Therefore, sin(1/x) will have zeros where 1/x = n\u03c0, so n = 1/(x\u03c0).

So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct. So, I think the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me think again. When x approaches 0, 1/x approaches infinity, so the function oscillates infinitely many times. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a finite interval, the function will oscillate finitely many times. Each time 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0, we get an x-intercept. So, the number of intercepts should be the number of times 1/x crosses n\u03c0 as x moves from 0.001 to 0.0001, which is equivalent to n going from 319 to 3183. So, yes, 2865 intercepts.

Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. Let me double-check the bounds. 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001, so n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, the maximum integer n is 3183. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309, so the minimum integer n is 319. So, n runs from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of terms in this sequence is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, yes, 2865 x-intercepts. Hmm, but wait a second. Let me think again. The function sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches zero, but in this case, the interval is from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is a finite interval, albeit very close to zero. Each time x passes through 1/(n\u03c0), the function crosses zero. So, each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept in the interval. So, the number of x-intercepts should be the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001). Which is exactly what I calculated. So, 2865 seems correct. But let me check with an example. Let's take n=319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.53) \u2248 0.0009964, which is less than 0.001 and greater than 0.0001. Similarly, n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.03) \u2248 0.000099999, which is just above 0.0001. So, both ends are included, so n=319 gives x\u22480.0009964, which is within (0.0001, 0.001), and n=3183 gives x\u22480.000099999, which is just above 0.0001. So, yes, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive give x in the interval. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.

Hmm, but wait a second, let me confirm if n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 +1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the range of n. Let me double-check the substitution. We have x = 1/(n\u03c0), and x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let's solve for n:\n\nStarting with 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0):\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0: 0.0001 * n\u03c0 < 1\n\nThen, n < 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618\n\nSimilarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001:\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0\n\nThen, n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098862\n\nSo, n must be greater than approximately 318.309 and less than approximately 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319, and the largest is 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check with specific examples. Let's take n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.30) \u2248 0.0009967, which is less than 0.001 and greater than 0.0001. Similarly, n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, we need to check if 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Let's compute 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) = 0.0001. But 0.0001 is the lower bound, which is excluded in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, we need to ensure that x=1/(n\u03c0) is strictly greater than 0.0001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n can be up to 3183, because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.0, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since it's equal to 0.0001, which is the lower bound, and the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.0001, we need to exclude n=3183 because x=1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001 exactly, which is not in the interval. Therefore, the upper limit for n is 3182, not 3183. Wait, that changes things. Let me re-examine this.\n\nSo, if x must be greater than 0.0001, then 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n must be an integer, the maximum n is 3183, but wait, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.0, so 1/(3183\u03c0) = 0.0001 exactly. But since x must be greater than 0.0001, n cannot be 3183 because that would give x=0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9999.9972, so 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000001, which is just above 0.0001. So, n can go up to 3182. Similarly, for the lower bound, n must be greater than 318.3098862, so the smallest integer n is 319.\n\nSo, now, the range of n is from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that:\n\n3182 - 319 = 2863\n\n2863 + 1 = 2864\n\nSo, there are 2864 integer values of n from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which means 2864 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n went up to 3183, but now I'm seeing that n=3183 gives x=0.0001 exactly, which is excluded, so n must go up to 3182. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0). Let's compute 3182\u03c0: \u03c0\u22483.1415926535, so 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 3000\u03c0\u22489424.77796, 182\u03c0\u2248571.9958, so total \u22489424.77796 + 571.9958 \u2248 9996.77376. So, 1/(9996.77376) \u22480.000100032, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n=3182 is valid.\n\nSimilarly, n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u22481/(1003.30)\u22480.0009967, which is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nNow, let's check n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22481/(10000.0)=0.0001, which is exactly the lower bound, so it's excluded.\n\nSo, the number of n's is from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, how many integers is that? It's 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but now I'm getting 2864. Let me make sure about the calculation.\n\n3182 - 319 = 2863\n\n2863 +1 = 2864\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. When we have a range from a to b inclusive, the number of integers is b - a +1. So, here a=319, b=3182. So, 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check with smaller numbers to make sure. Suppose I have n from 2 to 5 inclusive. The numbers are 2,3,4,5. So, 5-2+1=4 numbers, which is correct. So, same here, 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought 3183 was included, but since it's excluded, it's 2864.\n\nSo, the final answer is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a miscalculation in the number of terms. Let me compute 3182 -319=2863, then +1=2864.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as starting from n=1, up to n=3182, and subtracting the numbers before 319.\n\nBut that's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the floor and ceiling functions.\n\nSo, the lower bound for n is n > 1000/\u03c0\u2248318.309, so n_min=319.\n\nThe upper bound is n < 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.098, so n_max=3183, but since x must be >0.0001, n must be <3183.098, so n_max=3183 is excluded, so n_max=3182.\n\nTherefore, number of terms is 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009967, which is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nn=3182: x\u22480.000100032, which is just above 0.0001, so included.\n\nn=3183: x\u22480.0001, excluded.\n\nSo, the count is from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 2864 numbers.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. To find the intercepts in (0.0001, 0.001), we determine the range of n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n gives n between approximately 318.31 and 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n ranges from 319 to 3182, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\n$\\boxed{2864}$"

Therefore, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Each of these n corresponds to an x-intercept in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recalculate the bounds for n. Starting with x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Then, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. Because 1/0.001 = 1000 and 1/0.0001 = 10000. So, 1/x is in (1000, 10000). Since 1/x = n\u03c0, then n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000. So, n is between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0. Calculating those: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. Now, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, that seems correct. Wait, but let me think again: if n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, then the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Alternatively, it's the same as (3183 - 318) - (319 - 318) + 1? Hmm, maybe another way to think about it is to subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add 1. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, and 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me check if n=3183 is included. Since 3183\u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's see, 3000*3.1416=9424.8, 183*3.1416\u2248574.9, so total \u22489424.8 + 574.9\u224810,000. So, 3183\u03c0\u224810,000, which is the upper bound of 1/x. So, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, but the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.0001, so x=1/(3183\u03c0) would be exactly 0.0001, but since the interval is open, that point is excluded. Wait, that's a problem. So, my earlier assumption that n goes up to 3183 is incorrect because x=1/(3183\u03c0) would be at the lower end of the interval, which is excluded. So, actually, n should be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is not included in the interval. Therefore, the maximum n should be 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) would be slightly greater than 0.0001, which is within the interval. Wait, let me compute 1/(3182\u03c0). 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's compute 3000*3.1416=9424.8, 182*3.1416\u2248572.0, so total \u22489424.8 + 572.0\u224810,000. So, 3182\u03c0\u22489997. So, 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22481/9997\u22480.00010003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, 3183\u03c0\u224810,000.01, so 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00009999, which is just below 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, n can go up to 3182. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, not 3183. So, that changes the count. So, now n starts at 319 and goes up to 3182. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but let me confirm this. So, n starts at 319, and ends at 3182. So, the number of terms is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863. Then, 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, that's correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought n went up to 3183, but now I see that n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, making the total number of x-intercepts 2864. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the subtraction. 3182 - 319: Let's break it down. 3182 - 300 = 2882, then 2882 - 19 = 2863. Then, adding 1 gives 2864. Yes, that's correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the number of integers between a and b is floor(b) - ceil(a) + 1. So, in this case, a=318.309, b=3183.098. So, ceil(a)=319, floor(b)=3183. Then, number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. But wait, earlier I saw that n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, floor(b) should be 3182, not 3183. So, perhaps the formula is floor(b) - ceil(a) + 1. So, floor(3183.098)=3183, but since 3183\u03c0 is just over 10,000, which would make x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00009999, which is less than 0.0001. So, actually, the maximum n is 3182, because 3182\u03c0\u22489997, so 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.00010003, which is just above 0.0001, included in the interval. Therefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. So, I think the correct count is 2864. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first calculated, I thought the upper limit was 3183.098, so floor(b)=3183, but in reality, 3183\u03c0 is just over 10,000, making x=1/(3183\u03c0) just under 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). \n\nTo find x in (0.0001, 0.001), we solve:\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\u2192 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\u2192 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098\n\nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3182 (since 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000.01, making x \u2248 0.00009999, which is excluded). \n\nThe number of integers from 319 to 3182 is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}."

And x must be less than 0.001, which corresponds to n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309, so n starts at 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183.

Each n corresponds to a unique x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when dealing with inequalities, especially when substituting, it's easy to make a mistake. So, starting again, the x-intercepts are at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer n. We have 0.0001 < x < 0.001, so substituting, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and remembering that reversing inequalities when taking reciprocals because all terms are positive), we get 10000 > n\u03c0 > 1000. Dividing through by \u03c0, we get 10000/\u03c0 > n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098 and 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 gives 2865. So, yes, 2865 x-intercepts. Wait, but let me think about whether the endpoints are included. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. Therefore, the corresponding n values would be such that 1/(n\u03c0) is strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. So, n must be strictly less than 10000/\u03c0 and strictly greater than 1000/\u03c0. Therefore, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098. Since n is an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, as before. So, the count remains 2865.

We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n gives 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

Therefore, there are 2865 integer values of n, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of terms in this sequence is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2865. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of it as starting from n=1, up to n=3183, which is 3183 numbers, and then subtracting the numbers from n=1 to n=318, which is 318 numbers. So, 3183 - 318 = 2865. Yes, that also gives 2865. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me make sure that all these x-values are indeed within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). The smallest x is when n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.98) \u2248 0.000997, which is just below 0.001, so that's within the interval. The largest x is when n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.00) \u2248 0.0001, which is just above 0.0001, so that's also within the interval. So, all these x-intercepts are indeed within the given interval. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but I just realized, when n increases, x decreases, right? So, the first x-intercept is at x=1/(319\u03c0), which is approximately 0.000997, and the last one is at x=1/(3183\u03c0), which is approximately 0.0000997, but wait, 0.0000997 is less than 0.0001, so that would be outside the interval. Hmm, that seems contradictory. Wait, I thought earlier that 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but let me compute that more accurately.\n\nLet me calculate 1/(3183 * \u03c0). \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let me compute 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, and 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 574.45626, so total is approximately 9424.77796 + 574.45626 \u2248 10,000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But wait, 3183\u03c0 is exactly 10,000? Let me check that. 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let me compute 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, 3183 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 approximately 5.065. Adding those together: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.065 \u2248 450.685. So total is 9549 + 450.685 \u2248 9999.685. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.685, which is just under 10,000. Therefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.685 \u2248 0.000100003, which is just over 0.0001. So, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.98) \u2248 0.000997, which is just below 0.001, so it's also within the interval. So, both endpoints are included, so n=319 to n=3183 are all valid. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check if n=3183 is included. Since x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.000997, which is just below 0.001, so it's included. So, both ends are included, so the count is correct at 2865.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the number of zeros of sin(1/x) between x=0.0001 and x=0.001. Each zero occurs at x=1/(n\u03c0), so we can find the range of n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n, we get 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0). Calculating those, 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309, and 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1, so 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that's consistent with what I found earlier.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. So, between 0.0001 and 0.001, it's oscillating a lot, but the number of zeros should be finite, which it is, as we found 2865. That seems reasonable.\n\nLet me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the range of n. So, x must be greater than 0.0001, so 1/x < 10000. Similarly, x must be less than 0.001, so 1/x > 1000. Therefore, 1000 < 1/x < 10000. Since sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000. Therefore, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so dividing by \u03c0, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, which gives 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the number of zeros as the number of times the argument of the sine function, which is 1/x, passes through multiples of \u03c0 as x moves from 0.001 down to 0.0001. So, the change in 1/x is from 1000 to 10000, so the total change is 9000. The distance between each zero is \u03c0, so the number of zeros is approximately the total change divided by \u03c0, which is 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866. But wait, that's approximately 2866, but our exact count was 2865. Hmm, that's very close. The difference is because the endpoints might not both be zeros, or because we're dealing with integer counts. So, perhaps the exact count is 2865, and the approximation is 2866, but since we're counting exact integers, it's 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check that. The total change in 1/x is from 1000 to 10000, so that's 9000. The number of zeros would be the number of times 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0 in that interval. So, starting at 1000, the next zero is at the next multiple of \u03c0 above 1000, which is n\u03c0 where n is the smallest integer greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, which is 319\u03c0 \u2248 1002.98. Then, each subsequent zero is \u03c0 apart. So, the number of zeros is the number of multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000, inclusive. So, the number of terms in the sequence 319\u03c0, 320\u03c0, ..., 3183\u03c0. The number of terms is (3183 - 319) + 1 = 2865, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the number of zeros is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0) + 1. Let's compute that. floor(10000/\u03c0) \u2248 floor(3183.098) = 3183. ceil(1000/\u03c0) \u2248 ceil(318.309) = 319. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that's another way to get the same result.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at 1/x = n\u03c0 for integers n. Solving for x gives x = 1/(n\u03c0). To find the number of such x in (0.0001, 0.001), we determine the range of n:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001  \n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000  \n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098\n\nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

So, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. Now, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so 1/x must be an integer multiple of \u03c0. So, n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000.

I found that n must be between approximately 318.309 and 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of terms in this sequence is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. That seems correct. Alternatively, sometimes when counting integers between two numbers, it's easy to make a mistake, so let me think differently. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, a = 319, b = 3183. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Yep, that's correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but I should check if 1/(319\u03c0) is indeed greater than 0.0001 and 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.001. Let me compute 1/(319\u03c0): 1/(319 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(1002.69) \u2248 0.000997, which is approximately 0.001, but wait, that's more than 0.0001, but wait, 0.000997 is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Wait, but 1/(319\u03c0) is approximately 0.000997, which is just below 0.001, so it's included. Similarly, 1/(3183\u03c0): 1/(3183 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000.00008) \u2248 0.000099999, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. So, n=319 gives x\u22480.000997, which is in (0.0001, 0.001), and n=3183 gives x\u22480.000099999, which is just above 0.0001. So, both endpoints are included, which means n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, giving 2865 intercepts. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because 1/(n\u03c0) is decreasing as n increases, right? So, as n increases, x decreases. So, when n=319, x\u22480.000997, which is near the upper end of the interval (0.001), and when n=3183, x\u22480.000099999, which is near the lower end (0.0001). So, the intercepts occur as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001, with each n corresponding to a point where sin(1/x) crosses zero. So, each time n increases by 1, x decreases by a small amount, approaching zero. So, the number of zeros is indeed the number of integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive, which is 2865. Therefore, the answer should be 2865. Wait, but let me check if I've considered all possible n. For example, is n=318 included? Let's see: n=318: x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22481/(1000.03)\u22480.00099997, which is just below 0.001, so it's within the interval. Wait, but earlier I thought n starts at 319, but n=318 gives x\u22480.00099997, which is still less than 0.001, so it's in the interval. So, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let's recalculate the inequalities. Starting again: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, solving for n: 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0). Calculating 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248318.309, and 1/(0.0001\u03c0)=10000/\u03c0\u22483183.098. So, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but earlier I thought n=318 gives x\u22480.00099997, which is still in the interval. So, does n=318 count? Let me check: 1/(318\u03c0) \u22480.00099997, which is less than 0.001, so it's in (0.0001, 0.001). But according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=319 is the first integer. So, n=318 would give x\u22480.00099997, which is less than 0.001, but is it greater than 0.0001? Yes, it's 0.00099997, which is greater than 0.0001. Wait, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=319 is the first integer. So, n=318 is less than 318.309, so it doesn't satisfy n > 318.309. Therefore, n=318 is not included. So, n starts at 319. Therefore, the number of integers is from 319 to 3183, which is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that's correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). To find the number of such x in (0.0001, 0.001), we solve:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nThis gives:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nApproximating:\n\n318.309 < n < 3183.098\n\nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive.

Hmm, but wait a second, let me double-check if both 319 and 3183 are included. When n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, the count is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me verify with a smaller example: if n ranges from 2 to 5, inclusive, that's 5 - 2 + 1 = 4 numbers: 2,3,4,5. So, yes, that formula works. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865.

Therefore, there are 2865 integer values of n, each corresponding to an x-intercept in the given interval. Wait, but let me double-check if I did the inequalities correctly. I had 0.0001 < x < 0.001, and x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and remembering that flipping inequalities when taking reciprocals since all terms are positive): 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.

Therefore, there are 2865 integer values of n, each corresponding to an x-intercept in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the bounds. When x = 0.0001, 1/x = 10000, and when x = 0.001, 1/x = 1000. So, \u03b8 = 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000 radians. Since sin(\u03b8) = 0 at \u03b8 = n\u03c0, the zeros occur at \u03b8 = \u03c0, 2\u03c0, 3\u03c0, ..., up to the maximum \u03b8 in the interval. So, the first zero after \u03b8 = 1000 is at n\u03c0 where n is the smallest integer such that n\u03c0 \u2265 1000. Let me calculate n_min: n_min = ceil(1000 / \u03c0) \u2248 ceil(318.309) = 319. Similarly, the last zero before \u03b8 = 10000 is at n\u03c0 where n is the largest integer such that n\u03c0 \u2264 10000. So, n_max = floor(10000 / \u03c0) \u2248 floor(3183.098) = 3183. So, the number of zeros is n_max - n_min + 1 = 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of the number of zeros as the number of times the sine function completes a full cycle between \u03b8 = 1000 and \u03b8 = 10000. Each full cycle has one zero crossing at each multiple of \u03c0. So, the number of zero crossings is the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000, inclusive. So, the count is floor(10000 / \u03c0) - ceil(1000 / \u03c0) + 1 = 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.

Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. Starting again: 0.0001 < x < 0.001, and x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let's solve for n in each part. First part: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Multiply both sides by n\u03c0: 0.0001n\u03c0 < 1. Then, n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183. Second part: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Multiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001n\u03c0. Then, n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309, so the minimum integer n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check with specific values.

Therefore, the total number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's the answer. But wait, another way to think about it: The function sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. Between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a very small interval near zero, the function oscillates infinitely many times, but since our interval is bounded, we can count the number of zeros by considering how many times 1/x crosses multiples of \u03c0.
