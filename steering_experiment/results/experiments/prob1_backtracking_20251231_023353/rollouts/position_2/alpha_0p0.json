    "text": " \n\nLet me start by recalling that sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 is an integer multiple of \u03c0. So, for sin(1/x) to be zero, 1/x must be equal to n\u03c0, where n is an integer. That means x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n.\n\nNow, I need to find all such x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, I can set up inequalities:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nI can solve these inequalities for n to find the range of integers n that satisfy this condition.\n\nFirst, let me rewrite the inequalities:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nSince n is positive (because x is positive in the interval we're considering), I can take reciprocals on both sides without flipping the inequalities. Wait, no, actually, when I take reciprocals, the inequalities reverse because taking reciprocals of positive numbers reverses the order. So, let me be careful here.\n\nStarting with 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001:\n\nTaking reciprocals, we get n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Let me compute 1/0.0001. 0.0001 is 10^{-4}, so 1/10^{-4} is 10^4, which is 10000. So, n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nSimilarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001:\n\nTaking reciprocals, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001. 0.001 is 10^{-3}, so 1/10^{-3} is 10^3, which is 1000. So, n\u03c0 > 1000.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDivide all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nNow, let me compute these values.\n\nFirst, 1000 divided by \u03c0. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184.\n\nSimilarly, 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184.\n\nSince n must be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319, and the largest possible n is 3183.\n\nNow, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nTo find the number of integers between a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1.\n\nSo, plugging in the values: 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\nThen, 2864 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, 1000 / \u03c0 is approximately 318.309886184, so the next integer is 319.\n\nSimilarly, 10000 / \u03c0 is approximately 3183.09886184, so the integer part is 3183.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating 3183 - 319:\n\n3183 - 300 = 2883\n\n2883 - 19 = 2864\n\nSo, 2864 + 1 = 2865.\n\nTherefore, there are 2865 integer values of n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but let me make sure that each of these x values is indeed in the interval. Since we derived the inequalities correctly, and n ranges from 319 to 3183, each x = 1/(n\u03c0) will satisfy 0.0001 < x < 0.001.\n\nJust to check with a few examples:\n\nFor n = 319:\n\nx = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.09886184) \u2248 0.00099695, which is approximately 0.000997, which is less than 0.001 and greater than 0.0001, so it's in the interval.\n\nFor n = 3183:\n\nx = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.09886184) \u2248 0.000099999, which is approximately 0.0001, but slightly less. Wait, but 0.0001 is 10^{-4}, so 0.000099999 is just below 0.0001, so it's not in the interval. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, so maybe my upper bound is exclusive. Let me check:\n\nWe had 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, so n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so n starts at 319.\n\nSimilarly, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, so n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so n can be up to 3183 because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.09886184, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099999, which is just below 0.0001. So, actually, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is just less than 0.0001, which is outside our interval. So, the largest n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n = floor(10000/\u03c0) = 3183, but wait, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.09886184, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099999, which is less than 0.0001. So, actually, the largest n such that x > 0.0001 is n = floor(10000/\u03c0) - 1? Wait, no.\n\nWait, let me think. We have x = 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, so n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so the largest integer n is 3183. But as we saw, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099999 < 0.0001, so it's not in the interval. So, actually, we need n such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which is n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, the maximum integer n is 3183, but since 1/(3183\u03c0) < 0.0001, we need to exclude it. So, actually, n must be less than 3183.09886184, but since n must be integer, the maximum n is 3183, but we have to check if 1/(3183\u03c0) > 0.0001.\n\nWait, but 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 10000.09886184, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099999, which is less than 0.0001. Therefore, n cannot be 3183 because that would give x just below 0.0001, which is outside the interval. So, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nWait, let me check n = 3182:\n\nx = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000 - something). Let me compute 3182 * \u03c0:\n\n3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3182 * 3 = 9546, 3182 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3182 * 0.1416 \u2248 3182 * 0.1 = 318.2, 3182 * 0.0416 \u2248 132. So total \u2248 9546 + 318.2 + 132 \u2248 9546 + 450.2 \u2248 9996.2. So, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9996.2, so 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.2 \u2248 0.000100038, which is approximately 0.000100038, which is just above 0.0001, so it is in the interval.\n\nTherefore, n can go up to 3182. So, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nSimilarly, for n = 319, we saw that x \u2248 0.000997, which is just below 0.001, so it's in the interval.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n could go up to 3183, but actually, n=3183 gives x just below 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nSimilarly, let me check n = 319:\n\nx = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.09886184) \u2248 0.00099695, which is just below 0.001, so it's in the interval.\n\nSo, now, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n3182 - 319 = 2863\n\n2863 + 1 = 2864\n\nSo, there are 2864 integer values of n, which correspond to 2864 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but now it's 2864 because n goes up to 3182 instead of 3183.\n\nLet me double-check the calculation:\n\nFrom n = 319 to n = 3182 inclusive.\n\nNumber of terms = 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\n3182 - 319 = 2863\n\n2863 + 1 = 2864.\n\nYes, so 2864.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm with another approach.\n\nThe number of integers between a and b inclusive is floor(b) - ceil(a) + 1.\n\nIn this case, a = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so ceil(a) = 319.\n\nb = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so floor(b) = 3183.\n\nWait, but earlier we saw that n=3183 gives x just below 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, floor(b) is 3183, but we have to exclude it. So, perhaps the formula should be floor(b) - 1 - ceil(a) + 1 = floor(b) - ceil(a).\n\nWait, that might be complicating. Alternatively, since n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, but n must be integer, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so the maximum n is 3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x just below 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nSo, the number of integers is from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with specific numbers.\n\nLet me take a smaller example to see if the formula works.\n\nSuppose I have an interval where n must be greater than 2.3 and less than 5.7.\n\nSo, n must be 3,4,5.\n\nNumber of integers: 5 - 3 + 1 = 3.\n\nWhich is correct: 3,4,5.\n\nSimilarly, if n must be greater than 2.3 and less than 5.3, then n=3,4,5.\n\n5 - 3 +1=3.\n\nBut if n must be greater than 2.3 and less than 5.0, then n=3,4.\n\nSo, 4 - 3 +1=2.\n\nWait, so in our case, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184, so n starts at 319.\n\nn must be less than approximately 3183.09886184, but since n=3183 gives x just below 0.0001, which is excluded, so n must be less than or equal to 3182.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers is from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nSo, number of integers = 3182 - 319 +1.\n\nCalculating:\n\n3182 - 319 = 2863\n\n2863 +1=2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that each x=1/(n\u03c0) for n=319 to 3182 is indeed in (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nFor n=319:\n\nx=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.00099695, which is less than 0.001 and greater than 0.0001.\n\nFor n=3182:\n\nx=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.000100038, which is greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001.\n\nSo, both ends are included, so all n from 319 to 3182 inclusive give x in (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but after correcting for n=3183 being excluded, it's 2864.\n\nSo, the final answer is 2864.\n\nBut let me think again: when we have n starting at 319 and ending at 3182, the count is 3182 - 319 +1.\n\nYes, because when you subtract 319 from 3182, you get the number of steps between them, and then you add 1 to include both endpoints.\n\nSo, 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake earlier when I thought n goes up to 3183.09886184, but since n must be integer, n=3183 is excluded because x=1/(3183\u03c0) is just below 0.0001, which is outside the interval. Therefore, n must go up to 3182.\n\nThus, the correct count is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Maybe using the fact that between 0.0001 and 0.001, the function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. The number of zeros should correspond to how many times 1/x crosses multiples of \u03c0 as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001.\n\nSo, when x is 0.001, 1/x = 1000.\n\nWhen x is 0.0001, 1/x = 10000.\n\nSo, the function sin(1/x) will cross zero every time 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0, i.e., at 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n.\n\nSo, the number of zeros between x=0.0001 and x=0.001 is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nWhich is the same as n between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0.\n\nWhich is the same as n between approximately 318.309886184 and 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x just below 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182, inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the final answer is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe number of x-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\) is found by determining the integers \\( n \\) for which \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\) lies within the interval. This results in \\( n \\) ranging from 319 to 3182, inclusive, giving a total of 2864 intercepts.\n\n\\boxed{2864}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let me recall what the sine function looks like. The sine function has a period of 2\u03c0, right? So, it repeats every 2\u03c0 radians. It crosses zero at every integer multiple of \u03c0. So, sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 = n\u03c0, where n is an integer. \n\nIn this case, the function is sin(1/x), so I can set 1/x equal to n\u03c0 to find the x-intercepts. That gives me x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, each x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n. \n\nNow, the interval I'm looking at is (0.0001, 0.001). So, I need to find all integers n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me write that down:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nI can rewrite this inequality to solve for n. Let's take the reciprocals, remembering that taking reciprocals reverses the inequalities. But I have to be careful because all terms are positive here, so the direction of the inequalities will switch.\n\nFirst, take the left part: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Taking reciprocals, we get 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. So, 10000 > n\u03c0. Similarly, for the right part: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, taking reciprocals gives n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is n\u03c0 > 1000.\n\nSo now, we have:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDivide all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nCalculating those values:\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.31\n10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1416 \u2248 3183.09\n\nSince n must be an integer, n can take integer values from the next integer after 318.31 up to the integer just below 3183.09. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183.\n\nNow, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, actually, 319 is the first integer, and 3183 is the last. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nSo, there are 2865 integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) lies in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in that interval.\n\nWait a second, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. So, 1000/\u03c0 is approximately 318.31, so the next integer is 319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 is approximately 3183.09, so the largest integer less than that is 3183. So, from 319 to 3183 inclusive, the number of integers is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. \n\nCalculating that again: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct.\n\nI should also consider whether the endpoints are included. The interval given is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, meaning it doesn't include the endpoints. So, we don't have to worry about x = 0.0001 or x = 0.001 themselves. However, since 1/(n\u03c0) must be strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001, the values of n must satisfy n > 1000/\u03c0 and n < 10000/\u03c0. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, as I previously thought.\n\nJust to double-check, let's compute 1/(319\u03c0) and 1/(3183\u03c0) to ensure they fall within the interval.\n\n1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(319 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/1002.67 \u2248 0.000997, which is just under 0.001, so it's within the interval.\n\nSimilarly, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/10000.2 \u2248 0.0000999, which is just over 0.0001, so it's also within the interval.\n\nTherefore, both endpoints for n give x-values within the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, the count from 319 to 3183 inclusive is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is the number of zeros of sin(1/x) between x = 0.0001 and x = 0.001. Since each zero corresponds to a crossing from positive to negative or vice versa, the number of zeros is related to how many times the argument 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0 as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001.\n\nAs x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000. So, the argument of the sine function, which is 1/x, goes from 10000 down to 1000. The sine function crosses zero every \u03c0 units, so the number of crossings is approximately the difference between 10000 and 1000 divided by \u03c0.\n\nCalculating that: (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 \u2248 9000 / 3.1416 \u2248 2866.2. Hmm, but that's not an integer, and my previous count was 2865. So, why is there a slight discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps because I'm considering the exact number of integer multiples. Let me think again.\n\nThe number of zeros is equal to the number of times 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0 as x decreases from 0.0001 to 0.001. So, starting at x = 0.0001, 1/x = 10000, which is just after n\u03c0 where n = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09. So, the next zero after that would be at n = 3183, which is 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.2, which is just beyond 10000, so actually, the first zero in the interval would be at n = 3183, but since 3183\u03c0 is just over 10000, which corresponds to x just under 0.0001. But since our interval starts at x = 0.0001, which is 1/10000, we need to check if 3183\u03c0 is greater than 10000 or less.\n\nWait, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's compute that: 3000*3.1416=9424.8, 183*3.1416\u2248575.12, so total \u22489424.8 + 575.12\u224810,000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u224810,000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001. But since our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, x=0.0001 is excluded, so the first x-intercept would be at x=1/(3183\u03c0), which is approximately 0.0001, but just slightly larger, so it's included in the interval. Similarly, the last x-intercept is at x=1/(319\u03c0), which is approximately 0.000997, just under 0.001, so it's included as well.\n\nSo, the number of zeros is from n=319 to n=3183, which is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought about the approximate number of zeros as (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 \u2248 9000/3.1416\u22482866.2, which is approximately 2866. But my exact count is 2865. So, why the difference?\n\nAh, perhaps because when I subtract 319 from 3183, I get 2864, and then adding 1 gives 2865. But when I approximate (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0, I get 9000/\u03c0\u22482866.2, which is about 2866. So, the exact count is 2865, which is one less than the approximate value. That's probably because the endpoints don't both lie inside the interval. Since both 1/(3183\u03c0) and 1/(319\u03c0) are just inside the interval, maybe one of them is exactly at 0.0001 or 0.001, but since the interval is open, those exact points aren't included, so we might lose one count. But in reality, both 1/(3183\u03c0) and 1/(319\u03c0) are just inside the interval, so they both count, but perhaps the approximation counts an extra.\n\nWait, no, the exact count is 2865, so that's correct. The approximate method gives a close number but isn't exact.\n\nSo, to sum up, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe number of x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is determined by finding the integers n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n gives 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183, resulting in 2865 intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

    "text": " Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the sine function is zero at integer multiples of \u03c0. That is, sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 = n\u03c0, where n is any integer. So, in this case, \u03b8 is 1/x. Therefore, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0. Solving for x, that would mean x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, each x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n.\n\nNow, I need to find all such x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, I can set up inequalities:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nI can solve these inequalities for n to find the range of integers n that satisfy this condition. Let me start with the left inequality:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0)\n\nIf I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that flipping the inequality when taking reciprocals (since both sides are positive), I get:\n\n1/0.0001 > n\u03c0\n\nWhich is:\n\n10000 > n\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by \u03c0:\n\n10000/\u03c0 > n\n\nCalculating 10000 divided by \u03c0, since \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so:\n\n10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, n < approximately 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, the maximum possible n is 3183.\n\nNow, let's look at the right inequality:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nAgain, take reciprocals:\n\nn\u03c0 > 1/0.001\n\nWhich is:\n\nn\u03c0 > 1000\n\nDivide both sides by \u03c0:\n\nn > 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184\n\nSo, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184. Since n must be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers in this range, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add one (since both endpoints are included).\n\nNumber of intercepts = 3183 - 319 + 1\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\n2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nSo, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It's easy to mess up with such large numbers.\n\nStarting with n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098, so n starts at 319.\n\nn < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988, so n ends at 3183.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\n2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each n corresponds to a zero crossing. Since the function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more frequently as x approaches zero, the number of zeros in a small interval near zero can be very large.\n\nBut in this case, the interval is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is quite close to zero, but not extremely so. So, the number of oscillations, and hence zeros, is still quite large, which is why we get 2865 intercepts.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just visualize the function for a moment. As x approaches zero from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates wildly between -1 and 1. Each time 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0, the sine function crosses zero. So, each n corresponds to one crossing, and in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), we're capturing all those crossings where x is in that range.\n\nSo, I think my approach is correct, and the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

Now, I need to find all such x that lie within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Let me write that down: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. \n\nWait, so I can solve for n here. Let me rearrange the inequalities. Starting with the left part: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Taking reciprocals on both sides (and remembering that reversing the inequality when taking reciprocals), we get n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. \n\nCalculating 1/0.0001, that's 10000. So, n\u03c0 < 10000, which implies n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by that is roughly 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n is an integer, the maximum possible n here is 3183.\n\nNow, looking at the right part of the inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n > 1000 / \u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618. Since n is an integer, the smallest possible n here is 319.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. To find the number of integers from a to b inclusive, it's b - a + 1. So, plugging in the numbers: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that.\n\n3183 minus 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 3183.0988, so n must be less than that, so the largest integer n is 3183. Then, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 318.3098, so the smallest integer n is 319. Then, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. That seems correct.\n\nI should also consider whether the endpoints are included or not. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so we don't include the endpoints. But since x = 1/(n\u03c0), and n starts at 319, which gives x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.14) \u2248 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Similarly, the largest n is 3183, giving x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0001) \u2248 0.000099999, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. So, all the x-intercepts in that range are accounted for by n from 319 to 3183.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's the answer. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. So, 3183 minus 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Yep, that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. We need to find the number of such x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Solving for n, we find n ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 intercepts.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when dealing with reciprocals and inequalities, it's easy to make a mistake. \n\nStarting again, the x-intercepts are at x = 1/(n\u03c0). We want x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nLet me solve for n in each inequality:\n\nFor the lower bound: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) => n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001 => n\u03c0 < 10000 => n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618, so n \u2264 3183.\n\nFor the upper bound: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n\u03c0 > 1/0.001 => n\u03c0 > 1000 => n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098862, so n \u2265 319.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319:\n\n3183 - 300 = 2883\n\n2883 - 19 = 2864\n\nThen, 2864 + 1 = 2865.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. But let me think again: as x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is close to zero, the function oscillates a lot, crossing the x-axis many times. Each time n increases by 1, the intercept moves closer to zero. So, the number of intercepts should be proportional to the reciprocal of the interval length, but since we're dealing with specific bounds, the calculation as above should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the number of times 1/x passes through multiples of \u03c0 in the interval (1000, 10000). Because x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, so 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, the number of zeros is the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000.\n\nSo, the number of zeros is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0). Let me compute that:\n\n10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618, so floor of that is 3183.\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098862, so ceil of that is 319.\n\nSo, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nYes, same result. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: the distance from 1000 to 10000 is 9000. Each zero occurs approximately every \u03c0 units in 1/x. So, the number of zeros is roughly 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866. But since we're taking integer multiples, it's 2865. That seems consistent.\n\nWait, 9000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 2866.198, so the integer part would be 2866, but since we're starting just above 1000 and ending just below 10000, maybe it's 2865. Hmm, but my earlier calculation gives 2865, so perhaps that's accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the exact number is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0) + 1, which is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nYes, that seems correct.

So, the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer values of n.\n\nNow, I need to find all such x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, I can set up inequalities: 0.0001 < x < 0.001, and x = 1/(n\u03c0). Substituting, I get 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nLet me write that down: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. To find the range of n, I can take reciprocals on all parts, but I have to remember that taking reciprocals reverses the inequalities. So, let's see:\n\nStarting with 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Taking reciprocals gives 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0, which is 10000 > n\u03c0. Similarly, from 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, taking reciprocals gives n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is n\u03c0 > 1000.\n\nSo, putting it together: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. To find n, I can divide all parts by \u03c0. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nCalculating 1000/\u03c0: since \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, n must be an integer such that 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n can take values from 319 up to 3183.\n\nWait, let me check that. If 318.309886184 is the lower bound, then the next integer is 319.

So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nNow, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then add 1. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.\n\nThe number of integers from a to b inclusive is given by b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that.\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Let's take a smaller example to see if the formula works. Suppose I want the number of integers from 2 to 5 inclusive. That's 2,3,4,5 which is 4 numbers. Using the formula, 5 - 2 + 1 = 4, which is correct. So, yes, the formula works.\n\nSo, applying it here, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 integer values of n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial setup. The function is y = sin(1/x), and we're looking for x-intercepts in (0.0001, 0.001). So, each x-intercept is at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer n. So, yes, substituting x into the inequality, we get 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, leading to 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, and then 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the endpoints. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, not including the endpoints. So, x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. But when I set up the inequalities, I used strict inequalities, so 0.0001 < x < 0.001, which is correct. So, x must be strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. Therefore, the corresponding n must satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which is exactly what I did.\n\nWait, but let me check if n=318 gives x=1/(318\u03c0). Let me compute that. 318\u03c0 \u2248 318 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 1000.00000001. So, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009999999999, which is just under 0.001. So, x would be approximately 0.001, but since the interval is up to 0.001, not including it, n=318 would give x just below 0.001, so it's included. Wait, but earlier I had n starting at 319. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let's compute n=318: x=1/(318\u03c0). Since 318\u03c0 \u2248 1000, so x\u22480.001. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, does x=0.001 count? No, because it's not included. So, if x=1/(318\u03c0) is exactly 0.001, then it's not included. But in reality, 318\u03c0 is approximately 1000, but it's actually slightly more than 1000 because 318*3.1415926535 is exactly 1000.00000001... So, 1/(318\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.001, so x=1/(318\u03c0) is just under 0.001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=318 would give x\u22480.0009999999999, which is inside the interval. So, maybe my initial lower bound was incorrect.\n\nWait, let me recast the inequalities properly. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, solving for n:\n\n1/(0.001) < n\u03c0 < 1/(0.0001)\n\nWhich is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nCompute 1000/\u03c0: approximately 318.309886184\n\nCompute 10000/\u03c0: approximately 3183.09886184\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184.\n\nSince n must be an integer, the smallest integer greater than 318.309886184 is 319, and the largest integer less than 3183.09886184 is 3183.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nCompute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, 2883 - 19 = 2864\n\nThen, 2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nSo, there are 2865 integer values of n, which correspond to 2865 x-intercepts in the given interval.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that n=318 might give x just below 0.001, but according to this, n starts at 319. Let me check n=318:\n\nx = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.00000001) \u2248 0.0009999999999, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval. So, why did I set n starting at 319?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inequality direction. Let me double-check.\n\nFrom 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nTaking reciprocals, since all terms are positive, the inequalities reverse:\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nSo, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nThus, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nWait, but if n=318, then n\u03c0 \u2248 1000.00000001, which is greater than 1000, so 1/(n\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009999999999, which is less than 0.001, so x=1/(n\u03c0) is within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=318 should be included, right?\n\nWait, but 318 is less than 318.309886184, so according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309886184, so n=318 is less than that, so it's not included. Therefore, the first valid n is 319.\n\nWait, but let me compute 1/(318\u03c0). Let's be precise.\n\n318 * \u03c0 = 318 * 3.141592653589793 \u2248 318 * 3.141592653589793\n\nCompute 300*\u03c0 \u2248 942.477796077\n\n18*\u03c0 \u2248 56.5486677646\n\nAdding them together: 942.477796077 + 56.5486677646 \u2248 1000.02646384\n\nSo, 318\u03c0 \u2248 1000.02646384, so 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/1000.02646384 \u2248 0.000999973565.\n\nWhich is approximately 0.000999973565, which is less than 0.001, so x=0.000999973565 is within (0.0001, 0.001). So, n=318 gives x\u22480.000999973565, which is inside the interval. Therefore, n=318 should be included.\n\nWait, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184, so n=318 is less than that, so it's not included. Therefore, n=318 is not included, and the first n is 319.\n\nWait, but that contradicts the calculation where n=318 gives x\u22480.000999973565, which is within the interval. So, perhaps my initial approach was wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's consider x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, 0.0001 < x < 0.001.\n\nWe have x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nWhich implies 1/(0.001) < n\u03c0 < 1/(0.0001)\n\nWhich is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nThus, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nTherefore, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nSo, n=318 is less than 318.309886184, so it's not included. Therefore, n starts at 319.\n\nWait, but when I computed n=318, I got x\u22480.000999973565, which is less than 0.001, so it's inside the interval. So, why isn't n=318 included?\n\nWait, perhaps because 318\u03c0 is greater than 1000, so 1/(318\u03c0) is less than 0.001, but the inequality is 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which is 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001.\n\nSo, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n\u03c0 < 10000, which is already satisfied as n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nWait, but the lower bound is 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which implies n\u03c0 < 10000, which is true for all n up to 3183.09886184.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the inequalities. Let me write it again:\n\nWe have 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nSo, the left inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) implies that n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nThe right inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies that n\u03c0 > 1000.\n\nSo, combining both, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nThus, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, n=318 is excluded because 318 < 318.309886184, so n=318\u03c0 \u2248 1000.02646384, which is greater than 1000, so 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999973565, which is greater than 0.0001 (since 0.0001 is 0.0001, and 0.000999973565 is much larger than 0.0001). So, x=0.000999973565 is within (0.0001, 0.001), so n=318 should be included.\n\nWait, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309886184, so n=318 is less than that, so it's excluded. But the calculation shows that n=318 gives x within the interval. So, perhaps my initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's consider x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n1/(0.001) > n\u03c0 > 1/(0.0001)\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me think carefully.\n\nIf I have 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, then taking reciprocals (and remembering to reverse inequalities because all terms are positive):\n\n1/0.001 > n\u03c0 > 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is 1000 > n\u03c0 > 10000\n\nWait, that can't be right because 1000 > n\u03c0 > 10000 would imply 1000 > 10000, which is impossible. So, I must have made a mistake in taking reciprocals.\n\nWait, let me recall: if a < b < c and all are positive, then 1/a > 1/b > 1/c.\n\nSo, in this case, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nTaking reciprocals, we get:\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000.\n\nTherefore, n must be between 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nThus, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nSo, n=318 is excluded because 318 < 318.309886184, so n=318 would give n\u03c0 \u2248 1000.02646384, which is greater than 1000, so 1/(n\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999973565, which is within (0.0001, 0.001). So, why isn't n=318 included?\n\nWait, perhaps because n must satisfy n > 318.309886184, so n=318 is less than that, so it's excluded. Therefore, the first valid n is 319.\n\nWait, but 318\u03c0 \u2248 1000.02646384, which is greater than 1000, so 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999973565, which is less than 0.001, so x=0.000999973565 is within (0.0001, 0.001). So, why isn't n=318 included?\n\nWait, perhaps because 318\u03c0 \u2248 1000.02646384, which is greater than 1000, so 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999973565, which is less than 0.001, so x is within the interval. Therefore, n=318 should be included.\n\nWait, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309886184, so n=318 is less than that, so it's excluded. So, there's a contradiction here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inequality direction when taking reciprocals.\n\nLet me try again:\n\nGiven 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nSince all terms are positive, taking reciprocals will reverse the inequalities:\n\n1/0.001 > n\u03c0 > 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is 1000 > n\u03c0 > 10000.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 1000 > 10000 is false. So, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.\n\nIf I have a < b < c, then 1/a > 1/b > 1/c, provided all a, b, c are positive.\n\nSo, in this case, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nSo, taking reciprocals:\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, n\u03c0 must be greater than 1000 and less than 10000.\n\nSo, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nTherefore, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nSo, n=318 is less than 318.309886184, so it's excluded.\n\nBut when I compute n=318, I get x\u22480.000999973565, which is within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, why isn't n=318 included?\n\nWait, perhaps because n=318 gives n\u03c0 \u2248 1000.02646384, which is greater than 1000, so 1/(n\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999973565, which is less than 0.001, so x is within the interval. Therefore, n=318 should be included.\n\nWait, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309886184, so n=318 is less than that, so it's excluded. Therefore, n=318 is not included.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is arising because 318\u03c0 is just over 1000, so 1/(318\u03c0) is just under 0.001, which is within the interval. So, n=318 should be included, but according to the inequality, it's not. So, perhaps my initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that n must satisfy both 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nSo, let's solve each inequality separately.\n\nFirst, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001.\n\nThis implies that n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nSimilarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies that n\u03c0 > 1000.\n\nSo, combining both, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nThus, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nSo, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nTherefore, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nSo, n=318 is excluded because 318 < 318.309886184, so n=318\u03c0 \u2248 1000.02646384, which is greater than 1000, so 1/(n\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999973565, which is within (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=318 should be included, but according to the inequality, it's not.\n\nWait, perhaps the error is that 318\u03c0 \u2248 1000.02646384 is greater than 1000, so n=318 satisfies n\u03c0 > 1000, but n=318 is less than 318.309886184, so it doesn't satisfy n > 318.309886184. Therefore, n=318 is not included, but n=319 is included.\n\nWait, but n=318 gives x\u22480.000999973565, which is within the interval. So, why isn't n=318 included?\n\nWait, perhaps because n must be greater than 318.309886184, so n=318 is less than that, so it's excluded. Therefore, the first valid n is 319.\n\nWait, but then n=319 would give x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.753) \u2248 0.00099727, which is still within (0.0001, 0.001). So, n=319 is included.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the exact value of n where 1/(n\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001 and 0.001, to see the exact bounds.\n\nSo, 1/(n\u03c0) = 0.0001 implies n = 1/(0.0001 * \u03c0) \u2248 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nSimilarly, 1/(n\u03c0) = 0.001 implies n = 1/(0.001 * \u03c0) \u2248 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184.\n\nSo, to have 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, n must be less than 3183.09886184.\n\nTo have 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, n must be greater than 318.309886184.\n\nTherefore, n must be in (318.309886184, 3183.09886184).\n\nThus, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, n=318 is excluded, but n=319 is included.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that n=318 would give x\u22480.000999973565, which is within the interval, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309886184, so n=318 is excluded. Therefore, the first valid n is 319.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I just need to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive.\n\nSo, 3183 - 319 = 2864, then add 1 to include both endpoints, so 2865.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\). This occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for integer values of \\( n \\), which gives \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n\nWe need \\( x \\) to lie within the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\). Therefore, we set up the inequality:\n\\[ 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\]\n\nTaking reciprocals and reversing the inequalities, we get:\n\\[ 1000 < n\\pi < 10000 \\]\n\nDividing by \\( \\pi \\) (approximately 3.1415926535), we find:\n\\[ \\frac{1000}{\\pi} < n < \\frac{10000}{\\pi} \\]\n\\[ 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184 \\]\n\nThus, \\( n \\) must be an integer in the range from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers in this range is calculated as:\n\\[ 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts is \\(\\boxed{2865}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let me recall that sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 is an integer multiple of \u03c0. So, sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 = n\u03c0, where n is an integer. In this case, \u03b8 is 1/x, so I can set up the equation:\n\n1/x = n\u03c0\n\nSolving for x, I get:\n\nx = 1/(n\u03c0)\n\nSo, each x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n. Now, I need to find all such x that lie within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nLet me write down the inequalities:\n\n0.0001 < x < 0.001\n\nSubstituting x = 1/(n\u03c0) into this inequality:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nNow, I can solve for n. Let me take reciprocals, remembering that flipping the inequalities will reverse them because reciprocating positive numbers reverses the order.\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nCalculating 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nNow, dividing all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nLet me compute these values numerically. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535.\n\nCalculating 1000/\u03c0:\n\n1000 \u00f7 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184\n\nAnd 10000/\u03c0:\n\n10000 \u00f7 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184.\n\nSince n has to be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319, and the largest possible n is 3183.\n\nNow, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included).\n\nWait, let me check that. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So here, a is 319 and b is 3183. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\nThen, 2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nSo, there are 2865 integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. When I took the reciprocals, I correctly reversed the inequalities, right? Because 0.0001 < x < 0.001, so taking reciprocals, 1/0.001 < 1/x < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < 1/x < 10000, so 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which is correct.\n\nThen, dividing by \u03c0, I got 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so n must be from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nWait, let me confirm that 3183 is indeed less than 10000/\u03c0. Since 3183.09886184 is the upper limit, so 3183 is less than that, so n=3183 is included. Similarly, 319 is greater than 318.309886184, so n=319 is the first integer.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\n2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about the endpoints. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. So, the corresponding n would be when x approaches these limits. Let me check n=319:\n\nx = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(319*3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(1001.000...) So, x \u2248 0.000999001, which is just above 0.0001, so it's within the interval.\n\nSimilarly, n=3183:\n\nx = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183*3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000.000...) So, x \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so n=3183 would correspond to x=1/(3183\u03c0) which is approximately 0.000099999, which is less than 0.0001. Wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 1/(10000.000...), which is 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, x=0.0001 is excluded. So, does that mean n=3183 is not included?\n\nWait, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but is it exactly 0.0001? Let me compute 3183\u03c0:\n\n3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535\n\nLet me compute 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.1415926535.\n\nWell, 3183 * 0.1 is 318.3, 3183 * 0.0415926535 \u2248 let's see:\n\n0.0415926535 is approximately 0.0415926535.\n\n3183 * 0.04 = 127.32\n\n3183 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 approximately 5.084.\n\nSo, total \u2248 127.32 + 5.084 \u2248 132.404.\n\nSo, total 3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 318.3 + 132.404 \u2248 450.704.\n\nSo, total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9549 + 450.704 \u2248 9999.704.\n\nWait, so 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.704, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.704 \u2248 0.00010000296, which is just over 0.0001.\n\nWait, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010000296, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is just above 0.0001, so it is included in the interval.\n\nSimilarly, n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3184*3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10003.1415926535) \u2248 0.000099968, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded.\n\nWait, so n=3183 is included because x\u22480.00010000296 is just above 0.0001, so it's within the interval.\n\nSimilarly, n=319 gives x\u22481/(319\u03c0) \u22481/(1001.000...)\u22480.000999001, which is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nWait, but earlier when I calculated 10000/\u03c0, I got approximately 3183.09886184, so n must be less than that. So, n=3183 is allowed because 3183 < 3183.09886184, so n=3183 is included.\n\nWait, but when I computed 3183\u03c0, I got approximately 9999.704, which is just under 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is just over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval.\n\nSimilarly, n=3184 would give 1/(3184\u03c0) \u22481/(10003.1415926535)\u22480.000099968, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded.\n\nSo, the maximum n is 3183, which gives x\u22480.00010000296, which is included in the interval.\n\nSimilarly, the minimum n is 319, which gives x\u22480.000999001, which is within (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 +1.\n\nLet me compute that again:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\n2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nSo, there are 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did the calculation correctly. 3183 - 319 is indeed 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I initially thought about the interval, I thought maybe n=3183 would be excluded, but upon calculating, it's included because x is just over 0.0001.\n\nWait, let me confirm with n=3183:\n\nx = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u22481/(3183*3.1415926535) \u22481/9999.704\u22480.00010000296, which is indeed greater than 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nSimilarly, n=3184 would give x\u22481/(3184\u03c0)\u22481/10003.1415926535\u22480.000099968, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 2865 integers.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. The number of zeros of sin(1/x) between x=a and x=b is equal to the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is between a and b.\n\nSo, in this case, a=0.0001 and b=0.001.\n\nSo, the number of n's is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)).\n\nWait, let me see: 1/(a\u03c0) = 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u22483183.09886184\n\nSimilarly, 1/(b\u03c0) = 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248318.309886184\n\nSo, the number of integers n between 318.309886184 and 3183.09886184 is floor(3183.09886184) - ceil(318.309886184) + 1\n\nWait, that would be floor(3183.09886184)=3183\n\nceil(318.309886184)=319\n\nSo, 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I had before.\n\nWait, so that's another way to compute it, which also gives 2865.\n\nSo, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about it graphically. The function y=sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. Between x=0.0001 and x=0.001, it's oscillating very rapidly. Each oscillation has two zeros (except possibly at the endpoints). But in this case, since we're dealing with the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, we don't include the endpoints, but each full oscillation between two consecutive zeros would correspond to a change in n by 1.\n\nWait, but in reality, each zero corresponds to a specific n, so each x-intercept is at x=1/(n\u03c0), so each n gives exactly one x-intercept in the interval if x is within (0.0001, 0.001). So, the number of x-intercepts is exactly the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001), which is the same as n being in (1000/\u03c0, 10000/\u03c0), which we computed as 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 2865 intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me check if n=3183 is indeed the last one before x=0.0001. Since 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00010000296, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. The next one, n=3184, would be at x\u22480.000099968, which is below 0.0001, so excluded. So, n=3183 is the last included.\n\nSimilarly, the first n is 319, giving x\u22480.000999001, which is just below 0.001, so it's included. The previous n, n=318, would give x\u22481/(318\u03c0)\u22481/(1000.000...)=0.001, which is the upper bound, but since the interval is open, x=0.001 is excluded, so n=318 is excluded, and n=319 is the first included.\n\nWait, but hold on, 1/(318\u03c0) is exactly 1/(318*3.1415926535)=1/(1000.000...), so x=0.001, which is the upper limit, but since the interval is open, x=0.001 is not included. Therefore, n=318 would give x=0.001, which is excluded, so the first included n is 319, giving x\u22480.000999001, which is less than 0.001, so included.\n\nWait, but 1/(319\u03c0) is approximately 1/(1001.000...), which is approximately 0.000999001, which is less than 0.001, so included.\n\nWait, but 1/(318\u03c0) is exactly 1/(318*3.1415926535)=1/(1000.000...)=0.001, which is the upper limit, so excluded.\n\nSo, n starts at 319, giving x\u22480.000999001, which is just below 0.001, so included.\n\nSimilarly, n=3183 gives x\u22480.00010000296, which is just above 0.0001, so included.\n\nSo, the count from n=319 to n=3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 +1=2865.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another approach. The number of zeros is equal to the number of times the argument of the sine function, which is 1/x, goes through multiples of \u03c0 between 1/0.001 and 1/0.0001.\n\nSo, 1/x goes from 1000 to 10000 as x goes from 0.001 to 0.0001. So, the number of zeros is the number of times \u03b8=1/x crosses n\u03c0 between \u03b8=1000 and \u03b8=10000.\n\nEach crossing at \u03b8=n\u03c0 corresponds to a zero. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 <10000.\n\nWhich is the same as 1000/\u03c0 < n <10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.309886184 < n <3183.09886184.\n\nSo, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which gives 3183 -319 +1=2865.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let me recall that the sine function is zero at integer multiples of \u03c0. That is, sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 = n\u03c0, where n is an integer. So, for our function y = sin(1/x), setting it equal to zero gives sin(1/x) = 0. Therefore, 1/x must be equal to n\u03c0. \n\nSo, solving for x, we get x = 1/(n\u03c0). That means each x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n. Now, I need to find all such x that lie within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nLet me write that down: 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), substituting that into the inequality gives 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. \n\nNow, I can solve for n in this inequality. Let's rearrange each part. Starting with the left part: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that reversing inequalities when taking reciprocals, I get 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Calculating 1/0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0 gives n < 10000/\u03c0. \n\nSimilarly, for the right part of the inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals again, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. \n\nPutting both inequalities together, we have 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. \n\nNow, let me compute these numerical values. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, let's compute 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0.\n\nCalculating 1000 divided by \u03c0: 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184.\n\nSimilarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0: 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184.\n\nBut n has to be an integer, so n starts at the next integer after 318.309886184, which is 319, and goes up to the integer just below 3183.09886184, which is 3183.\n\nNow, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, actually, let me think. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, in this case, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nStarting with x = 1/(n\u03c0), and x must be between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals and flipping the inequalities: 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Then, dividing by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.31 < n < 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. \n\nNumber of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 minus 300 is 2883, minus 19 is 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 is 2865. So, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, maybe I should consider whether n can actually take those exact values. For example, when n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0). Let me compute 1/(319\u03c0) numerically to see if it's indeed greater than 0.0001.\n\nCalculating 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 319 * 3 = 957, 319 * 0.1416 \u2248 319 * 0.1 = 31.9, 319 * 0.0416 \u2248 ~13.25. So, total is approximately 957 + 31.9 + 13.25 \u2248 957 + 45.15 \u2248 1002.15. So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.15 \u2248 0.0009978, which is just under 0.001. Wait, but our interval is (0.0001, 0.001). So, 0.0009978 is less than 0.001, so x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009978 is within the interval.\n\nSimilarly, for n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0). Let's compute 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.1416 \u2248 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.0416 \u2248 ~132. So, total is approximately 9549 + 318.3 + 132 \u2248 9549 + 450.3 \u2248 9999.3. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.3 \u2248 0.000100007, which is just above 0.0001. So, that's within the interval as well.\n\nSo, both n = 319 and n = 3183 give x-values within (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the count from 319 to 3183 inclusive is correct.\n\nThus, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's any possibility that n could be such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001 or 0.001, but since the interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), we don't include the endpoints. So, we need to ensure that 1/(n\u03c0) is strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. \n\nWe saw that for n = 319, x \u2248 0.0009978 < 0.001, so it's included. For n = 3183, x \u2248 0.000100007 > 0.0001, so it's included. So, both endpoints of n correspond to x within the open interval. Therefore, our count from n = 319 to n = 3183 inclusive is correct, resulting in 2865 intercepts.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer should be 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where the function crosses the x-axis, i.e., where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

    "text": " Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the sine function is zero at integer multiples of \u03c0. So, sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 = n\u03c0, where n is an integer. In this case, \u03b8 is 1/x, so we can set up the equation 1/x = n\u03c0. Solving for x, we get x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, each x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n.\n\nNow, I need to find all such x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). That means I need to find all integers n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me write that down:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nI can solve for n in each inequality. Let's start with the left inequality:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0)\n\nIf I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that taking reciprocals reverses the inequality, I get:\n\n1/0.0001 > n\u03c0\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\n10000 > n\u03c0\n\nDividing both sides by \u03c0:\n\nn < 10000/\u03c0\n\nCalculating that, since \u03c0 is approximately 3.1416, 10000 divided by 3.1416 is roughly 3183.098. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.098. Since n is an integer, the maximum possible n here is 3183.\n\nNow, let's look at the right inequality:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nAgain, taking reciprocals:\n\nn\u03c0 > 1/0.001\n\nWhich is:\n\nn\u03c0 > 1000\n\nDividing both sides by \u03c0:\n\nn > 1000/\u03c0\n\nCalculating that, 1000 divided by 3.1416 is approximately 318.309. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309. Since n is an integer, the smallest possible n here is 319.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If n > 318.309, then the smallest integer n is 319, right? Because 318 would be less than 318.309, which doesn't satisfy the inequality.\n\nSo, n must be an integer between 319 and 3183, inclusive. To find the number of integers in this range, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add one (since both endpoints are included).\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865.\n\nWait a minute, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the lower bound for n is 319 and the upper bound is 3183. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1, so 3183 - 319 + 1 is indeed 2865.\n\nBut hold on, let me verify if x = 1/(n\u03c0) is indeed within the interval (0.0001, 0.001) for n from 319 to 3183.\n\nFor n = 319:\n\nx = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(319 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(1002.67) \u2248 0.000997, which is just below 0.001, so it's within the interval.\n\nFor n = 3183:\n\nx = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound. But the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x = 0.0001 is not included. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, so if n = 3183 gives x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower limit, but since the interval is open at 0.0001, this x is not included. So, n should go up to 3182 instead of 3183.\n\nLet me recalculate the upper bound. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001\n\nWhich gives n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183. But since x must be greater than 0.0001, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 10000/\u03c0. So, n can be 3183 only if 1/(3183\u03c0) > 0.0001.\n\nWait, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 1/(10000), which is 0.0001. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound. Since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so n must be less than 3183.098, but n has to be an integer, so the maximum n is 3183, but does 1/(3183\u03c0) equal exactly 0.0001? Let me check.\n\nCalculating 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.1416 \u2248 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.0416 \u2248 approximately 132. So total is approximately 9549 + 318.3 + 132 \u2248 9549 + 450.3 \u2248 9999.3. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.3, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.3 \u2248 0.000100007, which is just over 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100007, which is greater than 0.0001, so it is included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 1/(3183\u03c0) was approximately 0.0001, but actually it's just a bit over. So, n = 3183 is acceptable because x is just over 0.0001.\n\nBut wait, let me check with n = 3184. 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3184 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(10001.3) \u2248 0.000099987, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. So, n can go up to 3183 because 1/(3183\u03c0) is just over 0.0001, which is within the interval.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n = 3183 gives x \u2248 0.000100007, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. So, n goes from 319 to 3183, inclusive, which gives 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nBut let me double-check the calculations because I might have made a mistake in the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive.\n\nThe formula for the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me test with smaller numbers to make sure. For example, from 2 to 5 inclusive, the numbers are 2,3,4,5, which is 4 numbers. Using the formula: 5 - 2 + 1 = 4. Correct. So, applying the same logic, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. The number of oscillations increases as x approaches 0. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is very close to zero, the function oscillates very rapidly.\n\nEach oscillation of sin(1/x) corresponds to a period of 2\u03c0 in the \u03b8 = 1/x variable. So, as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001, \u03b8 increases from 1000 to 10000. So, the number of oscillations is (10000 - 1000)/(2\u03c0) = 9000/(2\u03c0) \u2248 1432.39. But wait, that's the number of periods. Each period has two zeros (one at the start and one in the middle), but actually, each period has one zero crossing every \u03c0 interval.\n\nWait, no, the zeros occur every \u03c0 interval, not every 2\u03c0. Because sin(\u03b8) is zero at \u03b8 = 0, \u03c0, 2\u03c0, 3\u03c0, etc. So, the number of zeros between \u03b8 = a and \u03b8 = b is floor(b/\u03c0) - floor(a/\u03c0). But in our case, \u03b8 = 1/x, so as x goes from 0.001 to 0.0001, \u03b8 goes from 1000 to 10000.\n\nSo, the number of zeros would be floor(10000/\u03c0) - floor(1000/\u03c0). Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so floor(10000/\u03c0) = 3183.\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so floor(1000/\u03c0) = 318.\n\nSo, the number of zeros is 3183 - 318 = 2865.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So, that confirms that the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nBut wait, in the first approach, I considered n starting from 319, which is floor(1000/\u03c0) + 1, and going up to 3183, which is floor(10000/\u03c0). So, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula floor(10000/\u03c0) - floor(1000/\u03c0) = 3183 - 318 = 2865.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that when n starts at 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) is indeed greater than 0.0001. Let's compute 1/(319\u03c0):\n\n319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 319 * 3 = 957, 319 * 0.1416 \u2248 45.13, so total \u2248 957 + 45.13 \u2248 1002.13. So, 1/1002.13 \u2248 0.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Wait, but earlier I thought 1/(319\u03c0) is approximately 0.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. But wait, 0.0009978 is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n = 319 is acceptable.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought about n = 3183, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100007, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. We need to find the number of such x in (0.0001, 0.001). Solving for n, we find n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

That is, sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 = n\u03c0, where n is an integer. So, if I set 1/x equal to n\u03c0, I can solve for x. That would give me x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, each x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n.\n\nNow, since I'm looking for x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), I can write that as 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Substituting x = 1/(n\u03c0) into this inequality, I get:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nI can solve this inequality for n to find the range of integers n that satisfy this condition. Let me write that down step by step.\n\nStarting with the left part of the inequality:\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0)\n\nIf I take reciprocals on both sides, I have to remember that taking reciprocals reverses the inequality. So, 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0, which is 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, I get n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nSimilarly, for the right part of the inequality:\n1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nAgain, taking reciprocals, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0, which is 1000 < n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, I get n > 1000/\u03c0.\n\nSo now, I have two inequalities:\nn > 1000/\u03c0\nn < 10000/\u03c0\n\nI need to find the integer values of n that satisfy both of these. Let me compute the numerical values of 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0 to find the range of n.\n\nCalculating 1000 divided by \u03c0:\n\u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184.\n\nSimilarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184.\n\nBut n has to be an integer. So, the smallest integer greater than 318.309886184 is 319, and the largest integer less than 3183.09886184 is 3183.\n\nTherefore, n can take integer values from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to count how many integers are in this range.\n\nTo find the number of integers from a to b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, applying that here:\n\nNumber of integers = 3183 - 319 + 1\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\n2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, 3183 - 319: Let me compute 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. So, yes, that's correct. Then adding 1 gives 2865.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure that n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, n = 319, 320, ..., 3183. So, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nLet me compute 3183 - 319:\n\n3183 - 300 = 2883\n\n2883 - 19 = 2864\n\nThen, 2864 + 1 = 2865.\n\nSo, there are 2865 integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, each of these integers n corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, the number of x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because as x approaches 0, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. So, in the interval from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is a small interval near zero, the function sin(1/x) will oscillate a large number of times, leading to many zeros.\n\nBut 2865 seems like a lot, but considering the interval is from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is a factor of 10 in x, but since the function's frequency is proportional to 1/x, the number of oscillations is proportional to the integral of 1/x over that interval, which is ln(0.001/0.0001) = ln(10) \u2248 2.3026, but that's the number of times the function completes a full cycle. But each cycle has two zeros, so maybe around 4.6 zeros? But that's not matching with 2865.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in my approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the function y = sin(1/x) has zeros where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, the number of zeros in (a, b) is the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (a, b), which is equivalent to n in (1/(b\u03c0), 1/(a\u03c0)).\n\nWait, that's what I did earlier. So, in this case, a = 0.0001 and b = 0.001.\n\nSo, 1/(b\u03c0) = 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184\n\n1/(a\u03c0) = 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the number of zeros should be proportional to the logarithm of the ratio of the interval endpoints. But that might be for a different kind of problem, perhaps when considering the number of oscillations in a logarithmic plot, but in this case, since we're directly counting the zeros by their positions, the number is indeed 2865.\n\nWait, let me check with specific numbers. Let's take n = 319:\n\nx = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.157) \u2248 0.0009978, which is greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001, so that's within the interval.\n\nSimilarly, n = 3183:\n\nx = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.05) \u2248 0.0000999995, which is just above 0.0001, so it's within the interval.\n\nWait, but 0.0000999995 is actually less than 0.0001, right? Because 0.0001 is 0.000100000, so 0.0000999995 is just below 0.0001. So, that would be outside the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, so maybe n = 3183 gives x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999995, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not in the interval. So, perhaps n can only go up to 3182.\n\nWait, let's compute 1/(3183\u03c0):\n\n3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, and 183\u03c0 \u2248 575.0186, so total \u2248 9424.77796 + 575.0186 \u2248 9999.79656.\n\nSo, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.79656 \u2248 0.000100002, which is just over 0.0001. So, that's within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, because 0.000100002 is greater than 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nWait, so perhaps my earlier calculation was slightly off. Let me compute 3183\u03c0 more accurately.\n\nCalculating 3183 * \u03c0:\n\n3183 * 3 = 9549\n\n3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3\n\n3183 * 0.0415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32\n\n3183 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 Approximately 5.07\n\nSo, adding those: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.07 \u2248 450.69\n\nSo, total 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 9549 + 450.69 \u2248 9999.69\n\nSo, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.69 \u2248 0.000100003, which is just over 0.0001, so it is included in the interval.\n\nSimilarly, n = 3183 gives x \u2248 0.000100003, which is within (0.0001, 0.001). So, n can go up to 3183.\n\nWait, but what about n = 3184?\n\n3184\u03c0 \u2248 3184 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 184\u03c0 \u2248 578.0186, so total \u2248 9424.77796 + 578.0186 \u2248 9999.79656 + 578.0186? Wait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, 3184 is 3183 + 1, so 3184\u03c0 \u2248 3183\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2248 9999.79656 + 3.1415926535 \u2248 10002.93815.\n\nSo, 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/10002.93815 \u2248 0.00009997, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. Therefore, n = 3184 would give x \u2248 0.00009997, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included.\n\nTherefore, the maximum n is 3183, and the minimum n is 319.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with a smaller example. Suppose I take a = 0.1 and b = 0.2.\n\nThen, 1/(b\u03c0) \u2248 1/(0.2 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/0.6283185307 \u2248 1.591549431.\n\n1/(a\u03c0) \u2248 1/(0.1 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/0.31415926535 \u2248 3.1830988618.\n\nSo, n must be greater than 1.5915 and less than 3.183098, so n = 2 and 3.\n\nNumber of integers: 3 - 2 + 1 = 2.\n\nBut let's check the x-intercepts in (0.1, 0.2):\n\nx = 1/(2\u03c0) \u2248 0.1591549431, which is in (0.1, 0.2).\n\nx = 1/(3\u03c0) \u2248 0.1061032929, which is in (0.1, 0.2).\n\nx = 1/(4\u03c0) \u2248 0.0795774715, which is less than 0.1, so not included.\n\nSo, there are 2 x-intercepts in (0.1, 0.2), which matches our calculation.\n\nSimilarly, in this case, with a = 0.0001 and b = 0.001, the calculation gives 2865 x-intercepts, which seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about the number of oscillations being proportional to the logarithm of the interval, but that might be a different approach. Let me see.\n\nThe number of zeros of sin(1/x) in (a, b) is equal to the number of n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (a, b), which is exactly what I calculated. So, the number is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)).\n\nIn this case, floor(1/(0.0001\u03c0)) = floor(3183.09886184) = 3183\n\nceil(1/(0.001\u03c0)) = ceil(318.309886184) = 319\n\nSo, number of zeros = 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the function sin(1/x) oscillates between -1 and 1 as x approaches 0. Each time 1/x increases by 2\u03c0, the sine function completes a full cycle, resulting in two zeros (one positive, one negative). So, the number of zeros in an interval (a, b) would be approximately the number of times 1/x increases by 2\u03c0 as x goes from a to b.\n\nSo, the change in 1/x from x = a to x = b is (1/a - 1/b). So, the number of zeros would be approximately (1/a - 1/b)/(2\u03c0).\n\nIn this case, (1/0.0001 - 1/0.001) = (10000 - 1000) = 9000.\n\nDivided by 2\u03c0, that's 9000/(2\u03c0) \u2248 9000/6.283185307 \u2248 1432.393.\n\nWait, but that's approximately 1432 zeros, but our exact calculation gave 2865. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in the approximation. Because each full cycle of 2\u03c0 in \u03b8 = 1/x corresponds to two zeros, so the number of zeros is approximately (\u0394\u03b8)/(\u03c0), not (\u0394\u03b8)/(2\u03c0). Because each \u03c0 interval in \u03b8 gives one zero.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The function sin(\u03b8) has a zero every \u03c0 interval, not every 2\u03c0. So, the number of zeros in \u03b8 between \u03b81 and \u03b82 is approximately (\u03b82 - \u03b81)/\u03c0.\n\nIn our case, \u03b8 = 1/x, so \u03b81 = 1/0.0001 = 10000, \u03b82 = 1/0.001 = 1000.\n\nSo, the number of zeros would be approximately (\u03b81 - \u03b82)/\u03c0 = (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 \u2248 9000/3.1415926535 \u2248 2866.198.\n\nWhich is very close to our exact calculation of 2865. So, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the approximate method gives around 2866 zeros, and the exact calculation gives 2865, which is very close. The slight difference is due to the fact that the endpoints might not exactly align with the zeros, so the exact count is 2865.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the number of x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2865.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me test with n = 319 and n = 3183 to ensure that their corresponding x values are within the interval.\n\nFor n = 319:\n\nx = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.157) \u2248 0.0009978, which is between 0.0001 and 0.001.\n\nFor n = 3183:\n\nx = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.05) \u2248 0.0000999995, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100003, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included. So, both endpoints are included.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 2865.\n\nSo, after all this thinking and checking, I believe the correct number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let me recall that sin(\u03b8) is zero when \u03b8 is an integer multiple of \u03c0. So, sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 = n\u03c0, where n is any integer. In this case, \u03b8 is 1/x, so I can set up the equation 1/x = n\u03c0. Solving for x, I get x = 1/(n\u03c0). \n\nNow, since I'm looking for x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), I can write that as 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Substituting x = 1/(n\u03c0) into this inequality, I get:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nI need to solve this inequality for n. Let me rewrite the inequalities:\n\nFirst, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Let me solve for n. Taking reciprocals on both sides (remembering that flipping the inequality when taking reciprocals since both sides are positive):\n\n1/0.0001 > n\u03c0\n\nWhich is 10000 > n\u03c0, so dividing both sides by \u03c0:\n\nn < 10000/\u03c0\n\nSimilarly, the second inequality is 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals:\n\nn\u03c0 > 1/0.001\n\nWhich is n\u03c0 > 1000, so:\n\nn > 1000/\u03c0\n\nSo, putting it all together, n must satisfy:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nNow, I can compute these values numerically to find the range of integers n that satisfy this inequality.\n\nFirst, let's calculate 1000/\u03c0. Since \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly:\n\n1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184\n\nSimilarly, 10000/\u03c0 is:\n\n10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184.\n\nBut n has to be an integer because it's in the equation sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, and n is an integer. So, the smallest integer n can be is 319 (since 318.309 is less than 319), and the largest integer n can be is 3183 (since 3183.098 is just a bit more than 3183, so the integer part is 3183).\n\nNow, to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To compute this, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then add 1 (since both endpoints are included).\n\nWait, hold on: 319 to 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\n2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nSo, there are 2865 integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, each integer n corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, the number of x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when dealing with inequalities and reciprocals, it's easy to flip the inequality sign or miscalculate.\n\nSo, starting again:\n\nWe have 0.0001 < x < 0.001\n\nx = 1/(n\u03c0), so substituting:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nTaking reciprocals (and flipping inequalities because reciprocals reverse the order for positive numbers):\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing all parts by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nWhich is approximately 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184\n\nSo, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183. Now, how many integers is that?\n\n3183 - 319 + 1 = ?\n\nLet me compute 3183 - 319:\n\n3183 - 300 = 2883\n\n2883 - 19 = 2864\n\nThen, 2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 2865 integers.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me think about the endpoints. Is x = 1/(319\u03c0) greater than 0.0001?\n\nCompute 1/(319\u03c0):\n\n1/(319 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(1002.3) \u2248 0.0009977, which is approximately 0.0009977, which is less than 0.001. Wait, but 0.0009977 is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. But 0.0009977 is greater than 0.0001, so that's good.\n\nSimilarly, x = 1/(3183\u03c0):\n\n1/(3183 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, but since n is 3183, it's 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010000..., which is just over 0.0001. Wait, no, actually, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 is just over 10000, 1/(3183\u03c0) is just under 0.0001. Wait, that can't be, because 3183 * \u03c0 is approximately 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0.\n\n3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 Let's compute 3000 * 3.1416 = 9424.8, and 183 * 3.1416 \u2248 183 * 3 = 549, 183 * 0.1416 \u2248 25.96, so total \u2248 549 + 25.96 \u2248 574.96. So, total 9424.8 + 574.96 \u2248 9999.76. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.76, which is just under 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.76 \u2248 0.0001000024, which is just over 0.0001.\n\nSo, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000024, which is just above 0.0001, so it's within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009977, which is just under 0.001, so it's also within the interval.\n\nTherefore, both endpoints correspond to x-values within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, each integer n from 319 to 3183 gives an x-intercept within that interval.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me check the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive.\n\nThe formula for the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1.\n\nSo, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, leading to x = 1/(n\u03c0). Within the interval (0.0001, 0.001), n ranges from 319 to 3183, resulting in 2865 x-intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

    "text": " Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 is an integer multiple of \u03c0. So, if I set 1/x equal to n\u03c0, where n is an integer, then sin(1/x) will be zero. That gives me x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n.\n\nNow, I need to find all such x that lie within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, I can write the inequality:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nI can solve this inequality for n to find the range of integers n that satisfy it.\n\nLet me start by solving the left part of the inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that reversing the inequality when taking reciprocals, I get:\n\n1/0.0001 > n\u03c0\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\n10000 > n\u03c0\n\nDividing both sides by \u03c0:\n\nn < 10000/\u03c0\n\nCalculating 10000 divided by \u03c0, approximately 10000 / 3.1416 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.098.\n\nNow, solving the right part of the inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals:\n\nn\u03c0 > 1/0.001\n\nWhich is:\n\nn\u03c0 > 1000\n\nDividing both sides by \u03c0:\n\nn > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098\n\nSo, n must be greater than approximately 318.3098.\n\nSince n has to be an integer, n must satisfy:\n\n319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183\n\nNow, let me check if these values of n are valid. When n = 318, 1/(n\u03c0) \u2248 1/(318 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/1000.05 \u2248 0.00099995, which is just less than 0.001, so n=318 gives x \u2248 0.00099995, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Wait, but earlier I had n > 318.3098, so n starts at 319. But wait, when n=318, 1/(n\u03c0) is approximately 0.00099995, which is just under 0.001, so it's within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So maybe I should include n=318 as well.\n\nWait, let me recast the inequality. The original inequality is 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, solving for n:\n\n1/(0.001) > n\u03c0 > 1/(0.0001)\n\nWhich is 1000 > n\u03c0 > 10000\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because 1/(n\u03c0) is between 0.0001 and 0.001, so 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n\u03c0 < 10000, and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n\u03c0 > 1000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nCalculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098.\n\nSo, n must be an integer greater than 318.3098 and less than 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183, inclusive.\n\nNow, how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive? To find the count, subtract 318 from 3183: 3183 - 318 = 2865. Wait, but wait, 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, let me check that again. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, from 319 to 3183, it's 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm whether n=3183 is included. Since 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound of the interval. But the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001.\n\nSo, when n=3183, 1/(n\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is exactly the lower bound, but since the interval is open, x=0.0001 is not included. So, n=3183 would give x=0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but since 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded, we need to take n up to 3182.\n\nWait, let me check that. If n=3183, then 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, which is the lower limit, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), it's open, so x must be greater than 0.0001, so n must satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which is n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n can be up to 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is 0.0001, which is not included. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is 0.0001, which is excluded. So, perhaps n can go up to 3182.\n\nWait, let me compute 1/(3182\u03c0). Let's see, 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's compute 3000*3.1416=9424.8, 182*3.1416\u2248571.55, so total \u2248 9424.8 + 571.55 \u2248 9996.35. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.35 \u2248 0.000100037, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n=3182 gives x\u22480.000100037, which is within the interval.\n\nWait, but 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9996.35, so 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100037, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included. So, n can go up to 3182, and 1/(3182\u03c0) is included, while n=3183 would give exactly 0.0001, which is excluded.\n\nSimilarly, for the lower bound, n must be greater than 318.3098, so n starts at 319.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but that was including n=3183, which we can't include because it gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. So, the correct count should be from n=319 to n=3182, which is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculation: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0) which is approximately 1/(1003.79) \u2248 0.0009962, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. And n=3182 gives x\u22480.000100037, which is just above 0.0001, so included. So, the number of integers between 319 and 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but let me compute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 is 2882, minus 19 is 2863, then plus 1 is 2864. So, 2864 integers.\n\nBut wait, let me check with another approach. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, a=319, b=3182. So, 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, 2864 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n=3183 would give x=0.0001, which is excluded, so n goes up to 3182, which is included, so the count is 2864.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when dealing with inequalities, especially with reciprocals, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me check with specific values.\n\nTake n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.79) \u2248 0.0009962, which is less than 0.001, so included.\n\nTake n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(9996.35) \u2248 0.000100037, which is just over 0.0001, so included.\n\nTake n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, which is excluded because the interval is open at 0.0001.\n\nTake n=318: x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.05) \u2248 0.00099995, which is just under 0.001, so included. Wait, but earlier I thought n must be greater than 318.3098, so n starts at 319. But here, n=318 gives x\u22480.00099995, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, maybe I made a mistake earlier by excluding n=318.\n\nWait, let's go back to the inequality. The original inequality is 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nSo, solving for n:\n\n1/(0.001) > n\u03c0 > 1/(0.0001)\n\nWhich is 1000 > n\u03c0 > 10000\n\nWait, that can't be right because 1/(n\u03c0) is between 0.0001 and 0.001, so 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n\u03c0 < 10000, and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n\u03c0 > 1000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.3098 < n < 3183.098.\n\nSo, n can be from 319 up to 3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so n goes up to 3182.\n\nBut when n=318, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099995, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n=318 is included because 0.00099995 < 0.001, so x=0.00099995 is within the interval.\n\nWait, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.3098, so n=318 is less than that, so it shouldn't be included. Hmm, this is a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in solving the inequality. Let me go through it again.\n\nGiven 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nFirst, solve 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001.\n\nMultiplying both sides by n\u03c0 (assuming n>0, which it is since x is positive):\n\n1 > 0.0001 * n\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by 0.0001:\n\n10000 > n\u03c0\n\nSo, n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098.\n\nThen, solve 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001:\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0:\n\n1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by 0.001:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0\n\nSo, n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 318.3098 < n < 3183.098.\n\nTherefore, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so n goes up to 3182.\n\nBut then, n=318: 318 > 318.3098? No, 318 is less than 318.3098, so n=318 is not included. So, n starts at 319.\n\nWait, but when n=318, 1/(n\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099995, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, why does the inequality say n must be greater than 318.3098? Because when n=318, 1/(n\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099995, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, perhaps the inequality is not strict on the lower side?\n\nWait, let me check: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098. So, n must be greater than 318.3098, so the smallest integer n is 319.\n\nBut when n=318, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099995 < 0.001, so it's included. So, perhaps the inequality should be n \u2265 319, but n=318 also satisfies 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Wait, no, because 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 requires n > 318.3098, so n=318 is less than that, so it doesn't satisfy the inequality. But in reality, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099995 < 0.001, so it does satisfy the inequality. So, perhaps the inequality is not correct because when n=318, 1/(n\u03c0) is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nWait, let me think again. The inequality is 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nSo, for n=318, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099995, which is greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001, so it's included. So, n=318 is valid.\n\nWait, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.3098, so n=318 is less than that, but it still satisfies the condition. So, perhaps the inequality is not tight? Or maybe I made a mistake in the algebra.\n\nWait, let's solve 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0:\n\n1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by 0.001:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0\n\nSo, n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098.\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.3098, so n=319 is the smallest integer.\n\nBut when n=318, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099995 < 0.001, which is true, so n=318 is included. So, perhaps the inequality is correct, but n=318 is included because 318\u03c0 \u2248 1000.05, so 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099995 < 0.001.\n\nWait, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.3098, so n=318 is less than that, but it still satisfies 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, perhaps the inequality is not strict? Or maybe I made a mistake in the direction.\n\nWait, let me check: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0 (positive, so inequality remains same):\n\n1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by 0.001:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0\n\nSo, n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098.\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.3098, so n=319 is the smallest integer.\n\nBut when n=318, 318 > 318.3098? No, 318 is less than 318.3098, so n=318 is not greater than 318.3098, so it doesn't satisfy the inequality. But when I plug in n=318, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099995 < 0.001, which is true, so it's included. So, there's a contradiction here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction when multiplying both sides. Let me go through it again.\n\nStarting with 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nSince n and \u03c0 are positive, I can multiply both sides by n\u03c0 without changing the inequality:\n\n1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0\n\nThen, divide both sides by 0.001:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0\n\nWhich is correct. So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098.\n\nSo, n=318 is less than 318.3098, so it doesn't satisfy n > 318.3098, so it shouldn't be included. But when I compute 1/(318\u03c0), it's less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval.\n\nWait, this seems contradictory. Let me compute 318 * \u03c0:\n\n318 * \u03c0 \u2248 318 * 3.14159265 \u2248 318 * 3 = 954, 318 * 0.14159265 \u2248 318 * 0.1416 \u2248 45.0048, so total \u2248 954 + 45.0048 \u2248 1000.0048.\n\nSo, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/1000.0048 \u2248 0.000999995, which is just under 0.001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n=318 is valid, even though n=318 is less than 318.3098.\n\nWait, so perhaps the inequality is correct, but n=318 is included because 318\u03c0 \u2248 1000.0048, which is just over 1000, so 1/(318\u03c0) is just under 0.001, which is included. So, perhaps the inequality is not strict? Or maybe I should adjust the inequality.\n\nWait, let's solve for n in 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0:\n\n1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0\n\nDivide by 0.001:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0\n\nSo, n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.3098, so the smallest integer n is 319.\n\nBut when n=318, 1/(n\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999995 < 0.001, so it's included. So, the inequality seems to suggest n must be greater than 318.3098, but n=318 is less than that and still satisfies the condition. So, perhaps the inequality is not tight, and n can be as low as 318.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if n=318 satisfies the inequality 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nCompute 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999995 < 0.001, so yes, it's true. So, n=318 is valid.\n\nSimilarly, n=319: 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.79) \u2248 0.0009962 < 0.001, so it's included.\n\nWait, so perhaps the inequality should be n \u2265 319, but n=318 is also valid. So, maybe the inequality is n \u2265 318, but n must be greater than 318.3098, so n=318 is just below that, but still valid.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Maybe it's better to consider that n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so n must be between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.3098 < n < 3183.098.\n\nSo, n can be any integer from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. But when n=3183, 1/(n\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded because the interval is open at 0.0001. So, n=3183 is excluded, so the maximum n is 3182.\n\nSimilarly, n=318: 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999995 < 0.001, so it's included, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.3098, so n=318 is less than that, so it shouldn't be included. But in reality, it is included.\n\nThis suggests that the inequality might not capture all cases correctly because when n=318, 1/(n\u03c0) is still less than 0.001, even though n is less than 318.3098. So, perhaps the correct range for n is from 318 up to 3182, inclusive.\n\nWait, let me compute 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999995, which is less than 0.001, so included.\n\n1/(317\u03c0) \u2248 1/(317*3.1416) \u2248 1/(1000.00 - let's compute 317*3.1416: 300*3.1416=942.48, 17*3.1416\u224853.407, total\u2248942.48+53.407\u2248995.887. So, 1/(317\u03c0)\u22481/995.887\u22480.001004, which is greater than 0.001, so it's excluded.\n\nSo, n=317 gives x\u22480.001004, which is just over 0.001, so it's excluded. So, n=318 is the first n where x is less than 0.001.\n\nSo, n starts at 318, because n=318 gives x\u22480.000999995 < 0.001, and n=317 gives x\u22480.001004 > 0.001, which is excluded.\n\nSo, n starts at 318, and goes up to 3182, inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 318 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 318 + 1.\n\nCompute 3182 - 318: 3182 - 300 = 2882, minus 18 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865.\n\nWait, that's different from earlier. Let me compute 3182 - 318 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865.\n\nWait, so if n starts at 318 and ends at 3182, inclusive, the number of terms is 2865.\n\nBut earlier, I thought n starts at 319, but that was a mistake because n=318 is valid.\n\nSo, the correct count is from n=318 to n=3182, which is 2865 integers.\n\nWait, let me confirm with specific values.\n\nn=318: x\u22480.000999995, included.\n\nn=3182: x\u22480.000100037, included.\n\nn=3183: x\u22480.0001, excluded.\n\nn=317: x\u22480.001004, excluded.\n\nSo, n runs from 318 to 3182, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 318 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2864, but that was because I mistakenly excluded n=318. So, the correct count is 2865.\n\nWait, let me compute 3182 - 318 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. So, 318 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nCompute 3182 - 318 = 2864, then add 1 to include both endpoints, so 2865.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of x-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we set \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\). This occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for integers \\( n \\), leading to \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n\nWe need \\( x \\) to satisfy \\( 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\).\n\n1. **Solve the inequalities for \\( n \\):**\n   - From \\( \\frac{1}{n\\pi} > 0.0001 \\):\n     \\[\n     n < \\frac{1}{0.0001 \\pi} \\approx 3183.098\n     \\]\n   - From \\( \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\):\n     \\[\n     n > \\frac{1}{0.001 \\pi} \\approx 318.3098\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the range of \\( n \\):**\n   - \\( n \\) must be an integer satisfying \\( 318.3098 < n < 3183.098 \\).\n   - Thus, \\( n \\) ranges from 319 to 3183.

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let me recall that sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 is an integer multiple of \u03c0. So, for sin(1/x) = 0, that implies 1/x = n\u03c0, where n is an integer. Therefore, solving for x, I get x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n.\n\nNow, the interval given is (0.0001, 0.001). Let me write that in decimal form to make it clearer. 0.0001 is 10^-4, and 0.001 is 10^-3. So, I need to find all integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies between 10^-4 and 10^-3.\n\nSo, mathematically, I can write this as:\n10^-4 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 10^-3.\n\nI need to solve for n here. Let me rearrange the inequality to find the range of n. \n\nStarting with the left inequality:\n10^-4 < 1/(n\u03c0)\nTaking reciprocals on both sides (and remembering that flipping the inequality sign when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive), we get:\n10^4 > n\u03c0\nSo, n < 10^4 / \u03c0.\n\nSimilarly, the right inequality:\n1/(n\u03c0) < 10^-3\nTaking reciprocals again:\nn\u03c0 > 10^3\nSo, n > 10^3 / \u03c0.\n\nTherefore, n must satisfy:\n10^3 / \u03c0 < n < 10^4 / \u03c0.\n\nNow, let me compute these values numerically to find the integer bounds for n.\n\nFirst, compute 10^3 / \u03c0:\n10^3 is 1000, so 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184.\n\nSimilarly, 10^4 / \u03c0 is 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184.\n\nSince n has to be an integer, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183.\n\nNow, to find how many integers are in this range from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, actually, let me think. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1.\n\nSo, here, a = 319 and b = 3183.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, 3183 - 319 is actually 2864? Let me do that subtraction step by step.\n\n3183 minus 300 is 2883, then minus 19 more is 2864. Yes, that's correct. So, adding 1 gives 2865.\n\nSo, that would mean there are 2865 x-intercepts in that interval.\n\nWait a second, but let me think again. Because x = 1/(n\u03c0) must lie in (0.0001, 0.001). So, when n increases, x decreases. So, as n goes from 319 to 3183, x goes from just below 1/(319\u03c0) to just above 1/(3183\u03c0). Wait, but let me check if 1/(319\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001 and 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.001.\n\nWait, let me compute 1/(319\u03c0):\n\n1/(319 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(1002.82) \u2248 0.000997, which is about 0.001, but actually just a bit less than 0.001. Wait, that's confusing because 1000/\u03c0 is approximately 318.31, so 1/(319\u03c0) is approximately 1/(1002.82) \u2248 0.000997, which is just below 0.001. Similarly, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 1/(10000.000...) which is 0.0001. Wait, but 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001.\n\nWait, but the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) must be in that range. So, when n is 319, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000997, which is just below 0.001, so it's within the interval. Similarly, when n is 3183, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since the interval is open at 0.0001, we need to check if 1/(n\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001.\n\nWait, so maybe I made a mistake in including n = 3183. Let me check 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.000...) which is exactly 0.0001, but the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001. Therefore, 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001, so n must be less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n can be up to 3183, because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound. But since the interval is open at 0.0001, does that mean that x must be greater than 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, n must be less than 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 3183.09886184. So, the maximum integer n is 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is not included in the interval. Therefore, perhaps the maximum n should be 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) would be slightly greater than 0.0001.\n\nWait, let me compute 1/(3182\u03c0):\n\n3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let me compute 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, and 182 * \u03c0 \u2248 571.5545, so total \u2248 9424.77796 + 571.5545 \u2248 10,000 - let's see, 9424.77796 + 571.5545 = 9996.33246. So, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9996.33246, so 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.33246 \u2248 0.000100037, which is just over 0.0001, so it is included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nSimilarly, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 183\u03c0 \u2248 575.0116, so total \u2248 9424.77796 + 575.0116 \u2248 9999.78956. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.78956 \u2248 0.000100002, which is just over 0.0001 as well. Wait, but that seems conflicting with my earlier thought that 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10,000.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me check 3183 * \u03c0 more accurately.\n\nWait, 3183 * \u03c0: Let me compute 3183 * 3.1415926535.\n\nCompute 3000 * \u03c0 = 9424.77796077\n\nCompute 183 * \u03c0: 183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 183 * 3 = 549, 183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 183 * 0.1 = 18.3, 183 * 0.0415926535 \u2248 183 * 0.04 = 7.32, and 183 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 ~0.291. So total \u2248 18.3 + 7.32 + 0.291 \u2248 25.911. So, 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 549 + 25.911 \u2248 574.911.\n\nSo, 3000\u03c0 + 183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796 + 574.911 \u2248 9999.68896.\n\nSo, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.68896, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.68896 \u2248 0.000100003, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval.\n\nWait, so if 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100003, which is greater than 0.0001, then x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n can be up to 3183. But when n = 3183, x \u2248 0.000100003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought that 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, that's not accurate. It's actually 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.68896, which is just under 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is just over 0.0001.\n\nWait, so then n can go up to 3183, because x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100003, which is within the interval.\n\nSimilarly, when n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.82) \u2248 0.000997, which is just below 0.001, so it's within the interval.\n\nSo, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183, inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 is 2865.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, there are 2865 x-intercepts in that interval.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Because when n increases by 1, x decreases by 1/(n(n+1)\u03c0), right? So, each x is distinct and lies within the interval, so each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept in the interval.\n\nSo, the total number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another approach. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a very small interval near zero, the function oscillates rapidly. Each time 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0, the function crosses zero.\n\nSo, the number of zeros is roughly the number of times 1/x passes through multiples of \u03c0 as x moves from 0.001 down to 0.0001. \n\nSo, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001), which is exactly what we calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of the length of the interval in terms of 1/x. Let me consider substitution: Let t = 1/x, so when x is in (0.0001, 0.001), t is in (1000, 10000). So, t ranges from 1000 to 10000. The function becomes y = sin(t). The zeros of sin(t) occur at t = n\u03c0 for integer n.\n\nSo, we need to find how many integers n satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nDividing through by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nWhich is the same as before: n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which gives 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nSo, that confirms the earlier result.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that 1000/\u03c0 is indeed approximately 318.309886184. Let me compute 1000 divided by \u03c0:\n\n\u03c0 \u2248 3.1415926535, so 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. Correct.\n\nSo, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me test with n=319 and n=3183.\n\nFor n=319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.82) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nFor n=3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(9999.68896) \u2248 0.000100003, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nSo, both endpoints are included, so the count is correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

So, for sin(1/x) to be zero, 1/x must be equal to n\u03c0. That gives me x = 1/(n\u03c0). \n\nSo, each x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n. Now, I need to find all such x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). That means I need to find all integers n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nLet me write that inequality down: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. I can solve for n here. Let's start by flipping the inequalities because I'm dealing with reciprocals. Remember that flipping inequalities reverses them if I'm dealing with positive numbers, which I am here since n is positive.\n\nSo, if I take reciprocals, the inequality becomes 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those, 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nNow, I can divide all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute those values. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535.\n\nCalculating 1000/\u03c0: 1000 divided by 3.1415926535 is roughly 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 is 10000 divided by 3.1415926535, which is approximately 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183.\n\nNow, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers, I can subtract the smaller number from the larger one and add 1. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nLet me compute that: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Each of these integers corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0).\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that calculation. 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be sure, maybe I can compute 3183 - 319: 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then minus 19 is 2864. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, does that mean there are 2865 x-intercepts? That seems like a lot, but considering the interval is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a very narrow range near zero, and the function sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times as x approaches zero, it makes sense that there are so many intercepts in such a small interval.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial inequality. I started with 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Then, taking reciprocals, I got 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which seems correct because taking reciprocals of positive numbers reverses the inequality.\n\nThen, dividing by \u03c0, I correctly got 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be an integer between 319 and 3183 inclusive, which gives 2865 integers. So, that seems correct.\n\nJust to think about it another way: The function sin(1/x) has a period of 2\u03c0/(1/x) = 2\u03c0x. But as x approaches zero, the period approaches zero, meaning the function oscillates more and more rapidly. So, between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a factor of 10 difference, the number of oscillations would be roughly proportional to the integral of 1/x over that interval, but maybe that's overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, since each zero crossing corresponds to a multiple of \u03c0 in 1/x, the number of zeros should be the number of integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval. So, that's exactly what I did, and I got 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check: 1/(n\u03c0) must be between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, n must be between 1/(0.001\u03c0) and 1/(0.0001\u03c0), which is 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, as I had before.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183, which is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute 3183 - 319. Let me do that step by step. 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then minus 19 is 2864. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the number of x-intercepts is 2865. So, the final answer should be 2865, put inside a box as \\boxed{2865}.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

Calculating 1/0.0001, that's 10,000. So, 10,000 > n\u03c0, which means n < 10,000/\u03c0. \n\nSimilarly, the right inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals again, and reversing the inequality, I get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0.\n\nNow, let me compute these values numerically to find the range of n. \n\nFirst, 10,000 divided by \u03c0. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10,000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n is an integer, the maximum possible n is 3183.\n\nNext, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618. Since n is an integer, the smallest possible n is 319.\n\nSo, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nTo find the number of integers between a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the numbers: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me calculate that.\n\n3183 minus 319 is 2864, and then adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nWait, let me check that subtraction again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more gives 2864. Yes, that's correct. So, adding 1 gives 2865.\n\nTherefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nI should just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any errors. \n\n1. I set sin(1/x) = 0, leading to 1/x = n\u03c0.\n2. Solved for x = 1/(n\u03c0).\n3. Plugged into the interval to get 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n4. Took reciprocals correctly, remembering to flip the inequalities.\n5. Calculated 10,000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098 and 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309.\n6. Determined n must be from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n7. Counted the integers: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nEverything seems to check out. So, I think 2865 is the correct number of x-intercepts in that interval.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\):\n\n1. **Identify where the function equals zero**: The sine function is zero at integer multiples of \\( \\pi \\), so \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\) implies \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) where \\( n \\) is an integer.

    "text": " \n\nLet me think about how to approach this. First, I remember that sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 is an integer multiple of \u03c0. So, sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 = k\u03c0, where k is an integer. In this case, \u03b8 is 1/x, so I can set up the equation 1/x = k\u03c0. Solving for x, I get x = 1/(k\u03c0). \n\nSo, each x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(k\u03c0) for some integer k. Now, I need to find all such x that lie within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). That means I need to find all integers k such that 0.0001 < 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001. \n\nLet me write that inequality down: 0.0001 < 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001. To find the range of k, I can take reciprocals on all parts of the inequality, but I have to remember that taking reciprocals reverses the inequalities. So, if I take reciprocals, I get 1/0.001 < k\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. \n\nCalculating those reciprocals: 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, the inequality becomes 1000 < k\u03c0 < 10000. Now, to solve for k, I can divide all parts by \u03c0. So, 1000/\u03c0 < k < 10000/\u03c0. \n\nLet me compute these values numerically. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. \n\nSince k must be an integer, I need to find all integers k such that k is greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184. That means k starts at the next integer after 318.309..., which is 319, and goes up to the integer just below 3183.098..., which is 3183. \n\nSo, the integers k go from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Now, I need to count how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is given by b - a + 1. So, in this case, it's 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. \n\nWait a second, let me double-check that. If I have numbers from 1 to n, the count is n. So, from 319 to 3183, the count is 3183 - 318 = 2865. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 3183 - 319 + 1: Let me compute 3183 minus 319. 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, yes, that's correct. \n\nBut hold on, I want to make sure that 1/(k\u03c0) is indeed within (0.0001, 0.001). Let me check for k = 319: 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(319 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(1002.003) \u2248 0.000998, which is just under 0.001. So, that's good. \n\nNow, for k = 3183: 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000.001) \u2248 0.00009999999, which is just over 0.0001. So, that's also good. \n\nWait, but when k = 3183, 1/(k\u03c0) is approximately 0.00009999999, which is just barely above 0.0001. So, that's within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nWait, but if k is 3184, then 1/(3184\u03c0) would be slightly less than 0.0001, right? Let me check: 3184\u03c0 \u2248 3184 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 10003.14, so 1/10003.14 \u2248 0.000099968, which is less than 0.0001. So, that's outside the interval. So, k can't be 3184 or higher because those x-values would be less than 0.0001, which is the lower bound of our interval. \n\nSimilarly, if k is 318, then 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(318 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(1000.000...) \u2248 0.001, which is exactly the upper bound, but our interval is open at 0.001, so we don't include x = 0.001. Therefore, k = 318 would give x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.001, which is not included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, k starts at 319, as I thought earlier. \n\nSo, to recap, the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(k\u03c0) where k is an integer from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of such integers is 3183 - 319 + 1, which is 2865. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the counting. Let's think of it as the number of integers between a and b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, if a = 319 and b = 3183, then the count is 3183 - 319 + 1. \n\nCalculating 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, that seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as starting from k = 1 up to k = 3183, which is 3183 numbers, and then subtracting the numbers from k = 1 up to k = 318, which is 318 numbers. So, 3183 - 318 = 2865. Yep, that's the same result. \n\nSo, that should be the number of x-intercepts. Therefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nI think that makes sense because as x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, and sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. So, between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a small interval near zero, the function will cross the x-axis a large number of times, which in this case is 2865 times. \n\nJust to make sure, let me think about the period of sin(1/x). The period of sin(\u03b8) is 2\u03c0, so the period of sin(1/x) would be such that 1/(x + T) - 1/x = 2\u03c0. But maybe it's easier to think in terms of how many oscillations occur between 0.0001 and 0.001. \n\nThe number of oscillations is roughly the change in \u03b8 divided by 2\u03c0. \u03b8 = 1/x, so when x goes from 0.0001 to 0.001, \u03b8 goes from 10000 to 1000. So, the change in \u03b8 is 10000 - 1000 = 9000. The number of periods is 9000 / (2\u03c0) \u2248 9000 / 6.283 \u2248 1432. So, the number of zeros should be roughly twice that, since each period has two zeros. So, 1432 * 2 \u2248 2864, which is close to 2865. That seems consistent. \n\nSo, my final answer is 2865 x-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(k\u03c0) for integer k. To find the number of such x in (0.0001, 0.001), we solve 0.0001 < 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001, leading to k ranging from 319 to 3183. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let me recall what the sine function looks like. The sine function has a period of 2\u03c0, and it crosses zero at every integer multiple of \u03c0. So, sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 = n\u03c0, where n is an integer. That makes sense because sine of 0 is 0, sine of \u03c0 is 0, sine of 2\u03c0 is 0, and so on. So, if I set 1/x equal to n\u03c0, then x would be 1/(n\u03c0). \n\nSo, for each integer n, x = 1/(n\u03c0) is an x-intercept. Now, I need to find all such x that lie within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Let me write that down:\n\n0.0001 < x < 0.001\n\nBut since x = 1/(n\u03c0), I can substitute that in:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nNow, I can solve for n in this inequality. Let me do that step by step.\n\nFirst, let's take the reciprocal of all parts of the inequality, remembering that reversing the inequalities when taking reciprocals because all terms are positive. So,\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nCalculating those:\n\n1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So,\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nNow, divide all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nCalculating 1000 divided by \u03c0. Since \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 1000/\u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184.\n\nSimilarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184.\n\nBut n has to be an integer because n\u03c0 is where sine is zero. So, n must be an integer such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183.\n\nWait, let me check that. If n has to be greater than 318.309..., then the smallest integer n is 319. Similarly, n has to be less than 3183.098..., so the largest integer n is 3183.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive.\n\nNow, to find how many integers are in this range, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then add 1 (since both endpoints are inclusive).\n\nWait, hold on. Let me think carefully. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. But in this case, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. So, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\n2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me double-check.\n\nWait, 319 to 3183: So, if I have numbers from 1 to 3183, that's 3183 numbers. From 1 to 318, that's 318 numbers. So, from 319 to 3183 is 3183 - 318 = 2865 numbers. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, there are 2865 integer values of n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. So, x = 1/(n\u03c0) must be between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Then, taking reciprocals, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Then, dividing by \u03c0, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n is from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again:\n\n3183 minus 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, 2865 intercepts.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, let me check with n = 319 and n = 3183.\n\nFor n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0). Let's compute that. 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 319 * 3 = 957, 319 * 0.1416 \u2248 319 * 0.1 = 31.9, 319 * 0.0416 \u2248 13.23. So total \u2248 957 + 31.9 + 13.23 \u2248 957 + 45.13 \u2248 1002.13. So, x \u2248 1/1002.13 \u2248 0.0009978, which is approximately 0.001. Wait, but 0.0009978 is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. But wait, 0.0001 is 1e-4, and 0.001 is 1e-3. So, 0.0009978 is just below 0.001, so it's included. \n\nSimilarly, for n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0). Let's compute 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 Let's see, 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77, 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.1416 \u2248 575. So, total is approximately 9424.77 + 575 \u2248 10,000. So, x \u2248 1/10,000 = 0.0001. But 0.0001 is the lower bound, and the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x = 0.0001 is not included. So, n = 3183 gives x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since the interval is open, do we include n = 3183?\n\nWait, this is a crucial point. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, meaning it doesn't include the endpoints. So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but it's actually slightly larger than 0.0001 because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but just barely above 0.0001 because 3183\u03c0 is slightly less than 10,000, right?\n\nWait, let me compute 3183 * \u03c0 more accurately. Let's compute 3183 * 3.1415926535.\n\n3183 * 3 = 9549\n\n3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3\n\n3183 * 0.0415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32\n\n3183 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 Approximately 3183 * 0.001 = 3.183, and 3183 * 0.0005926535 \u2248 ~1.885\n\nSo, adding up: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62; 445.62 + 3.183 \u2248 448.803; 448.803 + 1.885 \u2248 450.688.\n\nSo, total 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 9549 + 450.688 \u2248 10,000 - approximately 10,000. So, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 10,000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since 3183\u03c0 is slightly less than 10,000, 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly more than 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is just above 0.0001, which is within the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n = 3183 is included.\n\nSimilarly, for n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.13) \u2248 0.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, giving 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me check n = 318: x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.00) \u2248 0.001, but since 318\u03c0 \u2248 1000, so x \u2248 0.001. But the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which doesn't include 0.001, so n = 318 would give x \u2248 0.001, which is excluded. So, n must start at 319, not 318.\n\nSimilarly, n = 3184: x = 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10003.1) \u2248 0.00009996, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, n goes up to 3183.\n\nSo, yes, n is from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive. So, the formula is (last - first) + 1. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 gives 2865. So, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about the behavior of the function y = sin(1/x). As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is very close to zero, the function is oscillating very rapidly, crossing the x-axis each time 1/x increases by \u03c0. So, each time x decreases by approximately \u03c0/(n^2), the function crosses zero again. But in terms of counting the number of zeros, it's equivalent to counting the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001), which we've already determined is 2865.\n\nSo, I think I've got it right. The number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) crosses the x-axis whenever 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Solving 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 gives n between approximately 319 and 3183, inclusive. Counting these integers yields 2865 intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let me recall that sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 is an integer multiple of \u03c0. That is, \u03b8 = k\u03c0, where k is any integer. So, in this case, \u03b8 is 1/x. Therefore, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = k\u03c0. \n\nSo, solving for x, we get x = 1/(k\u03c0). That means each x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(k\u03c0) for some integer k. Now, I need to find all such x that lie within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nLet me write that as inequalities:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nI can solve these inequalities for k to find the range of integers k that satisfy this condition. Let me start with the left inequality:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(k\u03c0)\n\nMultiplying both sides by k\u03c0 (since k is positive, I don't have to flip the inequality sign):\n\n0.0001 * k\u03c0 < 1\n\nDividing both sides by 0.0001:\n\nk\u03c0 < 1 / 0.0001\nk\u03c0 < 10000\n\nSo, k < 10000 / \u03c0\n\nCalculating 10000 / \u03c0, since \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so:\n\n10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618\n\nSo, k < approximately 3183.0988618. Since k must be an integer, the maximum possible k is 3183.\n\nNow, let's solve the right inequality:\n\n1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nAgain, multiply both sides by k\u03c0:\n\n1 < 0.001 * k\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by 0.001:\n\n1000 < k\u03c0\n\nSo, k > 1000 / \u03c0\n\nCalculating 1000 / \u03c0:\n\n1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618\n\nSo, k > approximately 318.30988618. Since k must be an integer, the smallest possible k is 319.\n\nWait, hold on, let me check that again. If k > 318.309..., then the smallest integer k is 319. That makes sense.\n\nSo, k starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. \n\nThe number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. But here, k starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nSo, there are 2865 integer values of k between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there should be 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFirst, solving for k in both inequalities:\n\nFor the lower bound, 0.0001 < 1/(k\u03c0):\n\nMultiply both sides by k\u03c0: 0.0001k\u03c0 < 1\n\nDivide by 0.0001: k\u03c0 < 10000\n\nSo, k < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so k_max = 3183.\n\nFor the upper bound, 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001:\n\nMultiply both sides by k\u03c0: 1 < 0.001k\u03c0\n\nDivide by 0.001: 1000 < k\u03c0\n\nSo, k > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so k_min = 319.\n\nNumber of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but I should also consider whether 1/(k\u03c0) is actually within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Let me check for k = 319 and k = 3183 to see if they fall within the interval.\n\nFor k = 319:\n\nx = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(319 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(1002.65) \u2248 0.00099735, which is approximately 0.000997, which is greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001, so it's within the interval.\n\nFor k = 3183:\n\nx = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000.00000015) \u2248 0.0001, which is just above 0.0001, so it's also within the interval.\n\nWait, actually, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, does that mean we exclude the endpoints? Hmm, that's a good point.\n\nSo, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, x = 1/(k\u03c0) must satisfy 0.0001 < 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nBut when k = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but it's actually slightly less than 0.0001 because 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001. Wait, no, 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but let me compute it more accurately.\n\nWait, \u03c0 \u2248 3.141592653589793.\n\nSo, 3183 * \u03c0 = 3183 * 3.141592653589793.\n\nLet me compute 3183 * 3.141592653589793.\n\nWell, 3183 * 3 = 9549\n\n3183 * 0.141592653589793 \u2248 Let's compute 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3\n\n3183 * 0.041592653589793 \u2248 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32\n\n3183 * 0.001592653589793 \u2248 Approximately 3183 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0928\n\nSo adding those up: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.0928 \u2248 450.7128\n\nSo total is 9549 + 450.7128 \u2248 9999.7128\n\nSo, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.7128, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.7128 \u2248 0.00010000286\n\nWait, that's actually slightly more than 0.0001, right? Because 1/10000 is exactly 0.0001, so 1/9999.7128 is approximately 0.00010000286, which is just a bit more than 0.0001.\n\nSo, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010000286, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nSimilarly, for k = 319, as I calculated earlier, x \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nSo, both k = 319 and k = 3183 give x values within the interval.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that 1/(3183\u03c0) was slightly less than 0.0001, but actually, it's slightly more. So, that's correct, so x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is just above 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nSimilarly, for k = 319, x is just below 0.001, so included.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is indeed 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did the subtraction correctly: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 is 2865. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes when counting integers, it's easy to make an off-by-one error, so let me check with a smaller example.\n\nSuppose I have k from 2 to 5 inclusive. How many numbers? 5 - 2 + 1 = 4, which are 2,3,4,5. That's correct.\n\nSo, applying the same logic, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again: the function y = sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a very small interval near zero, the function oscillates rapidly.\n\nEach time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the sine function completes a half-period, so each zero crossing is separated by a change of 1/x by \u03c0, which corresponds to x changing by approximately \u03c0/(x^2) dx, but maybe that's more calculus than needed.\n\nBut the key point is that each zero crossing occurs at x = 1/(k\u03c0), so the number of zeros is the number of integers k such that 1/(k\u03c0) is between 0.0001 and 0.001.\n\nWhich we've already found to be k from 319 to 3183, inclusive, giving 2865 zeros.\n\nWait, but let me check if I considered all possible k's correctly. For example, does k start at 1 and go up? Well, in this case, since x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a very small x, so 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000, so \u03b8 = 1/x is between 1000 and 10000 radians.\n\nNow, how many zeros does sin(\u03b8) have between \u03b8 = 1000 and \u03b8 = 10000?\n\nEach zero occurs at \u03b8 = k\u03c0, so the number of zeros is the number of integers k such that 1000 < k\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nSo, solving for k:\n\nk > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309...\n\nk < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098...\n\nSo, k ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. So, I'm confident that the answer is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = k\u03c0 for integer k. Solving for x gives x = 1/(k\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 0.0001 < 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for k, we find k ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let me recall that the sine function is zero at integer multiples of \u03c0. So, sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 = n\u03c0, where n is an integer. In this case, \u03b8 is 1/x, so I can set up the equation 1/x = n\u03c0. Solving for x, I get x = 1/(n\u03c0). \n\nNow, I need to find all the x values in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) that satisfy x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, I can write the inequalities 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. \n\nLet me solve for n in these inequalities. Starting with the left inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that reversing the inequality when taking reciprocals, I get 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Calculating 1/0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, I get n < 10000/\u03c0. \n\nSimilarly, for the right inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals again, n\u03c0 > 1/0.001. 1/0.001 is 1000, so n\u03c0 > 1000. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, n > 1000/\u03c0. \n\nSo now I have n > 1000/\u03c0 and n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values numerically to find the range of n. \n\nFirst, 1000 divided by \u03c0. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 1000/3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is 10000/3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. \n\nSince n has to be an integer, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618 and less than approximately 3183.0988618. So, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183. \n\nNow, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1. Wait, no, actually, since 319 is the first integer, and 3183 is the last, the count is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me calculate that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive. \n\nTherefore, there are 2865 values of n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Each of these x values corresponds to an x-intercept of the function y = sin(1/x). \n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the interval is (0.0001, 0.001). Since x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. \n\nSo, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0, so 1/x = n\u03c0, which gives x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, for x in (0.0001, 0.001), n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.30988618 < n < 3183.0988618. \n\nSo, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. Now, how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive? Let me compute 3183 - 319 + 1. 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that's correct. \n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that the number of integers between a and b is floor(b) - ceil(a) + 1. So, here, a is 318.30988618, so ceil(a) is 319. b is 3183.0988618, so floor(b) is 3183. Then, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that's consistent. \n\nSo, that seems right. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. \n\nBut wait, let me think again. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a very small interval near zero, the function oscillates a lot. Each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the sine function completes a full cycle and crosses zero. So, each zero crossing corresponds to an increase of \u03c0 in 1/x, which translates to a decrease of \u03c0/(x^2) in x, but I think I'm overcomplicating it. \n\nAlternatively, since 1/x goes from 1000 to 10000, the number of zeros should be approximately (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0, which is 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.19. But since n has to be an integer, it's either 2866 or 2865. But our calculation earlier gave 2865. Hmm, so why the slight discrepancy? \n\nWait, because when we take n from 319 to 3183 inclusive, that's 2865 numbers, but (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 is approximately 2866.19. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the exact count. Let me check again. \n\nWait, 1000/\u03c0 is approximately 318.30988618, so the first integer n is 319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 is approximately 3183.0988618, so the last integer n is 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more is 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 is 2865. So, that's correct. \n\nBut (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 is 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.19, which is about 2866. So, why is there a difference of 1? Because when we take n from 319 to 3183, we're including both endpoints, but perhaps one of them is exactly on 1000 or 10000, but since 1000/\u03c0 is not an integer, and 10000/\u03c0 is not an integer, so we don't include either endpoint. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n where n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000, which is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0) + 1. \n\nSo, floor(10000/\u03c0) is 3183, ceil(1000/\u03c0) is 319. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the number of zeros is equal to the number of times 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0 as x goes from 0.0001 to 0.001. So, when x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000. So, each time 1/x passes a multiple of \u03c0, we get a zero crossing. \n\nSo, the number of zero crossings is the number of multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. So, the first multiple above 1000 is \u03c0*319 \u2248 1000.000... something, and the last multiple below 10000 is \u03c0*3183 \u2248 10000.000... something. So, the number of multiples is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. \n\nWait, but if I think about it as the number of times 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0, it's the number of integers n such that n\u03c0 is in (1000, 10000). So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which is the same as 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.30988618 < n < 3183.0988618. So, n can be 319, 320, ..., 3183. \n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. \n\nWait, but another way to compute it is to take the floor of 10000/\u03c0, which is 3183, and subtract the ceiling of 1000/\u03c0, which is 319, and then add 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. \n\nSo, that's consistent. \n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. \n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial setup. The function is y = sin(1/x), and we're looking for x-intercepts in (0.0001, 0.001). So, x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which means 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. \n\nSo, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, x must be in (0.0001, 0.001), which means 1/(n\u03c0) must be in (0.0001, 0.001). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. \n\nTaking reciprocals, as I did before, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so n must be between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0. \n\nSo, n starts at the smallest integer greater than 1000/\u03c0, which is 319, and ends at the largest integer less than 10000/\u03c0, which is 3183. \n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. \n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. \n\nI think that's solid. I can't see any mistakes in the reasoning. So, the final answer is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0, i.e., x = 1/(n\u03c0). For x in (0.0001, 0.001), 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. Thus, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, leading to n between approximately 319 and 3183. The number of integers in this range is 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let me recall that sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 is an integer multiple of \u03c0. So, sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 = k\u03c0, where k is any integer. In this case, \u03b8 is 1/x, so I can set up the equation 1/x = k\u03c0. Solving for x, I get x = 1/(k\u03c0). So, every time x is equal to 1 divided by an integer multiple of \u03c0, the function y = sin(1/x) will cross the x-axis.\n\nNow, the interval given is from 0.0001 to 0.001. So, I need to find all x such that 0.0001 < x < 0.001 and x = 1/(k\u03c0) for some integer k. Let me write that down:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nI can solve this inequality for k to find the range of integers k that satisfy it.\n\nStarting with the left part of the inequality:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(k\u03c0)\n\nIf I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that flipping the inequality when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive, I get:\n\n1/0.0001 > k\u03c0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n10000 > k\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by \u03c0:\n\nk < 10000/\u03c0\n\nCalculating 10000 divided by \u03c0. Since \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so:\n\n10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618\n\nSo, k must be less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since k is an integer, the maximum possible k is 3183.\n\nNow, looking at the right part of the inequality:\n\n1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nAgain, taking reciprocals:\n\nk\u03c0 > 1/0.001\n\nWhich is:\n\nk\u03c0 > 1000\n\nDivide both sides by \u03c0:\n\nk > 1000/\u03c0\n\nCalculating 1000 divided by \u03c0:\n\n1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184\n\nSo, k must be greater than approximately 318.309886184. Since k is an integer, the smallest possible k is 319.\n\nSo, putting it all together, k must be an integer such that 319 \u2264 k \u2264 3183.\n\nNow, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers, I can subtract the smaller from the larger and add 1 (since both endpoints are included).\n\nNumber of integers = 3183 - 319 + 1\n\nCalculating that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\n2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nSo, there are 2865 integers k that satisfy the condition. Each of these k corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(k\u03c0) within the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618, so k must be less than that, so k_max is 3183. Correct.\n\nThen, 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so k must be greater than that, so k_min is 319. Correct.\n\nNow, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that again:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Yes, that seems right.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, let's consider a smaller example. Suppose I have numbers from 2 to 5 inclusive. The count is 5 - 2 + 1 = 4, which are 2,3,4,5. That works. So, yes, the formula is correct.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nBut hold on, let me think about whether each k in that range gives a unique x-intercept in the interval. Since x = 1/(k\u03c0), and as k increases, x decreases. So, when k increases by 1, x decreases. So, each k gives a unique x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, yes, each k corresponds to exactly one x-intercept in that interval.\n\nTherefore, the total number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check the endpoints. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, meaning it doesn't include the endpoints. So, I need to make sure that x = 1/(k\u03c0) is strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001.\n\nSo, let's check for k = 319:\n\nx = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(319 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(1002.65) \u2248 0.00099736, which is approximately 0.00099736, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval.\n\nFor k = 3183:\n\nx = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, but since the interval is open, 0.0001 is excluded. Wait, so does that mean that k = 3183 gives x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but it's excluded. So, we need to make sure that x is greater than 0.0001.\n\nWait, let's compute 1/(3183\u03c0) more accurately.\n\nFirst, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, 3183 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 approximately 5.06. So adding up: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.06 \u2248 450.68. So total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9549 + 450.68 \u2248 10,000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001.\n\nBut since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, x must be greater than 0.0001. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but is it greater than 0.0001?\n\nWait, 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10,000 because 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 10,000, but let's compute it more accurately.\n\nLet me use a calculator approach for better precision.\n\nCompute 3183 * \u03c0:\n\n\u03c0 \u2248 3.141592653589793\n\nSo, 3183 * 3.141592653589793\n\nLet me compute 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796077\n\nThen, 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.141592653589793 \u2248\n\nCompute 100 * \u03c0 \u2248 314.159265359\n\n80 * \u03c0 \u2248 251.327412287\n\n3 * \u03c0 \u2248 9.4247779608\n\nSo, 100 + 80 + 3 = 183\n\nSo, 314.159265359 + 251.327412287 \u2248 565.486677646 + 9.4247779608 \u2248 574.911455607\n\nSo, 183\u03c0 \u2248 574.911455607\n\nTherefore, 3183\u03c0 = 3000\u03c0 + 183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796077 + 574.911455607 \u2248 10,000. (Exactly, 9424.77796077 + 574.911455607 = 9999.689416377)\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.689416377, which is just a bit less than 10,000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.689416377 \u2248 approximately 0.000100003.\n\nWait, let me compute 1 divided by 9999.689416377.\n\nSince 1/10000 = 0.0001, and 9999.689416377 is slightly less than 10000, so 1/9999.689416377 is slightly more than 0.0001. Let me compute it:\n\nLet me denote N = 9999.689416377\n\nCompute 1/N:\n\nWe can write N = 10000 - 0.310583623\n\nSo, 1/N \u2248 (1/10000) * (1 / (1 - 0.0000310583623)) \u2248 (0.0001)(1 + 0.0000310583623) using the approximation 1/(1 - \u03b5) \u2248 1 + \u03b5 for small \u03b5.\n\nSo, 1/N \u2248 0.0001 + 0.0000000310583623 \u2248 0.00010000310583623\n\nSo, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010000310583623, which is just slightly above 0.0001.\n\nSince the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, x must be greater than 0.0001. So, 0.0001000031 is just barely above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval.\n\nSimilarly, for k = 319:\n\nx = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(319 * 3.141592653589793)\n\nCompute 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.141592653589793\n\nCompute 300 * \u03c0 \u2248 942.477796077\n\n19 * \u03c0 \u2248 59.690260418\n\nSo, total \u2248 942.477796077 + 59.690260418 \u2248 1002.168056495\n\nSo, 319\u03c0 \u2248 1002.168056495\n\nThus, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.168056495 \u2248 approximately 0.00099783\n\nWhich is approximately 0.00099783, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval.\n\nWait, but 0.00099783 is approximately 0.00099783, which is 0.00099783 < 0.001, so yes, it's included.\n\nBut wait, 0.00099783 is actually less than 0.001, so it's within the interval.\n\nWait, but 0.00099783 is 0.00099783, which is 0.00099783 \u2248 0.00099783, which is less than 0.001 by about 0.00000217, so it's definitely within the interval.\n\nTherefore, both k = 319 and k = 3183 give x values just inside the interval (0.0001, 0.001), so they are included.\n\nSo, the number of integers k from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check: 3183 - 319 = 2864, and 2864 + 1 = 2865. That's correct.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's compute 3183 - 319:\n\n3183 - 300 = 2883\n\n2883 - 19 = 2864\n\nSo, yes, 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 is 2865.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again: each k gives a unique x-intercept because each k corresponds to a unique x = 1/(k\u03c0), and as k increases, x decreases, so each k adds another oscillation, crossing the x-axis once each time. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is between 1/(3183\u03c0) and 1/(319\u03c0), the function y = sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times as x approaches 0, but in this case, we're only looking between 0.0001 and 0.001, which corresponds to k from 319 to 3183, each giving a unique x-intercept.\n\nSo, I think that's solid. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

    "text": " Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 is an integer multiple of \u03c0. That is, sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 = n\u03c0, where n is an integer. So, in this case, \u03b8 is 1/x. Therefore, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0. \n\nSo, if I solve for x, I get x = 1/(n\u03c0). Therefore, each x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n. Now, I need to find all such x that lie within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nLet me write that down: 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Substituting x = 1/(n\u03c0), this becomes 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nI can rewrite this inequality in terms of n. Let's start with the left part: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides (remembering that reversing inequalities when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive), I get 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. So, 10000 > n\u03c0. Therefore, n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nSimilarly, the right part of the inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals again, I get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0.\n\nNow, let me compute these numerical values to find the range of n.\n\nFirst, 10000 divided by \u03c0. Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n < approximately 3183.0988618.\n\nSimilarly, 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n > approximately 318.30988618.\n\nBut n has to be an integer. So, n must be greater than 318.309..., which means the smallest integer n is 319. Similarly, n must be less than 3183.098..., so the largest integer n is 3183.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me double-check that. If n must be greater than approximately 318.309, then the smallest integer n is 319. And since n must be less than approximately 3183.098, the largest integer n is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive.\n\nNow, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can compute 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me do that: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n in that range, which would correspond to 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait a second, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me think again. The x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer n, and we're looking for x between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, when x increases, 1/x decreases. So, as n increases, x decreases. So, the smallest x is 0.0001, which corresponds to the largest n, and the largest x is 0.001, which corresponds to the smallest n.\n\nWait, that might have confused me earlier. Let me check. If x = 1/(n\u03c0), then as n increases, x decreases. So, when x is 0.0001, n would be 1/(0.0001 * \u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, which is consistent with what I had before. Similarly, when x is 0.001, n would be 1/(0.001 * \u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183.\n\nBut wait, hold on. If n starts at 319, then x starts at 1/(319\u03c0), which is approximately 1/(1003.098), which is about 0.00099698, which is just under 0.001. Wait, but 0.00099698 is less than 0.001, so that's correct. Similarly, when n is 3183, x is 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.000), which is 0.0001 exactly. Wait, but our interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), so does that include x = 0.0001 or x = 0.001? No, it's open, so we don't include those endpoints.\n\nSo, does that mean that n starts at 319 and ends at 3183? Let me check x when n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.00099698, which is less than 0.001, so that's inside the interval. Similarly, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000099996, which is just above 0.0001, since 0.0001 is 1e-4, and 0.000099996 is 9.9996e-5, which is just below 0.0001. Wait, no, 0.0001 is 1e-4, which is 0.0001, and 0.000099996 is 9.9996e-5, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. Therefore, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's not included in our interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 would give x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000099996, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the largest n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000 - \u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000 - 3.1416) \u2248 1/9996.8584 \u2248 0.00010003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval.\n\nWait, let me compute 1/(3182\u03c0). Let me compute 3182 * \u03c0: 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, and 182 * \u03c0 \u2248 571.5832. So, adding them together: 9424.77796 + 571.5832 \u2248 10,000.36116. Therefore, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/10000.36116 \u2248 0.000099996, which is approximately 0.000099996, which is just below 0.0001, so it's not included. Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute more accurately. Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0. Let me compute 3000 * \u03c0 = 9424.77796, 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 574.745. So, 9424.77796 + 574.745 \u2248 10,000.52296. Therefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10000.52296 \u2248 0.0000999947, which is approximately 0.0000999947, which is less than 0.0001 (which is 0.0001 exactly). Therefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's not included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the maximum n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099996, which is just below 0.0001, so n=3182 gives x\u22480.000099996, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Wait, that can't be right because 1/(3182\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the maximum n where x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3181, perhaps.\n\nWait, let me compute 1/(3181\u03c0). Let's compute 3181 * \u03c0. 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 181 * \u03c0 \u2248 568.423. So, total is approximately 9424.77796 + 568.423 \u2248 10, 9424.77796 + 568.423 = 9993.20096. Therefore, 1/(3181\u03c0) \u2248 1/9993.20096 \u2248 0.000100068, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. Therefore, n=3181 gives x\u22480.000100068, which is within (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=3182 gives x\u22480.000099996, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded.\n\nSo, the maximum n is 3181, and the minimum n is 319, as before. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3181 inclusive. Now, let's compute the number of integers between 319 and 3181 inclusive.\n\nThe number of integers from a to b inclusive is given by b - a + 1. So, 3181 - 319 + 1 = 2863. So, there are 2863 integers from 319 to 3181 inclusive.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865, but that was before I realized that n=3183 gives x less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, the correct maximum n is 3181, so the count is 3181 - 319 + 1 = 2863.\n\nWait, let me confirm that calculation: 3181 - 319 = 2862, plus 1 is 2863. So, 2863 x-intercepts.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the range. Let me check with n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.098) \u2248 0.00099698, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. And n=3181: x=1/(3181\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100068, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. So, n ranges from 319 to 3181, inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3181 inclusive is 3181 - 319 + 1 = 2863.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Let me take a smaller example to make sure. Suppose I have numbers from 5 to 10 inclusive. How many numbers? 10 - 5 + 1 = 6. Which are 5,6,7,8,9,10: six numbers. So, yes, that formula works.\n\nSo, 3181 - 319 = 2862, plus 1 is 2863. So, 2863 x-intercepts.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the calculation of 3181 - 319. 3181 minus 300 is 2881, minus 19 more is 2862. So, yes, 2862, plus 1 is 2863.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0000999947, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3181, as we have.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2863.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when n increases, x decreases. So, n=319 gives x\u22480.00099698, which is just below 0.001, so it's included in (0.0001, 0.001). n=3181 gives x\u22480.000100068, which is just above 0.0001, so included. So, all n from 319 to 3181 inclusive give x in (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3181 - 319 + 1 = 2863.\n\nWait, but let me check if n=3181 is indeed the last n that gives x > 0.0001. Let me compute 1/(3181\u03c0) more accurately. Let me compute 3181 * \u03c0.\n\nUsing a calculator, 3181 * \u03c0 \u2248 3181 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 3000 * \u03c0 = 9424.77796, 181 * \u03c0 \u2248 568.423. So, 9424.77796 + 568.423 \u2248 9993.20096. Therefore, 1/9993.20096 \u2248 0.000100068, which is indeed greater than 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nSimilarly, n=3182: 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute 3000 * \u03c0 = 9424.77796, 182 * \u03c0 \u2248 571.583. So, total \u2248 9424.77796 + 571.583 \u2248 10,000.36096. Therefore, 1/10,000.36096 \u2248 0.000099996, which is less than 0.0001, so excluded.\n\nTherefore, n=3181 is the last n where x=1/(n\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. So, the number of x-intercepts is 3181 - 319 + 1 = 2863.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but that was before considering that n=3183 gives x less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, correct count is 2863.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when n=1, x=1/\u03c0\u22480.318, which is way larger than 0.001, so not in our interval. As n increases, x decreases. So, the first n where x=1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 is n where 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which is n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, n=319 is the first n where x < 0.001. Similarly, the last n where x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3181, as we saw. So, the number of n's is 3181 - 319 + 1 = 2863.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2863.\n\nBut wait, let me think once more: is there a possibility that between n=319 and n=3181, some x's might fall outside the interval? For example, does x=1/(n\u03c0) ever exceed 0.001 for n=319? Let's check: 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099698, which is less than 0.001, so included. Similarly, n=3181 gives x\u22480.000100068, which is just above 0.0001, so included. Therefore, all x's from n=319 to n=3181 are within (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the count is 2863.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. The function sin(1/x) has a period that changes as x approaches zero. The number of oscillations increases as x approaches zero. The distance between consecutive zeros of sin(1/x) is roughly proportional to 1/(n\u03c0), but I think in this case, each zero occurs at x=1/(n\u03c0), so the spacing between consecutive zeros is 1/(n\u03c0) - 1/((n+1)\u03c0) = (1/(n\u03c0)) - (1/((n+1)\u03c0)) = (n+1 - n)/(n(n+1)\u03c0) = 1/(n(n+1)\u03c0). But perhaps that's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since each zero occurs at x=1/(n\u03c0), and we're looking for x in (0.0001, 0.001), which is equivalent to n from 319 to 3181, inclusive, as we found, so the number of zeros is 3181 - 319 + 1 = 2863.\n\nWait, but let me check with n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099698, which is within (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=3181: x\u22480.000100068, which is within the interval. So, yes, all these x's are within the interval.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2863.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When n increases, x decreases, so as n increases, x approaches zero. But in our interval, x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, so n ranges from 319 to 3181, giving x from approximately 0.0001 to 0.001.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that n=319 is indeed the first n where x=1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me compute 1/(318\u03c0): 318 * \u03c0 \u2248 1000.000... Wait, 318 * \u03c0 \u2248 318 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 1000.000, exactly? Wait, 318 * \u03c0 is approximately 1000.000, so 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.001, which is the upper bound of our interval. But our interval is open, so x=0.001 is not included. Therefore, n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.001, which is excluded, so the first n where x < 0.001 is n=319, as we thought.\n\nSimilarly, n=3181 gives x=1/(3181\u03c0)\u22480.000100068, which is just above 0.0001, so included. So, yes, n ranges from 319 to 3181 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3181 - 319 + 1 = 2863.\n\nWait, but let me check: 3181 - 319 is 2862, plus 1 is 2863. So, 2863 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 1000/\u03c0\u2248318.309, so n starts at 319, and 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.098, so n ends at 3183, but since x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0000999947 is less than 0.0001, it's excluded, so the maximum n is 3181, as we saw. Therefore, the count is 3181 - 319 +1=2863.\n\nWait, but let me compute 3181 - 319: 3181 - 300=2881, 2881 -19=2862, plus 1=2863.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2863.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2863}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

Therefore, we solve the inequality:\n\\[ 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\]\n\nRewriting this in terms of \\( n \\):\n\\[ 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\implies n\\pi < 10000 \\implies n < \\frac{10000}{\\pi} \\approx 3183.098 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\implies n\\pi > 1000 \\implies n > \\frac{1000}{\\pi} \\approx 318.309 \\]\n\nThus, \\( n \\) must be an integer such that:\n\\[ 319 \\leq n \\leq 3183 \\]\n\nHowever, since \\( x \\) must be strictly greater than 0.0001, the largest \\( n \\) such that \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\) is still within the interval is 3181, because \\( \\frac{1}{3181\\pi} \\approx 0.000100068 \\) is just above 0.0001.\n\nTherefore, \\( n \\) ranges from 319 to 3181 inclusive. The number of integers in this range is:\n\\[ 3181 - 319 + 1 = 2863 \\]\n\nThus, the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts is \\(\\boxed{2863}\\)."

    "text": " Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that the sine function is zero at integer multiples of \u03c0. So, sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 = n\u03c0, where n is any integer. In this case, \u03b8 is 1/x. So, setting 1/x equal to n\u03c0 should give me the x-values where the function is zero.\n\nLet me write that down: 1/x = n\u03c0. Solving for x, I get x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, each x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n. Now, I need to find all such x that lie within the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nSo, I can set up inequalities to find the range of n that satisfies 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me write that out:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nI can solve each part of this inequality for n. Let's start with the left side:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0).\n\nMultiplying both sides by n\u03c0 (assuming n is positive, which it should be since x is positive in the interval), we get:\n\n0.0001 * n\u03c0 < 1.\n\nThen, dividing both sides by 0.0001\u03c0:\n\nn < 1 / (0.0001\u03c0).\n\nCalculating 1 / 0.0001 is 10000, so n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nSimilarly, for the right side of the inequality:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nMultiplying both sides by n\u03c0:\n\n1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0.\n\nDividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0:\n\n1 / (0.001\u03c0) < n.\n\nCalculating 1 / 0.001 is 1000, so n > 1000/\u03c0.\n\nNow, let me compute these numerical values to find the range for n.\n\nFirst, 10000 divided by \u03c0. Since \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, let me compute 10000 / 3.1415926535.\n\n10000 \u00f7 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618.\n\nSo, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n has to be an integer, the maximum integer n can be is 3183.\n\nNext, 1000 divided by \u03c0: 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.3098862.\n\nSo, n must be greater than approximately 318.3098862. Since n is an integer, the smallest integer n can be is 319.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 up to 3183, inclusive.\n\nNow, to find the number of integers in this range, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add one (since both endpoints are included).\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nLet me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot of x-intercepts. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, checking the inequalities:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nSo, solving for n:\n\nFrom 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0), we get n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618.\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, we get n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098862.\n\nSo, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nNumber of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\n3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me think about whether each n in that range actually corresponds to a unique x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), as n increases, x decreases. So, starting from n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0), which is approximately 1/(1003.0) \u2248 0.000997, which is just below 0.001. Then, as n increases, x gets smaller, approaching 0.0001 when n approaches 3183.\n\nWait, let me check x when n=3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001. But the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so does x=0.0001 count? No, because it's an open interval, so we exclude the endpoints. So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001.\n\nSo, let me check if x=1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001.\n\n1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001. But since 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000, because \u03c0 \u2248 3.1415926535, 3183*\u03c0 \u2248 3183*3.1415926535 \u2248 let me compute that:\n\n3183 * 3 = 9549.\n\n3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.14 \u2248 445.62, and 3183 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 \u22485.06.\n\nSo total is approximately 9549 + 445.62 + 5.06 \u2248 10,000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001.\n\nBut since 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10,000, 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001. Therefore, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is just below 0.0001, which is not in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, we need to exclude n=3183.\n\nSimilarly, let's check n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0). Since 3182\u03c0 is slightly less than 10,000, so 1/(3182\u03c0) is slightly more than 0.0001. So, x=1/(3182\u03c0) is just above 0.0001, so it is included in the interval.\n\nTherefore, the upper bound for n should be 3182 instead of 3183 because n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) which is less than 0.0001, so outside the interval. So, n goes up to 3182.\n\nSimilarly, let's check the lower bound. When n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0). Let me compute that.\n\n319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 319*3 = 957, 319*0.1415926535 \u2248 45.14. So total \u2248 957 + 45.14 \u2248 1002.14. So, x=1/1002.14 \u2248 0.0009978, which is just below 0.001. So, x=0.0009978 is in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), so n=319 is included.\n\nWait, but let me check n=318: x=1/(318\u03c0). 318\u03c0 \u2248 318*3.1415926535 \u2248 318*3=954, 318*0.1415926535\u224845.0. So, total \u2248 954 + 45.0 = 999. So, x=1/999 \u2248 0.001001, which is just above 0.001. So, x=0.001001 is outside the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=318 gives x=0.001001, which is excluded. So, the lower bound is n=319.\n\nSo, correcting the upper bound, n goes from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nNow, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\nLet me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 + 1 = 2864.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but after correcting the upper bound, it's 2864. Let me double-check.\n\nNumber of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure that n=3182 gives x=1/(3182\u03c0) which is just above 0.0001, as we saw earlier, so it's included. And n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0) \u22480.0009978, which is just below 0.001, so included.\n\nTherefore, the total number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. Between x=0.0001 and x=0.001, the function will oscillate a certain number of times. Each oscillation crosses the x-axis twice, except possibly at the endpoints.\n\nBut wait, actually, each full period of the sine function includes two x-intercepts. But in this case, since we're dealing with 1/x, the period isn't constant, but as x approaches zero, the function oscillates infinitely many times. However, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), the function will have a certain number of oscillations.\n\nAlternatively, we can think about the change in \u03b8 = 1/x. When x goes from 0.0001 to 0.001, \u03b8 goes from 10,000 to 1000. So, \u03b8 decreases from 10,000 to 1000. The sine function crosses zero each time \u03b8 passes a multiple of \u03c0. So, the number of zeros is the number of times \u03b8 passes through n\u03c0 as it goes from 10,000 to 1000.\n\nSo, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10,000.\n\nWait, no, actually \u03b8 goes from 10,000 to 1000, so \u03b8 decreases. So, the zeros occur at \u03b8 = n\u03c0 for n from some lower to some upper integer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many times \u03b8 crosses n\u03c0 as \u03b8 decreases from 10,000 to 1000.\n\nSo, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10,000.\n\nSolving for n:\n\nn > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098862,\n\nn < 10,000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nWait, but earlier I found that n should go up to 3182 because n=3183 gives \u03b8=3183\u03c0\u224810,000, which is the lower bound of \u03b8. But since \u03b8 starts at 10,000 and decreases, the first zero crossing would be at \u03b8=3183\u03c0, which is just below 10,000, so x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is the lower bound of x. Since x must be greater than 0.0001, we exclude n=3183.\n\nSimilarly, the last zero crossing within \u03b8=1000 would be at \u03b8=319\u03c0\u22481002.14, which is just above 1000, so x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009978, which is within the interval.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive, giving 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864 zeros.\n\nWait, but if I think in terms of \u03b8 going from 10,000 to 1000, the number of zero crossings is the number of integers n where \u03b8 crosses n\u03c0 in that interval. So, the number of n's where n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10,000.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10,000.\n\nThus, n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248318.3098862,\n\nand n < 10,000/\u03c0\u22483183.0988618.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nBut wait, when \u03b8=10,000, which is just above 3183\u03c0\u224810,000. So, \u03b8=10,000 is just above n=3183\u03c0, so the next zero crossing after \u03b8=10,000 would be at \u03b8=3184\u03c0, which is beyond 10,000. So, the zero crossings within \u03b8 from 10,000 down to 1000 are at \u03b8=3183\u03c0, 3182\u03c0, ..., down to \u03b8=319\u03c0.\n\nBut since \u03b8 starts at 10,000, which is just above 3183\u03c0, the first zero crossing is at \u03b8=3183\u03c0, which corresponds to x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is excluded because x must be greater than 0.0001. Therefore, the first included zero crossing is at \u03b8=3182\u03c0, corresponding to x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.0001001, which is just above 0.0001.\n\nSimilarly, the last zero crossing is at \u03b8=319\u03c0\u22481002.14, which is just above 1000, so x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009978, which is within the interval.\n\nTherefore, the number of zero crossings is the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nCalculating that: 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nSo, that confirms the earlier result.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought about the number of oscillations, I thought each oscillation has two zeros, but in reality, each zero crossing is a single point where the function crosses the x-axis. So, the number of zeros is equal to the number of times \u03b8 crosses an integer multiple of \u03c0 as \u03b8 decreases from 10,000 to 1000.\n\nSince \u03b8 starts just above 3183\u03c0 and decreases to just below 319\u03c0, the number of crossings is the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 between 319\u03c0 and 3183\u03c0, exclusive. So, that's 3183 - 319 = 2864 crossings.\n\nWait, but 3183 - 319 = 2864, but we have to include both endpoints, so it's 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. But earlier, we saw that n=3183 corresponds to x=0.0001, which is excluded, so we subtract 1, giving 2864.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me clarify.\n\nThe number of integer n such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3182 is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864.\n\nAlternatively, the number of integer n such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183 is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865, but since n=3183 corresponds to x=0.0001, which is excluded, we have 2864.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, considering the interval for \u03b8 is (1000, 10,000), the number of zeros is the number of integer n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 <10,000.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 <n <10,000/\u03c0.\n\nWhich is approximately 318.3098862 <n <3183.0988618.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, but since 3183\u03c0\u224810,000, which is the upper limit of \u03b8, but \u03b8 starts just above 10,000, so the first zero crossing is at n=3183, which corresponds to x=0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the valid n's are from 319 to 3182 inclusive, giving 3182 - 319 +1=2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me think about this differently. The function sin(1/x) has a period that changes with x. As x approaches zero, the period becomes smaller and smaller, leading to more oscillations. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), how many oscillations are there?\n\nThe change in 1/x from 1000 to 10,000 is 9000. The period of sin(1/x) is 2\u03c0/(1/(x^2))? Wait, no, the period T of sin(k/x) is 2\u03c0/(k/x) = 2\u03c0x/k. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, the number of zeros can be approximated by the difference in 1/x divided by \u03c0. So, the number of zeros is approximately (10,000 - 1000)/\u03c0 = 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.198. But since we're dealing with discrete zeros, we take the floor or something. But this is close to our earlier result of 2864.\n\nWait, but this method might not be exact. It's better to stick with the exact calculation.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial calculation when I included n=3183. I think the confusion arises because when \u03b8=10,000, which is just above 3183\u03c0, so the next zero crossing is at \u03b8=3183\u03c0, which is just below 10,000, so x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, n=3183 is excluded, so the maximum n is 3182.\n\nThus, the number of x-intercepts is 3182 - 319 +1=2864.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nSolving for n:\n\nn > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31 \u21d2 n \u2265 319\n\nn < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.10 \u21d2 n \u2264 3182\n\nNumber of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\n$\\boxed{2864}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let me recall that sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 is an integer multiple of \u03c0. That is, sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 = k\u03c0, where k is any integer. So, in this case, sin(1/x) = 0 implies that 1/x = k\u03c0. Therefore, x = 1/(k\u03c0). \n\nSo, the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(k\u03c0) for integer values of k. Now, I need to find all such x that lie in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nLet me write that down: 0.0001 < 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001. I can rewrite this inequality to solve for k. \n\nStarting with 0.0001 < 1/(k\u03c0), taking reciprocals on both sides (and remembering that reversing the inequality when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive), we get 1/0.0001 > k\u03c0. Which simplifies to 10000 > k\u03c0. So, k < 10000/\u03c0. \n\nSimilarly, from the other inequality: 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001, taking reciprocals again gives k\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, k > 1000/\u03c0. \n\nCalculating these numerical values: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. \n\nSo, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. \n\nAnd 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618.\n\nSince k has to be an integer, k must be greater than 318.30988618 and less than 3183.0988618. \n\nSo, k can take integer values from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. \n\nNow, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then add 1 (since both endpoints are included). \n\nWait, let me think: the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. \n\nSo, number of integers = 3183 - 319 + 1. \n\nCalculating that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then +1 is 2865. \n\nWait, let me double-check that subtraction: 3183 minus 300 is 2883, minus 19 more is 2864. So, yes, 2864 + 1 is 2865. \n\nTherefore, there are 2865 integer values of k between 319 and 3183, inclusive. Each of these k's corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(k\u03c0) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nWait, hold on a second. Let me make sure that x = 1/(k\u03c0) indeed lies within (0.0001, 0.001) for each of these k's. \n\nSo, when k = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.90) \u2248 0.000997, which is approximately 0.001, but wait, 0.000997 is less than 0.001, right? Wait, 0.000997 is 0.000997, which is 0.000997 < 0.001, correct. \n\nAnd when k = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.00) \u2248 0.0001, but wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 1/(10000) which is 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000, so x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001, but wait, the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001. \n\nWait, so if k = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000, x is slightly less than 0.0001. So, x would be less than 0.0001, which is outside the interval. \n\nWait, so maybe k should be less than or equal to 3182? Let me check. \n\nSo, 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies k < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, k can be up to 3183, but when k = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.00) = 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000, x is slightly less than 0.0001, which is not in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nTherefore, the maximum k that gives x > 0.0001 is k = 3182. Let me check: 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000 - something). Let me compute 3182 * \u03c0: 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 3182 * 3 = 9546, 3182 * 0.1416 \u2248 3182 * 0.1 = 318.2, 3182 * 0.04 = 127.28, 3182 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0912. So total \u2248 9546 + 318.2 + 127.28 + 5.0912 \u2248 9546 + 450.5712 \u2248 9996.5712. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.5712 \u2248 0.000100034, which is just slightly above 0.0001. So, x \u2248 0.000100034, which is indeed in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nSo, k can be from 319 to 3182 inclusive. \n\nSo, now, let's recalculate the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Using the formula: number of integers = 3182 - 319 + 1. \n\n3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 is 2864. \n\nWait, so earlier I thought k went up to 3183, but since k=3183 gives x just below 0.0001, which is outside the interval, so k should only go up to 3182. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's take k=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10000.00 \u2248 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000, x is slightly less than 0.0001, so indeed, it's not in the interval. \n\nSimilarly, k=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.90 \u2248 0.000997, which is approximately 0.001, but 0.000997 is less than 0.001, so it is included. \n\nWait, 0.000997 is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, k=319 is included. \n\nWait, but when k=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000997, which is 0.000997 < 0.001, so it's inside the interval. \n\nSo, the k's go from 319 up to 3182, inclusive. \n\nSo, number of terms is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. \n\nWait, but let me check with k=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100034, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. \n\nAnd k=319: x\u22480.000997, which is just below 0.001, so included. \n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. \n\nWait, but let me double-check the math: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. \n\nAlternatively, another way to calculate is: the number of integers between a and b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. \n\nSo, I think that's the answer. \n\nWait, but just to make sure, let's consider the endpoints. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. \n\nSo, when k=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since it's an open interval, x must be strictly greater than 0.0001, so k=3183 is excluded. Similarly, when k=318, x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.0) = 0.001, but again, since it's an open interval, x must be less than 0.001, so k=318 is excluded. \n\nWait, hold on, earlier I thought k starts at 319 because 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, so k must be greater than that, so the smallest integer k is 319. \n\nSimilarly, k must be less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618, so the largest integer k is 3183. But as we saw, k=3183 gives x just below 0.0001, which is excluded. So, the maximum k is 3182. \n\nWait, but let's check k=318: x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.0) = 0.001, but since the interval is open, x must be less than 0.001, so k=318 gives x=0.001, which is excluded. So, the smallest k is 319. \n\nSo, k ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. \n\nSo, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. \n\n3182 - 319 = 2863, +1 is 2864. \n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. \n\nWait, but let me check with k=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.90) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so included. \n\nAnd k=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100034, which is just above 0.0001, so included. \n\nSo, yes, 2864 intercepts. \n\nI think that's the answer. So, the number of x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in (0.0001, 0.001) is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at 1/x = k\u03c0 for integers k. Thus, x = 1/(k\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 0.0001 < 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for k gives 319 \u2264 k \u2264 3182. The number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 2864.\n\n\\boxed{2864}"

So, for our function, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0. Therefore, solving for x, we get x = 1/(n\u03c0). \n\nSo, the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer values of n. Now, I need to find all such x that lie within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). That means I need to find all integers n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nLet me write that inequality down:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nI can solve for n in this inequality. Let's start with the left part:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0)\n\nMultiplying both sides by n\u03c0 (since n is positive, I don't have to flip the inequality):\n\n0.0001 * n\u03c0 < 1\n\nThen, divide both sides by 0.0001\u03c0:\n\nn < 1 / (0.0001\u03c0)\n\nCalculating that, 1 / 0.0001 is 10000, so:\n\nn < 10000 / \u03c0\n\nSimilarly, for the right part of the inequality:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0:\n\n1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by 0.001\u03c0:\n\nn > 1 / (0.001\u03c0)\n\nCalculating that, 1 / 0.001 is 1000, so:\n\nn > 1000 / \u03c0\n\nSo now, n must satisfy:\n\n1000 / \u03c0 < n < 10000 / \u03c0\n\nNow, let's compute these numerical values to find the range of n.\n\nFirst, 1000 divided by \u03c0. Since \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, let me compute 1000 / \u03c0:\n\n1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184\n\nSimilarly, 10000 / \u03c0:\n\n10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184.\n\nBut n has to be an integer, so n must satisfy:\n\n319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183\n\nBecause 318.309886184 is just a bit more than 318, so the next integer is 319. Similarly, 3183.09886184 is just a bit more than 3183, so the largest integer n can be is 3183.\n\nNow, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can compute 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\nThen, 2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nSo, there are 2865 integers n such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Each of these n corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. When I compute the number of integers between a and b inclusive, it's b - a + 1. So, if a is 319 and b is 3183, then 3183 - 319 = 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me check with a smaller example to make sure. Suppose I have numbers from 2 to 5 inclusive. So, 2,3,4,5. That's 4 numbers. 5 - 2 = 3, 3 +1 = 4. Yep, that works. So, in this case, 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. That seems right.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me double-check the calculations.\n\nFirst, compute 1000 / \u03c0:\n\n1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184\n\nSo, n must be greater than this, so the smallest integer n is 319.\n\nSimilarly, 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, n must be less than this, so the largest integer n is 3183.\n\nThus, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1.\n\nCompute 3183 - 319:\n\n3183 - 300 = 2883\n\n2883 - 19 = 2864\n\nThen, 2864 +1 = 2865.\n\nSo, that's 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The interval given is (0.0001, 0.001). So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001.\n\nSo, x = 1/(n\u03c0) must satisfy 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nWhich is equivalent to 1/(0.001) < n\u03c0 < 1/(0.0001)\n\nSo, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nThen, dividing by \u03c0:\n\n1000 / \u03c0 < n < 10000 / \u03c0\n\nWhich is the same as before, so n must be from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check if 1/(319\u03c0) is indeed greater than 0.0001 and 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.001.\n\nCompute 1/(319\u03c0):\n\n1/(319 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(1002.7) \u2248 0.000997\n\nWhich is approximately 0.001, but wait, 0.000997 is less than 0.001, so 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000997 which is less than 0.001, but wait, our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.000997 is within the interval.\n\nWait, but 1/(318\u03c0) would be larger than 1/(319\u03c0), right? Because as n increases, 1/(n\u03c0) decreases.\n\nWait, no, actually, as n increases, 1/(n\u03c0) decreases. So, the smallest x-intercept is at n=319, which is 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000997, which is just less than 0.001. So, that's within the interval.\n\nSimilarly, the largest n is 3183, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0001) \u2248 0.0000999999, which is just above 0.0001, so that's also within the interval.\n\nWait, but 0.0000999999 is less than 0.0001, right? Wait, 0.0001 is 0.0001000000, so 0.0000999999 is just below 0.0001. So, that would be outside the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0000999999, which is less than 0.0001, so that's outside the interval. So, that x-intercept is not in the interval.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake here. Because when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0000999999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not in the interval. So, the largest n for which x=1/(n\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001 is when 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u22483183.09886184. So, the largest integer n is 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0000999999 <0.0001, so it's not in the interval. So, we need to find n such that 1/(n\u03c0) >0.0001, which would mean n < 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.09886184. So, the maximum integer n is 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0000999999 <0.0001, so it's not included. So, we need the largest n such that 1/(n\u03c0) >0.0001, which would be n= floor(10000/\u03c0)=3183, but since 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0000999999 <0.0001, we need to take n=3182 instead.\n\nWait, let me compute 1/(3182\u03c0):\n\n1/(3182 * 3.1415926535) \u22481/(10000 - 3182\u03c0\u224810000 -10000\u2248Wait, no, that's not right. Let me compute it properly.\n\nWait, 3182 * \u03c0 \u22483182 *3.1415926535\u2248Let me compute 3000*\u03c0\u22489424.77796, then 182*\u03c0\u2248571.584, so total\u22489424.77796+571.584\u224810,000 (approximately). Wait, actually, 3183 * \u03c0\u224810,000.0001, so 3182 * \u03c0\u224810,000.0001 - \u03c0\u224810,000.0001 -3.14159265\u22489996.8585.\n\nSo, 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22481/9996.8585\u22480.0001000314, which is just above 0.0001. So, 0.0001000314 >0.0001, so x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.0001000314 is within the interval (0.0001,0.001).\n\nSimilarly, 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22481/10000.0001\u22480.0000999999, which is just below 0.0001, so it's not included.\n\nTherefore, the maximum n is 3182, because n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0000999999 <0.0001, which is outside the interval.\n\nSimilarly, for the lower bound, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0\u2248318.309886184, so the smallest integer n is 319.\n\nTherefore, the range of n is from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nSo, now, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 -319 +1.\n\nCompute that:\n\n3182 -319 = 2863\n\n2863 +1 =2864\n\nSo, there are 2864 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 2865, but now I realize that n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0000999999 which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, the maximum n is 3182, giving x\u22480.0001000314, which is included. Therefore, the number of n's is from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that calculation.\n\n3182 -319=?\n\n3182 -300=2882\n\n2882 -19=2863\n\nThen, 2863 +1=2864.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but now it's 2864. So, which one is correct?\n\nLet me think again.\n\nThe initial approach was to find n such that 1000/\u03c0 <n <10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.309886184 <n <3183.09886184.\n\nSo, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183, but when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0000999999 <0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nTherefore, the correct number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with specific values.\n\nCompute n=319:\n\nx=1/(319\u03c0)\u22481/(1002.7)\u22480.000997, which is less than 0.001 and greater than 0.0001, so included.\n\nn=3182:\n\nx=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22481/(10000 - \u03c0)\u22481/(9996.8585)\u22480.0001000314, which is greater than 0.0001, so included.\n\nn=3183:\n\nx=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22481/(10000.0001)\u22480.0000999999, which is less than 0.0001, so excluded.\n\nTherefore, n runs from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but that was a mistake because I included n=3183, which gives x outside the interval. So, the correct number is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that n=3182 is included. Let me compute 1/(3182\u03c0):\n\nAs above, 3182 * \u03c0\u224810000 - \u03c0\u22489996.8585, so 1/9996.8585\u22480.0001000314, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nSimilarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.000997, which is within (0.0001,0.001).\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made a mistake in the initial calculation where I thought it was 2865. I think I forgot that n=3183 gives x outside the interval, so the correct count is 2864.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact values without approximations.\n\nLet me try to compute the exact bounds for n.\n\nWe have:\n\n0.0001 <1/(n\u03c0)<0.001\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n1/0.001 <n\u03c0<1/0.0001\n\nSo,\n\n1000 <n\u03c0<10000\n\nDividing by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 <n<10000/\u03c0\n\nCompute 1000/\u03c0:\n\n\u03c0\u22483.141592653589793\n\n1000/\u03c0\u2248318.30988618379065\n\n10000/\u03c0\u22483183.0988618379065\n\nSo, n must satisfy:\n\n318.30988618379065 <n<3183.0988618379065\n\nSince n must be an integer, n can take values from 319 up to 3183. But wait, when n=3183, 1/(n\u03c0)=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0000999999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nNumber of terms: 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another approach. The function y=sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. The number of zeros between a and b is roughly the number of times 1/x passes through multiples of \u03c0 as x decreases from b to a.\n\nSo, the number of zeros is approximately the difference in the number of multiples of \u03c0 between 1/b and 1/a.\n\nIn this case, a=0.0001 and b=0.001.\n\nSo, 1/a=10000 and 1/b=1000.\n\nThe number of zeros would be the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000.\n\nSo, the number of integers n such that 1000 <n\u03c0<10000.\n\nWhich is the same as n between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, as before.\n\nSo, the number of n is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0).\n\nCompute floor(10000/\u03c0)=floor(3183.0988618379065)=3183\n\nceil(1000/\u03c0)=ceil(318.30988618379065)=319\n\nSo, number of n=3183 -319=2864.\n\nWait, but that's 3183 -319=2864, but since we're counting inclusive, do we need to add 1?\n\nWait, no, because floor(10000/\u03c0)=3183, which is the maximum n, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0000999999 <0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nSo, the correct count is floor(10000/\u03c0) -1 - ceil(1000/\u03c0) +1= floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0).\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to compute the number of integers n where n >1000/\u03c0 and n <10000/\u03c0.\n\nSo, the number of integers is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0).\n\nWhich is 3183 -319=2864.\n\nYes, that matches our previous result.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I thought it was 2865, but upon realizing that n=3183 gives x outside the interval, I corrected it to 2864.\n\nSo, the final answer is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial subtraction.\n\n3182 -319 +1=?\n\n3182 -319=2863\n\n2863 +1=2864\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b -a +1.\n\nSo, from 319 to 3182 inclusive, it's 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n gives 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating these bounds, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\n\\boxed{2864}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by recalling that sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 is an integer multiple of \u03c0. So, sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 = n\u03c0, where n is an integer. In this case, \u03b8 is 1/x, so I can set up the equation 1/x = n\u03c0. Solving for x, I get x = 1/(n\u03c0). \n\nSo, the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer values of n. Now, I need to find all such x that lie in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). That means I need to find all integers n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nLet me write that inequality down: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. To find the range of n, I can solve for n in both parts of the inequality.\n\nStarting with the left part: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that reversing the inequality when taking reciprocals (since both sides are positive), I get 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Calculating 1/0.0001, that's 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, I get n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.14159265, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 10000 / 3.14159265 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.098.\n\nNow, the right part of the inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 / 3.14159265 \u2248 318.3098. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.3098.\n\nSince n has to be an integer, n must be greater than 318.3098, so the smallest integer n is 319. And n must be less than 3183.098, so the largest integer n is 3183.\n\nNow, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers, I can subtract the smaller from the larger and add 1. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that calculation. 3183 minus 319 is indeed 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in setting up the inequalities, let me check with specific values. Let's take n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0). Let's compute that. 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's see, 300*3.1416=942.48, 19*3.1416\u224859.69, so total \u2248 942.48 + 59.69 \u2248 1002.17. So, x \u2248 1/1002.17 \u2248 0.000998, which is approximately 0.001, but just slightly less. Wait, but 0.000998 is actually less than 0.001, so that's within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nNow, let's check n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0). 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's compute 3000*3.1416=9424.8, 183*3.1416\u2248575.35, so total \u2248 9424.8 + 575.35 \u2248 10,000.15. So, x \u2248 1/10,000.15 \u2248 0.0000999985, which is just slightly above 0.0001, so it's within the interval as well.\n\nWait, but 0.0000999985 is less than 0.0001, right? Because 0.0001 is 0.000100000, so 0.0000999985 is actually just below 0.0001. Hmm, that's a problem because our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, meaning it doesn't include the endpoints. So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001.\n\nSo, for n = 3183, x \u2248 0.0000999985, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included in the interval. Therefore, n = 3183 gives an x-intercept just outside the lower bound. So, maybe the maximum n is 3182 instead of 3183.\n\nWait, let me check that. Let's compute n = 3182: x = 1/(3182\u03c0). 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's compute 3000*3.1416=9424.8, 182*3.1416\u2248572.74, so total \u2248 9424.8 + 572.74 \u2248 10,000. So, x \u2248 1/10,000 = 0.0001 exactly. But since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so n = 3182 gives x = 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the next integer lower than 3183 is 3182, but that gives x = 0.0001, which is not included. So, the maximum n that gives x > 0.0001 is n = 3181.\n\nWait, let me compute that. For n = 3181: x = 1/(3181\u03c0). 3181 * \u03c0 \u2248 let's see, 3180 * \u03c0 \u2248 3180 * 3.1416 \u2248 3180 * 3 = 9540, 3180 * 0.1416 \u2248 3180 * 0.1 = 318, 3180 * 0.0416 \u2248 132. So, total \u2248 9540 + 318 + 132 \u2248 10,000. So, 3181 * \u03c0 \u2248 10,000 + \u03c0 \u2248 10,003.1416. So, x \u2248 1/10,003.1416 \u2248 0.000099969, which is less than 0.0001, so it's still excluded. Hmm, this seems like a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me approach this differently. Instead of approximating, maybe I can solve for n more accurately.\n\nStarting with the inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nLet me solve for n in each part.\n\nFirst, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001 \u21d2 n\u03c0 < 10000 \u21d2 n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886. So, n must be less than 3183.09886, so the maximum integer n is 3183.\n\nSecond, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u21d2 n\u03c0 > 1/0.001 \u21d2 n\u03c0 > 1000 \u21d2 n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886. So, the minimum integer n is 319.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nBut wait, when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999985, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. So, actually, n must be such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but as we saw, n = 3183 gives x just below 0.0001, which is excluded.\n\nTherefore, the maximum n that satisfies x > 0.0001 is n = 3183 - 1 = 3182? Wait, no, because n = 3183 gives x \u2248 0.0000999985 < 0.0001, so we need n such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but as n = 3183 gives x just below 0.0001, which is excluded, so the maximum n is 3182, but wait, let's check n = 3182: x = 1/(3182\u03c0). Let's compute 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.14159265 \u2248 let's compute 3000*3.14159265 = 9424.77795, 182*3.14159265 \u2248 182*3 = 546, 182*0.14159265 \u2248 25.76, so total \u2248 546 + 25.76 \u2248 571.76. So, total 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77795 + 571.76 \u2248 10,000. So, x \u2248 1/10,000 = 0.0001, which is exactly the lower bound, but the interval is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001. Therefore, n = 3182 gives x = 0.0001, which is excluded. So, the next lower n is 3181, but as we saw earlier, that gives x \u2248 0.000099969, which is still less than 0.0001. Wait, that can't be right because 1/(n\u03c0) increases as n decreases, so as n decreases, x increases. So, n = 3181 would give x = 1/(3181\u03c0), which is slightly larger than 1/(3182\u03c0), which was 0.0001. Wait, no, that's not correct because 3181 is less than 3182, so 1/(3181\u03c0) is larger than 1/(3182\u03c0). Wait, 3182\u03c0 is approximately 10,000, so 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but 3181\u03c0 is slightly less than 10,000, so 1/(3181\u03c0) is slightly more than 0.0001.\n\nWait, let me compute 3181 * \u03c0 more accurately. 3181 * \u03c0 \u2248 3181 * 3.14159265. Let's compute 3000*3.14159265 = 9424.77795, 181*3.14159265 \u2248 181*3 = 543, 181*0.14159265 \u2248 25.63, so total \u2248 543 + 25.63 \u2248 568.63. So, total 3181\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77795 + 568.63 \u2248 9993.408. Therefore, x \u2248 1/9993.408 \u2248 0.000100066, which is approximately 0.000100066, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval.\n\nWait, so n = 3181 gives x \u2248 0.000100066, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. So, n = 3181 is acceptable. Therefore, the maximum n is 3181, because n = 3182 gives x = 0.0001, which is excluded, and n = 3183 gives x \u2248 0.0000999985, which is excluded as well.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n = 3183 gives x \u2248 0.0000999985, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, the maximum n that gives x > 0.0001 is n = 3181, because n = 3182 gives x = 0.0001, which is excluded.\n\nWait, but let me check n = 3181: x \u2248 0.000100066, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included. So, n ranges from 319 to 3181 inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3181 inclusive is 3181 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3181 - 319 = 2862, plus 1 is 2863.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, let's recast the problem. The initial calculation was n from 319 to 3183, but n = 3183 gives x just below 0.0001, which is excluded, so the maximum n is 3181, giving x just above 0.0001. Therefore, the number of integers is 3181 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that: 3181 - 319 = 2862, plus 1 is 2863. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2863.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n goes up to 3183, but that gives x below 0.0001, which is excluded, so n must go up to 3181. Therefore, the correct count is 2863.\n\nWait, but let me check n = 3181: x \u2248 0.000100066, which is in the interval. So, n ranges from 319 to 3181 inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3181 - 319 + 1 = 2863.\n\nWait, but let me check n = 3182: x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 exactly, which is excluded, so n = 3182 is not included.\n\nSo, the count is from 319 to 3181 inclusive, which is 3181 - 319 + 1 = 2863.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought n went up to 3183, I got 2865. But that was incorrect because n = 3183 gives x below 0.0001, which is excluded. So, the correct count is 2863.\n\nWait, but let me double-check with n = 3181: 3181\u03c0 \u2248 9993.408, so x \u2248 1/9993.408 \u2248 0.000100066, which is indeed greater than 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nSimilarly, n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.17) \u2248 0.000998, which is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2863.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the calculation: 3181 - 319 = 2862, plus 1 is 2863. So, that's correct.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought n went up to 3183, I had 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865, but since n = 3183 and n = 3182 are excluded, the correct count is 2863.\n\nWait, but let me think again: n starts at 319 and goes up to 3181, inclusive. So, the number of terms is 3181 - 319 + 1.\n\n3181 - 319 = 2862, plus 1 is 2863.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let's take a smaller example. Suppose I have n from 2 to 5 inclusive. The numbers are 2,3,4,5. The count is 5 - 2 + 1 = 4, which is correct. Similarly, if n goes from 319 to 3181, the count is 3181 - 319 + 1 = 2863.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2863.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought n = 3183 gives x \u2248 0.0000999985, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, the maximum n is 3181, which gives x \u2248 0.000100066, which is included. Therefore, the count is 2863.\n\nWait, but let me check n = 3180: x = 1/(3180\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10,000.0003) \u2248 0.000099999997, which is less than 0.0001, so excluded. So, n = 3180 gives x below 0.0001, excluded. Therefore, n = 3181 is the first n that gives x > 0.0001.\n\nSimilarly, n = 319 gives x \u2248 0.000998, which is less than 0.001, so included.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2863.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because when I first calculated, I thought n went up to 3183, giving 2865 intercepts, but upon checking, n = 3183 gives x below 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, the correct count is 2863.\n\nBut let me think again: the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), open on both ends. So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001.\n\nSo, for x = 1/(n\u03c0), we need 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nWhich translates to:\n\n1/(0.001) < n\u03c0 < 1/(0.0001)\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nWhich is approximately:\n\n318.309886 < n < 3183.09886\n\nSo, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183, but we have to check whether n = 3183 gives x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999985, which is less than 0.0001, so excluded.\n\nSimilarly, n = 3182 gives x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 exactly, which is excluded.\n\nn = 3181 gives x \u2248 0.000100066, which is included.\n\nTherefore, the valid n's are from 319 to 3181 inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3181 - 319 + 1 = 2863.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2863.\n\nWait, but let me check n = 3181: 3181 * \u03c0 \u2248 3181 * 3.14159265 \u2248 let's compute accurately.\n\nCompute 3181 * \u03c0:\n\nFirst, 3000 * \u03c0 = 9424.77796077\n\nThen, 181 * \u03c0 \u2248 181 * 3.14159265 \u2248 let's compute:\n\n180 * \u03c0 \u2248 565.486677646\n\n1 * \u03c0 \u2248 3.14159265\n\nSo, 181 * \u03c0 \u2248 565.486677646 + 3.14159265 \u2248 568.628270296\n\nTherefore, total 3181 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796077 + 568.628270296 \u2248 10,000.00000000 approximately. Wait, that can't be right because 3181 * \u03c0 is slightly less than 10,000. Wait, no, 3181 * \u03c0 \u2248 10,000. So, 1/(3181\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but more accurately, it's 1/10,000.00000000 \u2248 0.0001, but actually, since 3181 * \u03c0 is slightly less than 10,000, 1/(3181\u03c0) is slightly more than 0.0001.\n\nWait, let me compute 3181 * \u03c0 more accurately.\n\nUsing a calculator, 3181 * \u03c0 \u2248 3181 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute:\n\n3181 * 3 = 9543\n\n3181 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 3181 * 0.1 = 318.1\n\n3181 * 0.0415926535 \u2248 let's compute 3181 * 0.04 = 127.24\n\n3181 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 approximately 3181 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0896\n\nSo, adding up: 318.1 + 127.24 = 445.34 + 5.0896 \u2248 450.4296\n\nSo, total 3181 * \u03c0 \u2248 9543 + 450.4296 \u2248 9993.4296\n\nTherefore, 1/(3181\u03c0) \u2248 1/9993.4296 \u2248 0.000100066, which is just over 0.0001, so included in the interval.\n\nSimilarly, n = 3182: 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute:\n\n3000 * \u03c0 = 9424.77796077\n\n182 * \u03c0 \u2248 182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 180\u03c0 \u2248 565.486677646 + 2\u03c0 \u2248 6.283185307 \u2248 571.769862953\n\nSo, total 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796077 + 571.769862953 \u2248 10,000.00000000 approximately.

    "text": " Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the sine function equals zero at integer multiples of \u03c0. So, sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 = n\u03c0, where n is an integer. In this case, \u03b8 is 1/x, so we can set up the equation 1/x = n\u03c0. Solving for x, that gives x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, each x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n.\n\nNow, the interval given is from 0.0001 to 0.001. I need to find all the x-values of the form 1/(n\u03c0) that lie within this interval. So, I can write the inequality 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me solve this inequality for n.\n\nStarting with the left part of the inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that taking reciprocals reverses the inequality, I get 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Calculating 1/0.0001, that's 10000. So, 10000 > n\u03c0, which means n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n must be less than or equal to 3183.\n\nNow, looking at the right part of the inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, which reverses the inequality, I get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001. Calculating 1/0.001 is 1000. So, n\u03c0 > 1000, which means n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Since n is an integer, n must be at least 319.\n\nSo, putting it together, n must be an integer such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the numbers, that's 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nLet me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n that satisfy the condition, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so n must be less than that, so the maximum integer n is 3183. Similarly, 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so the minimum integer n is 319. Now, subtracting 319 from 3183 gives 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct.\n\nJust to make sure, let me consider the endpoints. When n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0). Let me compute that: 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 1002.71, so 1/1002.71 \u2248 0.000997, which is just under 0.001, so that's within the interval. Similarly, when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000), which is 0.0001, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), it's open at 0.0001, so x = 0.0001 is not included. However, n = 3183 gives x \u2248 0.0001, but it's actually slightly less than 0.0001, so does that mean n can go up to 3183? Wait, let me check that.\n\nWait, if n = 3183, then x = 1/(3183\u03c0). Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0: 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let's compute 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, and 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 574.7014, so total is approximately 9424.77796 + 574.7014 \u2248 10,000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.0001, does x = 0.0001 count? No, because it's not included. So, n = 3183 gives x = 0.0001, which is not in the interval, so perhaps n should go up to 3182.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Let me check that again. If n = 3183, then x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but exactly, 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001. Wait, no, if 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, then 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, 3183 * 3.1415926535 is exactly 10,000.000000... something? Wait, no, 3183 * \u03c0 is approximately 10,000.000000, but actually, let's compute it more accurately.\n\nWait, 3183 * \u03c0: let me compute 3183 * 3.1415926535.\n\nFirst, 3000 * \u03c0 = 9424.77796077.\n\nThen, 183 * \u03c0: 180\u03c0 = 565.486677646, and 3\u03c0 = 9.4247779608, so 565.486677646 + 9.4247779608 \u2248 574.911455607.\n\nAdding to 9424.77796077 + 574.911455607 \u2248 9424.77796077 + 574.911455607 \u2248 9999.689416377.\n\nSo, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.689416377, which is just a bit less than 10,000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.689416377 \u2248 0.00010000313. Wait, that's actually just over 0.0001, because 1/10000 is 0.0001, and 1/9999.6894 is a bit more than that. Wait, that can't be right because 9999.6894 is less than 10,000, so 1/9999.6894 is greater than 0.0001.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me compute 1/9999.689416377.\n\nUsing a calculator, 1 divided by 9999.689416377 is approximately 0.00010000313, which is just a bit more than 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010000313, which is just over 0.0001. But our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.0001, so x must be greater than 0.0001. So, x = 0.00010000313 is just barely inside the interval. So, n = 3183 is acceptable because x is just over 0.0001.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but with more precise calculation, it's actually just over 0.0001. So, x is just barely inside the interval. So, n = 3183 is included.\n\nSimilarly, let me check n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.71) \u2248 0.00099726, which is less than 0.001, so that's within the interval.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when n increases, x decreases, right? Because as n increases, 1/(n\u03c0) decreases. So, the smallest x in the interval would be when n is largest, which is n = 3183, giving x \u2248 0.00010000313, just over 0.0001. So, that's included because the interval is open at 0.0001, so x must be greater than 0.0001. So, 0.00010000313 is greater than 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nSimilarly, the largest x in the interval is when n is smallest, which is n = 319, giving x \u2248 0.00099726, which is less than 0.001, so that's included.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Now, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another approach. The number of integers between a and b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, if a = 319 and b = 3183, then 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let's take a smaller example. Suppose I have n from 3 to 5 inclusive. Then, 5 - 3 = 2, plus 1 is 3, which is correct: 3,4,5 are three numbers. So, that formula works.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check once more. Let me compute 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so n must be less than or equal to 3183 because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.6894, which is less than 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010000313, which is just over 0.0001, so included. If I took n = 3184, then 3184\u03c0 \u2248 3184 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 10002.837, so 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099972, which is less than 0.0001, so not included in the interval. So, n can't be 3184, so the maximum n is 3183.\n\nSimilarly, for the lower bound, n must be at least 319 because n = 318 gives x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/1000. So, 318\u03c0 \u2248 1000, so 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.001, but the interval is up to 0.001, open at 0.001, so x must be less than 0.001. So, n = 318 would give x \u2248 0.001, which is not included, so n must be at least 319 to give x \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001.\n\nSo, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183, giving 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 intercepts.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

    "text": " Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 is an integer multiple of \u03c0. That is, sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 = k\u03c0, where k is any integer. So, if I set 1/x equal to k\u03c0, then x would be 1/(k\u03c0). So, the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(k\u03c0) for some integer k.\n\nNow, the interval given is (0.0001, 0.001). So, I need to find all integers k such that x = 1/(k\u03c0) lies within this interval. Let me write that down:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nI can solve this inequality for k. Let's start by taking reciprocals, but I have to remember that when I take reciprocals in inequalities, the direction of the inequality signs flips. So, let's do that step by step.\n\nFirst, let's take the left part of the inequality:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(k\u03c0)\n\nTaking reciprocals on both sides, we get:\n\n1/0.0001 > k\u03c0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n10000 > k\u03c0\n\nSimilarly, take the right part of the inequality:\n\n1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nTaking reciprocals:\n\nk\u03c0 > 1/0.001\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nk\u03c0 > 1000\n\nSo now, we have two inequalities:\n\nk\u03c0 < 10000 and k\u03c0 > 1000\n\nDividing both sides by \u03c0 to solve for k:\n\nk < 10000/\u03c0 and k > 1000/\u03c0\n\nCalculating the numerical values:\n\n\u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535.\n\nSo, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184\n\nSimilarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSince k must be an integer, k must satisfy:\n\n319 \u2264 k \u2264 3183\n\nWait, let me check that. Since k must be greater than approximately 318.309, the smallest integer k is 319. Similarly, k must be less than approximately 3183.098, so the largest integer k is 3183.\n\nNow, to find how many integers are between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1, but wait, let me make sure.\n\nWait, no. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, from 319 to 3183, it's 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\n2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, 3183 minus 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, so 2865 integers. That seems like a lot, but considering the interval is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a very small range, but since we're dealing with 1/x, the function oscillates very rapidly as x approaches 0. So, maybe it's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did the inequalities correctly. Because when I took reciprocals, I flipped the inequalities, right? So, from 0.0001 < 1/(k\u03c0), taking reciprocals gives 1/0.0001 > k\u03c0, which is 10000 > k\u03c0, correct. Similarly, 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001 implies k\u03c0 > 1000, correct. So, the k values must satisfy 1000 < k\u03c0 < 10000, which is equivalent to 1000/\u03c0 < k < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nSo, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so k must be greater than 318.309, so k starts at 319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so k must be less than 3183.098, so k ends at 3183. So, the number of integer k's is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nWait, 3183 - 319 is 2864, then +1 is 2865. So, 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because each k corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(k\u03c0). So, for each integer k from 319 to 3183, inclusive, we have an x-intercept in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, the number of such k's is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check if 1/(319\u03c0) is indeed greater than 0.0001 and 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.001.\n\nCalculating 1/(319\u03c0): 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.14159265 \u2248 let's compute that.\n\n319 * 3 = 957, 319 * 0.14159265 \u2248 319 * 0.1416 \u2248 45.1524. So total \u2248 957 + 45.1524 \u2248 1002.1524. So, 1/1002.1524 \u2248 0.0009978, which is approximately 0.0009978, which is greater than 0.0001, so yes, it's within the interval.\n\nSimilarly, 1/(3183\u03c0): 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265. Let's compute that:\n\n3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.14159265 \u2248 let's approximate:\n\n0.1 * 3183 = 318.3\n\n0.04159265 * 3183 \u2248 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, and 3183 * 0.00159265 \u2248 approx 5.08.\n\nSo total \u2248 318.3 + 127.32 + 5.08 \u2248 450.7.\n\nSo total \u03c0 * 3183 \u2248 9549 + 450.7 \u2248 10,000 (approx). So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10,000 = 0.0001, which is the lower bound of the interval. But since our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, x = 0.0001 is excluded, so k=3183 gives x\u22480.0001, which is excluded. So, does that mean that k can only go up to 3182?\n\nWait, let me check that more accurately. Let's compute 1/(3183\u03c0) precisely.\n\nSince 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute that:\n\n3183 * 3 = 9549\n\n3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3\n\n3183 * 0.04 = 127.32\n\n3183 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.001 = 3.183; 3183 * 0.0005926535 \u2248 approx 3183 * 0.0005 = 1.5915, and 3183 * 0.0000926535 \u2248 approx 0.295. So total \u2248 3.183 + 1.5915 + 0.295 \u2248 5.07.\n\nSo, 0.1415926535 * 3183 \u2248 318.3 + 127.32 + 5.07 \u2248 450.69.\n\nSo total \u03c0 * 3183 \u2248 9549 + 450.69 \u2248 10,000 (approx). So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but since our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, x must be greater than 0.0001. So, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, k=3183 would give x=0.0001, which is not included. So, the largest k we can have is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) would be slightly greater than 0.0001.\n\nWait, let me check that. Let's compute 3182 * \u03c0:\n\n3182 * 3 = 9546\n\n3182 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3182 * 0.1 = 318.2\n\n3182 * 0.04 = 127.28\n\n3182 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 3182 * 0.001 = 3.182; 3182 * 0.0005926535 \u2248 approx 3182 * 0.0005 = 1.591, and 3182 * 0.0000926535 \u2248 approx 0.295.\n\nSo, total \u2248 3.182 + 1.591 + 0.295 \u2248 5.068.\n\nSo, 0.1415926535 * 3182 \u2248 318.2 + 127.28 + 5.068 \u2248 450.548.\n\nSo, total \u03c0 * 3182 \u2248 9546 + 450.548 \u2248 10,000 - 0.452 \u2248 9999.548.\n\nSo, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.548 \u2248 0.0001000045, which is just slightly above 0.0001. So, 0.0001000045 is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, k=3182 is included, but k=3183 is excluded because it's exactly 0.0001, which is not included.\n\nSimilarly, let's check the lower end: k=319.\n\n1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.152) \u2248 0.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval. So, k=319 is valid.\n\nSo, now, the values of k start at 319 and go up to 3182. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that: 3182 - 319 = 2863; 2863 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 2865, but now it's 2864. Hmm, which is correct?\n\nWait, because when k starts at 319 and ends at 3182, the number of terms is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again.\n\n3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 is 2864. So, 2864 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation when I thought k went up to 3183.098, but since k must be less than that, the maximum integer k is 3183, but since 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded, so the maximum k is 3182. So, the number of k's is from 319 to 3182, which is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to make sure I'm not making a mistake.\n\nSuppose I have numbers from 5 to 8 inclusive. How many numbers? 8 - 5 + 1 = 4, which are 5,6,7,8. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, from 319 to 3182 inclusive, it's 3182 - 319 +1.\n\n3182 - 319 = 2863; 2863 +1=2864.\n\nSo, that would be 2864 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed 3183 - 319 +1, I got 2865, but that was when I included k=3183, which gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. So, the correct number is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me compute 3182 - 319 +1.\n\n3182 - 319: Let's compute 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 -19=2863. Then 2863 +1=2864.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check with k=319 and k=3182.\n\nAt k=319: x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009978, which is within (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nAt k=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.0001000045, which is just above 0.0001, so included.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation when I took k from 319 to 3183, which would be 3183 - 319 +1=2865, but since k=3183 is excluded, it's 2864.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again: the inequality is 0.0001 < x < 0.001, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001.\n\nSo, 1/(k\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001.\n\nSo, 0.0001 < 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\n1/0.001 < k\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000 < k\u03c0 < 10000\n\nSo, 1000/\u03c0 < k < 10000/\u03c0\n\nWhich is approximately:\n\n318.309886184 < k < 3183.09886184\n\nSo, k must be an integer greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, the smallest integer k is 319, and the largest integer k is 3183, but wait, 3183.09886184 is just a bit more than 3183, so 3183 is included because 3183 < 3183.09886184.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded because the interval is open. So, perhaps I made a mistake in that assumption.\n\nWait, let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0) more accurately.\n\nCompute 3183 * \u03c0:\n\n\u03c0 \u2248 3.141592653589793\n\n3183 * 3 = 9549\n\n3183 * 0.141592653589793 \u2248 Let's compute:\n\n0.1 * 3183 = 318.3\n\n0.04 * 3183 = 127.32\n\n0.001592653589793 * 3183 \u2248 Let's compute 3183 * 0.001 = 3.183\n\n3183 * 0.000592653589793 \u2248 3183 * 0.0005 = 1.5915\n\n3183 * 0.000092653589793 \u2248 approx 0.295\n\nSo, total \u2248 3.183 + 1.5915 + 0.295 \u2248 5.07\n\nSo, total 0.141592653589793 * 3183 \u2248 318.3 + 127.32 + 5.07 \u2248 450.69\n\nSo, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 9549 + 450.69 \u2248 10,000 - 0.31, so 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 10,000 - 0.31, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 + a small amount.\n\nWait, that would mean that 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001000031, which is just slightly above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, k=3183 would give x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001000031, which is within the interval, so it's included.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that 1/(3183\u03c0) was exactly 0.0001, but that's not correct. Because 3183 * \u03c0 is approximately 10,000 - 0.31, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001000031, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, k=3183 is included, so the number of k's is from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 +1.\n\nCompute that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\n2864 +1 = 2865\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that 1/(3183\u03c0) was exactly 0.0001, which would be excluded, but now I see that it's actually slightly more than 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nSo, the correct number is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with exact calculation.\n\nCompute 3183 * \u03c0:\n\n3183 * \u03c0 = 3183 * 3.141592653589793\n\nLet me compute this precisely:\n\n3183 * 3 = 9549\n\n3183 * 0.141592653589793\n\nCompute 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3\n\n3183 * 0.04 = 127.32\n\n3183 * 0.001592653589793\n\nCompute 3183 * 0.001 = 3.183\n\n3183 * 0.000592653589793 \u2248 3183 * 0.0005 = 1.5915\n\n3183 * 0.000092653589793 \u2248 0.295\n\nSo, total \u2248 3.183 + 1.5915 + 0.295 \u2248 5.0695\n\nSo, 0.141592653589793 * 3183 \u2248 318.3 + 127.32 + 5.0695 \u2248 450.6895\n\nSo, total 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 9549 + 450.6895 \u2248 10,000 - 0.3105 \u2248 9999.6895\n\nThus, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.6895 \u2248 0.0001000031, which is indeed greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nTherefore, k=3183 is included, so the number of k's is from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 10,000, which would make 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but that's not precise. The exact value is slightly less than 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly more than 0.0001, hence included.\n\nTherefore, the correct number is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check with k=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001000031, which is indeed in (0.0001, 0.001). So, yes, it's included.\n\nSimilarly, for k=319: x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so included.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2864, but that was a mistake because I incorrectly assumed that k=3183 was excluded, but in reality, it's included because 1/(3183\u03c0) is just above 0.0001.\n\nTherefore, the correct number is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nNumber of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a +1.\n\nSo, 3183 - 319 +1 = 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1=2865.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again: the function y=sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a small interval near zero, the function oscillates very rapidly. Each oscillation corresponds to a \u03c0 interval in the argument of the sine function. So, each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the sine function completes a half-period, leading to an x-intercept.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts can also be approximated by the difference in the values of 1/(x\u03c0) at the endpoints of the interval.\n\nWait, let me try that approach.\n\nAt x=0.0001, 1/(x\u03c0) = 1/(0.0001 * \u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nAt x=0.001, 1/(x\u03c0) = 1/(0.001 * \u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts would be the number of times the function crosses zero between these two values, which is the difference between these two numbers, approximately 3183.09886184 - 318.309886184 \u2248 2864.78897566\n\nSince each integer k corresponds to an x-intercept, the number of x-intercepts is approximately 2864.78897566, which we round down to 2864, but since the actual calculation using integer k's gives 2865, perhaps the exact count is 2865.\n\nWait, but the approximate calculation gives 2864.7889, which is almost 2865, so the exact number is 2865.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that this approach is accurate. Because the function y=sin(1/x) crosses zero each time 1/x passes through an integer multiple of \u03c0, so the number of zeros between x=a and x=b is the number of integers k such that 1/(k\u03c0) is between a and b.\n\nSo, in our case, a=0.0001, b=0.001.\n\nSo, the number of k's is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)).\n\nWait, 1/(a\u03c0) = 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u22483183.09886184\n\n1/(b\u03c0) = 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248318.309886184\n\nSo, floor(3183.09886184)=3183\n\nceil(318.309886184)=319\n\nSo, the number of k's is 3183 - 319 +1=2865\n\nYes, that's consistent with the earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the correct answer is 2865 x-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = k\u03c0 for integers k. We need to find the number of such k where x is in (0.0001, 0.001). Solving for k, we find k ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, giving 2865 x-intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let me recall that the sine function is zero at integer multiples of \u03c0. So, sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 = n\u03c0, where n is an integer. In this case, \u03b8 is 1/x, so I can set up the equation 1/x = n\u03c0. Solving for x, I get x = 1/(n\u03c0). \n\nSo, the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer values of n. Now, I need to find all such x that lie within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Let me write that down:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nI need to solve this inequality for n. Let me start by taking the reciprocal of all parts, remembering that taking reciprocals reverses the inequalities. So, I have:\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001.\n\nCalculating the reciprocals:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nNow, dividing each part by \u03c0 to solve for n:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nLet me compute these values. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So:\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184.\n\nSimilarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, n must be an integer strictly greater than 318.309886184 and strictly less than 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319, and the largest possible n is 3183.\n\nNow, I need to count how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers, I can subtract the smaller number from the larger one and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So:\n\nNumber of integers = 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864.\n\n2864 + 1 = 2865.\n\nSo, there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in that interval.\n\nWait, hold on a second. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 1000/\u03c0 is approximately 318.31, so the next integer is 319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 is approximately 3183.0988, so the largest integer less than that is 3183. So, from 319 to 3183 inclusive, how many integers? \n\nI can think of it as starting from 1 to 3183, which is 3183 numbers, and subtracting the numbers from 1 to 318, which is 318 numbers. So, 3183 - 318 = 2865. Yep, that matches. So, 2865 is correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me verify with another approach. The number of integers between a and b inclusive is given by floor(b) - ceil(a) + 1. In this case, a is approximately 318.31, so ceil(a) is 319. b is approximately 3183.0988, so floor(b) is 3183. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Yep, that's consistent.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each x-intercept corresponds to a zero crossing of sin(1/x). As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. However, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a small interval near zero, the function still oscillates a lot, but the number of oscillations is finite because the interval is bounded away from zero.\n\nEach oscillation of sin(1/x) corresponds to a change in 1/x by 2\u03c0, because the period of sin(\u03b8) is 2\u03c0. So, the number of zeros (x-intercepts) should be roughly the number of periods in the interval. Let me see if that aligns with my previous result.\n\nThe interval in terms of 1/x is from 1000 to 10000. So, the length in terms of \u03b8 = 1/x is 10000 - 1000 = 9000. Each period is 2\u03c0, so the number of periods is 9000 / (2\u03c0) \u2248 9000 / 6.28319 \u2248 1432.39. But wait, that's the number of periods, and each period has two zeros (one at the peak and one at the trough, but actually, each period has one zero crossing at the start and one at the end, but wait, actually, between each peak and trough, there are two zeros: one when going up and one when going down. Wait, no, actually, in the sine function, each period has two zeros: one at the start and one in the middle? Wait, no, sin(\u03b8) crosses zero at \u03b8 = 0, \u03c0, 2\u03c0, etc., so each zero is spaced by \u03c0. So, in the interval from \u03b8 = a to \u03b8 = b, the number of zeros is approximately (b - a)/\u03c0. \n\nSo, in this case, \u03b8 goes from 1000 to 10000, so the number of zeros is (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 = 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.19. Hmm, that's close to my previous count of 2865. The slight difference is because I'm counting the integer values of n, so it's either floor or ceiling. So, 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.19, which is approximately 2866, but since we're dealing with exact integer counts, it's 2865. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me check again. So, 10000 - 1000 = 9000. Divided by \u03c0, that's approximately 2866.19. So, the number of zeros should be approximately 2866. But since n must be an integer, and x = 1/(n\u03c0) must lie strictly between 0.0001 and 0.001, which corresponds to n strictly between 318.31 and 3183.0988. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. \n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct because 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. \n\nBut wait, if I think of it as (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.19, which is approximately 2866, but since the interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), does that affect the count? Let me think. The interval is open, so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001, but since 0.0001 is 10000 and 0.001 is 1000 in terms of \u03b8 = 1/x, so \u03b8 is in (1000, 10000). So, \u03b8 ranges from just above 1000 to just below 10000. So, the number of zeros would be the number of n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which is n from 319 to 3183. \n\nWait, but 3183\u03c0 is approximately 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 Let me compute that:\n\n3183 * 3 = 9549\n\n3183 * 0.1416 \u2248 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3\n\n3183 * 0.0416 \u2248 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, and 3183 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0928\n\nSo, adding those up: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.0928 \u2248 450.7128\n\nSo, total \u03b8 = 9549 + 450.7128 \u2248 9999.7128, which is just below 10000, as expected. So, \u03b8 = 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.7128, which is less than 10000, so n=3183 is included.\n\nSimilarly, n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.14159265 \u2248 Let's compute that:\n\n300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477\n\n19\u03c0 \u2248 59.690\n\nSo, total \u2248 942.477 + 59.690 \u2248 1002.167, which is just above 1000, so n=319 is included.\n\nSo, the count from n=319 to n=3183 inclusive is indeed 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the approximate number of zeros is 2866, but the exact count is 2865. The slight difference is because when I calculated (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0, I got approximately 2866.19, which is about 2866, but since we're dealing with integers, it's 2865. So, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each zero crossing corresponds to an increase in \u03b8 by \u03c0. So, the number of zero crossings is roughly the difference in \u03b8 divided by \u03c0. So, (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.19, which is about 2866. But since \u03b8 starts just above 1000 and ends just below 10000, the number of zero crossings is the number of times \u03b8 crosses multiples of \u03c0 in that interval, which is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0). \n\nCalculating floor(10000/\u03c0) = floor(3183.0988) = 3183\n\nceil(1000/\u03c0) = ceil(318.30988) = 319\n\nSo, 3183 - 319 = 2864, but since we include both endpoints, we add 1, getting 2865.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. For x in (0.0001, 0.001), we find n must satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183, yielding 2865 intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let me recall that sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 is an integer multiple of \u03c0. That is, \u03b8 = k\u03c0, where k is an integer. So, in this case, 1/x must be equal to k\u03c0. Therefore, solving for x, we get x = 1/(k\u03c0). \n\nNow, the interval given is (0.0001, 0.001). So, I need to find all x such that 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(k\u03c0), I can substitute this into the inequality to find the range of k.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nI can rewrite this inequality to solve for k. Let's take the reciprocals, remembering that this will reverse the inequalities because all terms are positive.\n\nSo, taking reciprocals:\n\n1/0.001 < k\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nCalculating those values:\n\n1/0.001 = 1000\n1/0.0001 = 10000\n\nSo, substituting back:\n\n1000 < k\u03c0 < 10000\n\nNow, to solve for k, I'll divide all parts by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < k < 10000/\u03c0\n\nLet me compute these values numerically. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535.\n\nCalculating 1000/\u03c0:\n\n1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184\n\nAnd 10000/\u03c0:\n\n10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, k must be an integer strictly greater than approximately 318.309886184 and strictly less than approximately 3183.09886184.\n\nBut wait, k has to be an integer, so the smallest integer k can be is 319 (since 318.309... is just above 318, so the next integer is 319), and the largest integer k can be is 3183 (since 3183.098... is just below 3184, so the integer part is 3183).\n\nNow, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, no, actually, it's from 319 to 3183, so the number of integers is (3183 - 319) + 1.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\nThen, 2864 + 1 = 2865.\n\nSo, there are 2865 integers k in that range, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts in the given interval.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my reasoning. Because when I took reciprocals, I had to reverse the inequalities, which I did correctly. Then, I correctly calculated 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which are approximately 318.31 and 3183.098. So, k must be integers from 319 up to 3183, inclusive.\n\nTo confirm the number of integers, let's think about it differently. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if 1/(319\u03c0) is indeed greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. Let's compute 1/(319\u03c0):\n\n1/(319 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(1002.772) \u2248 0.0009972, which is approximately 0.0009972, which is less than 0.001 and greater than 0.0001. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000.0000003) \u2248 0.0001, but slightly less than 0.0001, right? Wait, because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.0000003, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999996, which is just below 0.0001. Hmm, but our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999996, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included in the interval. Therefore, the maximum k is actually 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) would be just above 0.0001.\n\nWait, hold on, this is a crucial point. Let me recast this.\n\nWe have x = 1/(k\u03c0) must satisfy 0.0001 < x < 0.001.\n\nSo, 0.0001 < 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nWhich implies:\n\n1/(0.001) < k\u03c0 < 1/(0.0001)\n\nSo, 1000 < k\u03c0 < 10000\n\nThus, 1000/\u03c0 < k < 10000/\u03c0\n\nAs I calculated earlier, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184\n\n10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, k must be integers strictly greater than 318.309886184 and strictly less than 3183.09886184.\n\nTherefore, the smallest integer k is 319, and the largest integer k is 3183.\n\nBut wait, when k = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999996, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, actually, the maximum k should be such that 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001.\n\nSo, let's solve 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001\n\nWhich implies k\u03c0 < 10000\n\nBut we already have k < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so the maximum integer k is 3183, but as we saw, 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so we need to find the smallest k such that 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001.\n\nWait, that's not correct. Let me clarify.\n\nWe have x = 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001\n\nSo, 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001\n\nWhich implies k\u03c0 < 10000\n\nSo, k < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, the maximum integer k is 3183, but as we saw, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999996 < 0.0001, so it's not in the interval. Therefore, the maximum k for which x = 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001 is when 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001, which is equivalent to k < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nBut since k must be an integer, the maximum k is floor(10000/\u03c0 - \u03b5), where \u03b5 is a small positive number. Wait, but 10000/\u03c0 is approximately 3183.09886184, so the integer part is 3183. But since 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, we need the next lower integer, which is 3182.\n\nWait, let's compute 1/(3182\u03c0):\n\n3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3182 * 3 = 9546\n\n3182 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3182 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 3182 * 0.1 = 318.2\n\n3182 * 0.0415926535 \u2248 3182 * 0.04 = 127.28\n\n3182 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 approximately 5.06\n\nAdding those up: 318.2 + 127.28 = 445.48 + 5.06 \u2248 450.54\n\nSo total \u2248 9546 + 450.54 \u2248 9996.54\n\nSo, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9996.54\n\nTherefore, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.54 \u2248 0.0001000345, which is just above 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000345, which is within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, k can be 3182.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought k can be up to 3183, but that gives x \u2248 0.00009999996, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum k is 3182.\n\nSimilarly, the minimum k is 319, as 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009972, which is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nTherefore, the values of k run from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nNow, let's compute the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nThe formula is (last - first) + 1.\n\nSo, 3182 - 319 = 2863\n\nThen, 2863 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier calculation where I had 2865. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let's see: If k starts at 319 and ends at 3182, then the number of terms is 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\n3182 - 319 = 2863\n\n2863 + 1 = 2864.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 2865 because I included up to 3183, but since 3183 is excluded, it's actually 2864.\n\nWait, but let's make sure.\n\nLet me take a smaller example to check. Suppose I have integers from 2 to 5 inclusive. The numbers are 2,3,4,5. So, 5-2=3, plus 1 is 4 numbers, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, from 319 to 3182 inclusive: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864.\n\nTherefore, the correct number is 2864.\n\nBut wait, let me check again with the initial calculation.\n\nWe had 1000 < k\u03c0 < 10000\n\nSo, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 < k < 3183.09886184\n\nSo, k must be integers from 319 to 3183, but as we saw, k=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00009999996 <0.0001, which is excluded. So, the maximum k is 3182.\n\nTherefore, the number of k's is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that the number of zeros is equal to the number of times 1/x crosses each multiple of \u03c0 as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001.\n\nEach time x passes 1/(k\u03c0), the sine function crosses zero. So, the number of zeros is equal to the number of integers k such that 1/(k\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWhich is the same as k in (1000/\u03c0, 10000/\u03c0), which is approximately (318.31, 3183.098).\n\nSo, k must be integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with exact values.\n\nCompute 1000/\u03c0:\n\n\u03c0 \u2248 3.141592653589793\n\n1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618379065\n\nSo, the smallest integer k is 319.\n\nSimilarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098861837907\n\nSo, the largest integer k is 3183, but as we saw, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999996 <0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the largest k is 3182.\n\nSo, the number of k's is from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me think about it differently. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches zero. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is quite close to zero, the function oscillates very rapidly.\n\nEach oscillation corresponds to a period of 2\u03c0 in the argument of the sine function. So, the number of oscillations is roughly the change in 1/x divided by 2\u03c0.\n\nSo, the change in 1/x from x=0.001 to x=0.0001 is 1/0.0001 - 1/0.001 = 10000 - 1000 = 9000.\n\nTherefore, the number of oscillations is 9000 / (2\u03c0) \u2248 9000 / 6.283185307 \u2248 1432.393.\n\nBut each oscillation has two zeros (except possibly the first and last), so the number of zeros would be approximately twice that, which is around 2864.786.\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a zero, we take the integer part, which is 2864. That matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, this method also gives us 2864 zeros.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = k\u03c0 for integers k. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), we find the range of k such that 0.0001 < 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001, leading to k from 319 to 3182. The number of integers in this range is 2864.\n\n$\\boxed{2864}$"

In this case, \u03b8 is 1/x, so setting that equal to k\u03c0 gives me 1/x = k\u03c0. Solving for x, I get x = 1/(k\u03c0). \n\nSo, each x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(k\u03c0) for some integer k. Now, I need to find all such x that lie within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). That means I need to find all integers k such that 0.0001 < 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001. \n\nLet me write that inequality down: 0.0001 < 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001. To find the range of k, I can take reciprocals, remembering that taking reciprocals reverses inequalities. So, flipping all parts, I get 1/0.001 < k\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. \n\nCalculating those reciprocals: 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, the inequality becomes 1000 < k\u03c0 < 10000. Now, to solve for k, I can divide all parts by \u03c0. \n\nSo, 1000/\u03c0 < k < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute those values. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926536. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 1000 / 3.1415926536 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 / \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926536 \u2248 3183.09886184. \n\nSince k has to be an integer, k must be greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184. So, the smallest integer k can be is 319, and the largest integer k can be is 3183. \n\nNow, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers, I can subtract the smaller number from the larger one and add 1. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. \n\nCalculating that: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives me 2865. So, there are 2865 integers k in that range, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the x-intercepts are at x = 1/(k\u03c0), and we're looking for x between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, 1/(k\u03c0) has to be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. \n\nSo, 0.0001 < 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001, which leads to 1/0.001 < k\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < k\u03c0 < 10000, so k is between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0. \n\nCalculating 1000/\u03c0 gives approximately 318.31, so the next integer is 319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 is about 3183.098, so the largest integer k is 3183. \n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. \n\nWait, another way to check: the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct. \n\nI think that's the answer. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at 1/x = k\u03c0 for integers k. Solving for x gives x = 1/(k\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 1000 < k\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing by \u03c0, we find k ranges from 319 to 3183.

So, if I set 1/x equal to k\u03c0, where k is an integer, then sin(1/x) will be zero. That gives me x = 1/(k\u03c0). So, every x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(k\u03c0) for some integer k. \n\nNow, the interval I'm looking at is from 0.0001 to 0.001. Let me write that down as 0.0001 < x < 0.001. I need to find all the x-values in this interval that can be expressed as 1/(k\u03c0). So, substituting x = 1/(k\u03c0) into the inequality, I get 0.0001 < 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001. \n\nHmm, let me solve for k here. Let's start with the left part of the inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(k\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that flipping inequalities when taking reciprocals reverses them, I get 1/0.0001 > k\u03c0. So, 10000 > k\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, I get k < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 3183.0988618. So, k must be less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since k is an integer, the maximum value k can take is 3183.\n\nNow, let's look at the right side of the inequality: 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, we get k\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, k > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 318.30988618. So, k must be greater than approximately 318.30988618. Since k is an integer, the smallest value k can take is 319.\n\nSo, k ranges from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. To find the number of integers from a to b inclusive, it's b - a + 1. So, plugging in the numbers: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers in this range.\n\nWait, hold on a second. Let me double-check my calculations. So, 3183 minus 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more, which is 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in interpreting the interval. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, meaning it doesn't include the endpoints. So, I should check if x = 1/(k\u03c0) equals exactly 0.0001 or 0.001 for some integer k. If it does, then those k's shouldn't be included.\n\nSo, let's see if 1/(k\u03c0) equals 0.0001. That would mean k = 1/(0.0001 * \u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. Since k has to be an integer, the closest integer is 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.00009999, which is just under 0.0001, so it's not equal. Similarly, for 0.001, 1/(k\u03c0) = 0.001 implies k = 1/(0.001 * \u03c0) \u2248 318.30988618, so k would be 319, but 1/(319\u03c0) is approximately 0.0009995, which is just under 0.001. So, neither endpoint is actually achieved by x = 1/(k\u03c0), which means all the k's from 319 to 3183 inclusive are valid, and their corresponding x-values lie strictly within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is indeed 2865. \n\nWait, just to make sure, let me think about the behavior of sin(1/x) near the interval. As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x goes to infinity, and sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. So, between x = 0.0001 and x = 0.001, which is a small interval near zero, sin(1/x) will oscillate a lot, crossing the x-axis each time 1/x increases by \u03c0. So, the number of zeros should correspond to how many multiples of \u03c0 fit into the interval [1/0.001, 1/0.0001], which is [1000, 10000]. \n\nThe number of zeros would then be the number of times 1/x crosses each multiple of \u03c0 in that interval. So, the number of zeros is equal to the number of integers k such that 1000 < k\u03c0 < 10000. Which is exactly what I calculated earlier, leading to k from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 zeros. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 2865 x-intercepts in that interval.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = k\u03c0 for integer k. Solving for x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) gives k ranging from 319 to 3183, resulting in 2865 x-intercepts.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

So, sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 = k\u03c0, where k is any integer. So, if I set 1/x equal to k\u03c0, then x = 1/(k\u03c0). Therefore, the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(k\u03c0) for some integer k.\n\nNow, I need to find all such x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, I can write this as 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(k\u03c0), I can substitute that in to find the range of k.\n\nSo, substituting x = 1/(k\u03c0), the inequality becomes:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nI can solve this inequality for k. Let me do that step by step.\n\nFirst, let's solve 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001.\n\n1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001\n\nTaking reciprocals on both sides (and remembering that flipping inequalities when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive):\n\nk\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nCalculating 1/0.0001 is 10000, so:\n\nk\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing both sides by \u03c0:\n\nk < 10000/\u03c0\n\nSimilarly, solving the other inequality:\n\n1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nAgain, take reciprocals:\n\nk\u03c0 > 1/0.001\n\n1/0.001 is 1000, so:\n\nk\u03c0 > 1000\n\nDivide both sides by \u03c0:\n\nk > 1000/\u03c0\n\nSo, combining both inequalities, we have:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < k < 10000/\u03c0\n\nNow, since k must be an integer, I can find the number of integers k in this interval.\n\nFirst, let me compute 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0 numerically.\n\nI know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535.\n\nSo, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184\n\nSimilarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, k must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184.\n\nSince k must be an integer, the smallest integer k can be is 319, and the largest integer k can be is 3183.\n\nNow, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can compute 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\n2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nSo, there are 2865 integers k between 319 and 3183 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, 1000/\u03c0 is approximately 318.31, so the next integer is 319, correct.\n\nSimilarly, 10000/\u03c0 is approximately 3183.098, so the largest integer less than that is 3183, correct.\n\nThen, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\n3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865.\n\nHmm, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me think about whether all these k's correspond to distinct x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Since each k gives a unique x = 1/(k\u03c0), and since k increases, x decreases as k increases. So, as k goes from 319 to 3183, x goes from 1/(319\u03c0) down to 1/(3183\u03c0).\n\nLet me check if 1/(319\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001 and 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.001.\n\nCalculating 1/(319\u03c0):\n\n1/(319 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(1002.000) \u2248 0.000998, which is approximately 0.001, but wait, 0.000998 is actually less than 0.001, right?\n\nWait, that can't be because 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000998, which is less than 0.001, but we wanted x > 0.0001.\n\nWait, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000998, which is greater than 0.0001, right? Because 0.000998 is 0.000998, which is 9.98 x 10^-4, which is greater than 0.0001 (which is 1 x 10^-4).\n\nWait, no, 0.0001 is 1 x 10^-4, and 0.000998 is 9.98 x 10^-4, which is indeed greater than 0.0001. So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000998, which is within (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nSimilarly, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000\u03c0) \u2248 0.00003183, which is less than 0.0001. Wait, that's a problem because we need x > 0.0001.\n\nWait, that can't be right. So, if k = 3183, then x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000\u03c0) \u2248 0.00003183, which is less than 0.0001. So, that x is not in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, my previous calculation might be incorrect.\n\nWait, so perhaps I made a mistake in determining the upper bound for k.\n\nLet me go back.\n\nWe have x = 1/(k\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001.\n\nSo, 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001\n\nWhich implies k\u03c0 < 10000\n\nSo, k < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, the maximum integer k is 3183, as I had before.\n\nBut when k = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000\u03c0) \u2248 0.00003183, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not in the interval. Therefore, I need to adjust the upper bound for k so that x = 1/(k\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001.\n\nWait, so perhaps the upper bound for k is not 3183, but a lower integer.\n\nWait, let me solve for k such that 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001.\n\nSo, 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001\n\nWhich implies k < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nBut we also need x < 0.001, so 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001, which implies k > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184\n\nSo, k must be greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184.\n\nBut when k = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00003183, which is less than 0.0001, so that's not acceptable.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to find the smallest k such that 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001, which is k > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so k starts at 319.\n\nBut I also need 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001, which implies k < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184.

So, perhaps the maximum k is 3182.\n\nWait, let's check k = 3182:\n\nx = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000 - \u03c0) \u2248 approximately 1/9999.056 \u2248 0.000100009, which is just over 0.0001, so it's acceptable.\n\nWait, so 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100009, which is greater than 0.0001, so that's acceptable.\n\nSimilarly, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00003183, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the maximum k is 3182.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought k < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so the maximum integer k is 3183, but that gives x too small. So, perhaps I need to find the maximum k such that 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001.\n\nSo, solving for k:\n\n1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001\n\nk < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, k must be less than 3183.09886184, so the maximum integer k is 3183, but as we saw, k=3183 gives x \u2248 0.00003183 < 0.0001, which is not acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the maximum k is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100009 > 0.0001.\n\nWait, let me compute 1/(3182\u03c0) more accurately.\n\nCompute 3182 * \u03c0:\n\n3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535\n\nLet me compute 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796\n\n182 * \u03c0 \u2248 182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 571.0282\n\nSo, total \u2248 9424.77796 + 571.0282 \u2248 10,000.00616\n\nSo, 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 10,000.00616\n\nTherefore, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/10,000.00616 \u2248 0.000099999938, which is approximately 0.000099999938, which is just under 0.0001.\n\nWait, that's less than 0.0001, so that's not acceptable.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier thought. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated.\n\nWait, 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535\n\nLet me compute 3182 * 3.1415926535 step by step.\n\nFirst, 3000 * 3.1415926535 = 9424.77796\n\nThen, 182 * 3.1415926535:\n\nCompute 100 * 3.1415926535 = 314.15926535\n\n80 * 3.1415926535 = 251.32741228\n\n2 * 3.1415926535 = 6.283185307\n\nSo, 314.15926535 + 251.32741228 = 565.48667763\n\nPlus 6.283185307 = 571.76986294\n\nSo, total 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796 + 571.76986294 \u2248 10,000.547823\n\nWait, that's 10,000.547823, so 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/10,000.547823 \u2248 0.0000999945, which is approximately 0.0000999945, which is less than 0.0001.\n\nSo, that's still less than 0.0001, so x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999945 < 0.0001, so it's not in the interval.\n\nSo, that means even k=3182 gives x less than 0.0001, which is not acceptable.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to find the smallest k such that 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001.\n\nSo, solving for k:\n\n1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001\n\nWhich implies k < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nBut as we saw, k=3183 gives x \u2248 0.00003183, which is too small.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find the maximum k such that 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001.\n\nWait, but 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001\n\nSo, k < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, the maximum integer k is 3183, but as we saw, that gives x \u2248 0.00003183 < 0.0001, which is not acceptable.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the maximum k is 3183 - 1 = 3182, but as we saw, that gives x \u2248 0.0000999945 < 0.0001, which is still not acceptable.\n\nWait, so maybe I need to go lower.\n\nWait, let's compute 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001\n\nSo, k < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, the maximum k is 3183, but as we saw, that gives x \u2248 0.00003183 < 0.0001, which is too small.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the inequality.\n\nWait, let's think again.\n\nWe have x = 1/(k\u03c0)\n\nWe need x > 0.0001\n\nSo, 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001\n\nWhich implies k < 1/(0.0001 * \u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, k must be less than 3183.09886184, so the maximum integer k is 3183.\n\nBut when k=3183, x \u2248 0.00003183 < 0.0001, which is not acceptable.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the maximum k is the largest integer such that 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001.\n\nSo, let's solve for k:\n\n1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001\n\nWhich implies k < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nBut we need k to be such that 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001, so k must be less than 3183.09886184, but also, we need to ensure that 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001.\n\nWait, but if k=3183, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00003183 < 0.0001, so that's not acceptable.\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum k is 3182, but as we saw, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999945 < 0.0001, which is still less than 0.0001.\n\nWait, so maybe I need to go even lower.\n\nWait, let's compute when does 1/(k\u03c0) = 0.0001.\n\nSo, 1/(k\u03c0) = 0.0001\n\nk = 1/(0.0001 * \u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, when k = 3183.09886184, x = 0.0001.\n\nBut k must be an integer, so the integer just below 3183.09886184 is 3183, but as we saw, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00003183 < 0.0001, which is less than 0.0001.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory because if k increases, x decreases.\n\nWait, so perhaps the correct way is that as k increases, x decreases.\n\nSo, to have x > 0.0001, k must be less than 3183.09886184.\n\nBut when k=3183, x \u2248 0.00003183 < 0.0001, which is too small.\n\nSo, the maximum k such that x > 0.0001 is k=3183 - 1 = 3182, but as we saw, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999945 < 0.0001, which is still less than 0.0001.\n\nWait, so maybe even k=3181.\n\nLet me compute 1/(3181\u03c0):\n\n3181 * \u03c0 \u2248 3181 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3181 * 3.1415926535\n\nCompute 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796\n\n181 * \u03c0 \u2248 181 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 568.1234\n\nSo, total \u2248 9424.77796 + 568.1234 \u2248 10,000.90136\n\nSo, 1/(3181\u03c0) \u2248 1/10,000.90136 \u2248 0.0000999909, which is still less than 0.0001.\n\nWait, so perhaps I need to go lower.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find k such that 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001.\n\nSo, 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001\n\nk < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nBut as we saw, k=3183 gives x \u2248 0.00003183 < 0.0001, which is too small.\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum k is 3183 - n where n is such that 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001.\n\nWait, but this seems like a loop.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach it differently.\n\nLet me find the range of k such that 0.0001 < 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nSo, solving for k:\n\n1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 k < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nAnd\n\n1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001 \u21d2 k > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184\n\nSo, k must satisfy 318.309886184 < k < 3183.09886184\n\nSince k must be an integer, k ranges from 319 to 3183.\n\nBut wait, when k=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00003183 < 0.0001, which is outside the interval.\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum k is 3182, but as we saw, 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.0000999945 < 0.0001, which is still less than 0.0001.\n\nWait, so maybe the maximum k is 3183 - m where m is such that 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001.\n\nWait, perhaps I should solve for k in 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001.\n\nSo, k < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, the maximum integer k is 3183, but as we saw, that gives x < 0.0001, which is not acceptable.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the maximum k is 3183 - 1 = 3182, but as we saw, that gives x \u2248 0.0000999945 < 0.0001, which is still less than 0.0001.\n\nWait, so perhaps I need to go lower.\n\nWait, let me compute 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001\n\nSo, k < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, k can be up to 3183, but as we saw, k=3183 gives x too small.\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum k is 3183 - n, where n is such that 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001.\n\nWait, but this seems a bit circular.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should find the smallest k such that 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001, which is k > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so k starts at 319.\n\nAnd the largest k such that 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001, which is k < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so k goes up to 3183.\n\nBut as we saw, when k=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00003183 < 0.0001, which is outside the interval.\n\nTherefore, the maximum k is 3183 - 1 = 3182, but as we saw, that gives x\u22480.0000999945 < 0.0001, which is still less than 0.0001.\n\nWait, so perhaps I need to go even lower.\n\nWait, let me compute 1/(k\u03c0) for k=3183 - m until I get x > 0.0001.\n\nWait, but this might take a while.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the exact k where 1/(k\u03c0) = 0.0001.\n\nSo, k = 1/(0.0001 * \u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, the integer just below that is 3183, but as we saw, k=3183 gives x\u22480.00003183 < 0.0001.\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum k is 3183 - 1 = 3182, but that gives x\u22480.0000999945 < 0.0001.\n\nWait, so perhaps the maximum k is 3183 - n where n is such that 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001.\n\nBut this is getting too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can note that the number of zeros is equal to the number of k's such that 1/(k\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nSo, the number of k's is the number of integers k where 1000/\u03c0 < k < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nBut since 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, and 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184.\n\nSo, the number of integers k is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0)\n\nWhich is floor(3183.09886184) - ceil(318.309886184) = 3183 - 319 = 2864\n\nWait, but earlier I had 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, so which is correct?\n\nWait, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1.\n\nBut in this case, k must be greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, the smallest integer k is 319, and the largest integer k is 3183.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nBut as we saw, when k=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00003183 < 0.0001, which is outside the interval.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is actually 2864, because k=3183 is excluded.\n\nWait, but this is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the number of zeros is equal to the number of times the function oscillates between 0.0001 and 0.001.\n\nWait, but that might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the interval for x: (0.0001, 0.001)\n\nLet me make a substitution: let t = 1/x.\n\nThen, as x approaches 0 from the right, t approaches infinity.\n\nSo, when x is in (0.0001, 0.001), t is in (1000, 10000).\n\nSo, the function becomes y = sin(t), and we need to find the number of zeros of sin(t) in t \u2208 (1000, 10000).\n\nNow, sin(t) = 0 when t = n\u03c0 for integer n.\n\nSo, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nSo, solving for n:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDivide by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nSo, n must be integers between 318.309886184 and 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that when n=3183, t=3183\u03c0\u224810000.00616, which is greater than 10000, so x=1/t\u22480.000099999 < 0.0001, which is outside the interval.\n\nWait, but if t=3183\u03c0\u224810000.00616, which is greater than 10000, so x=1/t\u22480.000099999 < 0.0001, which is outside the interval.\n\nTherefore, the maximum n is such that n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nSo, n < 10000/\u03c0 \u22483183.09886184\n\nSo, the maximum integer n is 3183, but as we saw, that gives t\u224810000.00616, which is outside the interval.\n\nTherefore, the maximum n is 3183 - 1 = 3182, because n=3182 gives t=3182\u03c0\u224810000.00616 - \u03c0\u22489999.056, which is less than 10000.\n\nWait, let me compute 3182\u03c0:\n\n3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 10000 - \u03c0 \u2248 10000 - 3.1415926535 \u2248 9996.85840735, which is less than 10000.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 10000.00616 - \u03c0 \u2248 10000.00616 - 3.1415926535 \u2248 9996.864567, which is less than 10000.\n\nWait, that can't be because 3182 * \u03c0 should be less than 3183 * \u03c0, which is approximately 10000.00616.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 10000.00616\n\nSo, 3182 * \u03c0 = 3183\u03c0 - \u03c0 \u2248 10000.00616 - 3.1415926535 \u2248 9996.864567\n\nWait, that's way less than 10000, which can't be right because 3183\u03c0\u224810000.00616, so 3182\u03c0 should be approximately 10000.00616 - \u03c0 \u2248 9996.864567, which is less than 10000.\n\nWait, but that would mean that n=3182 gives t\u22489996.864567, which is within the interval (1000, 10000).\n\nWait, but when n=3183, t\u224810000.00616, which is just over 10000, so x=1/t\u22480.000099999 < 0.0001, which is outside the interval.\n\nSo, in terms of t, the interval is t \u2208 (1000, 10000), so n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nSo, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nBut when n=3183, t=3183\u03c0\u224810000.00616 > 10000, which is outside the interval.\n\nTherefore"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let me recall that sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 is an integer multiple of \u03c0. So, if I set 1/x equal to those multiples, I can find the x-values where the function crosses zero. That makes sense. So, let me write that down:\n\nsin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, where n is an integer.\n\nSolving for x, I get x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, each x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n. Now, I need to find all such x that lie in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nSo, I can set up the inequality:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nI need to solve this inequality for n. Let me rewrite it:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nHmm, to solve for n, I can take reciprocals, but I have to remember that when I take reciprocals in inequalities, the direction of the inequality signs reverses. So, let's do that step by step.\n\nFirst, let's take the left part of the inequality:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0).\n\nTaking reciprocals on both sides, we get:\n\n1/0.0001 > n\u03c0.\n\nCalculating 1/0.0001, that's 10000. So,\n\n10000 > n\u03c0.\n\nDividing both sides by \u03c0:\n\n10000/\u03c0 > n.\n\nSimilarly, for the right part of the inequality:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nTaking reciprocals:\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0.\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0.\n\nDividing both sides by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n.\n\nSo, putting both inequalities together:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nNow, I need to find all integer values of n that satisfy this inequality. Let's compute 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0 numerically to find the range of n.\n\nFirst, \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535.\n\nSo, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184.\n\nSimilarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184.\n\nSince n must be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319, and the largest possible n is 3183.\n\nNow, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1. Wait, actually, let me think carefully.\n\nThe number of integers between a and b inclusive is given by b - a + 1. So here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot of intercepts. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, 1000/\u03c0 is approximately 318.31, so the next integer is 319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 is approximately 3183.098, so the largest integer less than that is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319:\n\n3183 - 300 = 2883\n\n2883 - 19 = 2864\n\nThen, 2864 + 1 = 2865.\n\nSo, there are 2865 integer values of n, which correspond to 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait a second, that seems like a huge number of intercepts. Let me think about the function y = sin(1/x). As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. So, in any interval near zero, no matter how small, there are infinitely many x-intercepts. But in this case, the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is a fixed interval, albeit very close to zero.\n\nWait, but 0.0001 is 1e-4 and 0.001 is 1e-3. So, the interval is from 1e-4 to 1e-3. So, x is between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000. So, 1/x goes from 10000 down to 1000.\n\nSo, sin(1/x) will oscillate between -1 and 1 as 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000. Each time 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0, the sine function crosses zero. So, the number of zeros is equal to the number of multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000.\n\nWait, actually, when x increases, 1/x decreases, so the function sin(1/x) is oscillating with increasing frequency as x approaches zero. So, in the interval from x = 0.0001 to x = 0.001, 1/x goes from 10000 to 1000, so the number of zeros is the number of times 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0 in that interval.\n\nSo, the number of zeros is equal to the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Wait, that's the same as before. So, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.31 < n < 3183.098.\n\nSo, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but that seems correct. So, the function sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nLet me just think about whether I'm missing something. The function sin(1/x) oscillates between -1 and 1, and each oscillation crosses zero twice, except possibly at the endpoints. But in this case, since the interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), we don't include the endpoints, but the zeros occur strictly between 0.0001 and 0.001.\n\nWait, but actually, each zero crossing occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0), so as long as 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001), which is equivalent to n being in (1000/\u03c0, 10000/\u03c0). So, the number of such n is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider a smaller example. Suppose I take the interval (0.001, 0.002). Then, 1/x would range from 1000 to 500. So, the number of zeros would be the number of n such that 500 < n\u03c0 < 1000. So, n would be from ceiling(500/\u03c0) to floor(1000/\u03c0). Let me compute that.\n\n500/\u03c0 \u2248 159.15, so ceiling is 160.\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31, so floor is 318.\n\nSo, the number of n is 318 - 160 + 1 = 159.\n\nSo, in that interval, there are 159 zeros. That seems reasonable because from 500 to 1000, the number of \u03c0 multiples is about (1000 - 500)/\u03c0 \u2248 159.15, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, in our original problem, from 1000 to 10000, the number of \u03c0 multiples is (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 \u2248 9000/3.1416 \u2248 2866. But since we're taking integer n, it's 2865, which is consistent.\n\nWait, 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.197, so the number of integers is 2866, but since we're starting from n=319, which is the next integer after 318.31, and ending at n=3183, which is the integer part of 3183.098, the total number is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I think the answer is 2865.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0. Solving 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 gives n between approximately 318.31 and 3183.098, yielding 2865 integer values of n, hence 2865 x-intercepts.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let me recall that the sine function is zero at integer multiples of \u03c0. That is, sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 = n\u03c0, where n is an integer. So, for our function sin(1/x), setting that equal to zero gives 1/x = n\u03c0. Therefore, x = 1/(n\u03c0). \n\nSo, the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for each integer n. Now, I need to find all such x that lie in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Let me write that down:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nI need to solve for n in this inequality. Let me rearrange the inequalities to find the possible values of n.\n\nStarting with the left inequality:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0).\n\nIf I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that flipping the inequality when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive, I get:\n\n1/0.0001 > n\u03c0.\n\nCalculating 1/0.0001, that's 10000. So,\n\n10000 > n\u03c0.\n\nDividing both sides by \u03c0:\n\nn < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nSimilarly, for the right inequality:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nAgain, taking reciprocals:\n\nn\u03c0 > 1/0.001.\n\nWhich is:\n\nn\u03c0 > 1000.\n\nDividing both sides by \u03c0:\n\nn > 1000/\u03c0.\n\nSo, putting both inequalities together:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nNow, let me compute the numerical values of 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0. \n\nI know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So,\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184.\n\nBut n has to be an integer. So, n starts from the next integer after 318.309..., which is 319, and goes up to the integer just below 3183.098..., which is 3183.\n\nNow, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers, inclusive, I can subtract the smaller from the larger and add 1.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864.\n\nThen, 2864 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, I set sin(1/x) = 0, leading to 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). That part seems correct.\n\nThen, substituting the interval (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nSolving for n, I correctly took reciprocals, remembering to flip the inequalities because I'm taking reciprocals of positive numbers.\n\nSo, 1/0.0001 = 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0, which gives n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nSimilarly, 1/0.001 = 1000, so n\u03c0 > 1000, which gives n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184.\n\nSo, n must be an integer between 319 and 3183 inclusive.\n\nThen, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive, meaning there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but let me think about whether all these x-values actually lie within (0.0001, 0.001). Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), when n increases, x decreases. So, the smallest x is when n is largest, which is 3183, so x = 1/(3183\u03c0). Let me compute that to check if it's greater than 0.0001.\n\nCalculating 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 Let's see, 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, and 183\u03c0 \u2248 574.5926, so total \u2248 9424.77796 + 574.5926 \u2248 9999.37056. So, 1/(9999.37056) \u2248 approximately 0.000100006, which is just slightly above 0.0001. So, x \u2248 0.000100006, which is indeed within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.14) \u2248 0.0009968, which is just below 0.001, so it's within the interval as well.\n\nSo, all these x-values are indeed within (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check if I included both endpoints correctly. The interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), so does that include x=0.0001 or x=0.001? Since it's open, it doesn't include the endpoints, but in our case, the x-intercepts occur at x=1/(n\u03c0). So, for n=319, x\u22480.0009968, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. For n=3183, x\u22480.000100006, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. So, all these x-intercepts lie strictly inside the open interval, so we're okay.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is indeed greater than 0.0001. Let me compute 3183\u03c0:\n\n3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 Let me compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 183\u03c0 \u2248 574.5926, so total is 9424.77796 + 574.5926 \u2248 9999.37056. So, 1/9999.37056 \u2248 0.000100006, which is indeed greater than 0.0001. Similarly, for n=319, 319\u03c0 \u2248 1003.14, so 1/1003.14 \u2248 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001.\n\nTherefore, all these x-intercepts are within the interval (0.0001, 0.001), so the count is correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about whether n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, n=319, 320, ..., 3183. The number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me check with a smaller example to see if my method is correct. Suppose I wanted to find the number of x-intercepts in (0.1, 1). So, 0.1 < 1/x < 1, which implies 1 < x < 10. So, x = 1/(n\u03c0), so 1/(n\u03c0) must be between 0.1 and 1, so 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.1 implies n\u03c0 < 10, so n < 10/\u03c0 \u2248 3.183, so n can be 1,2,3. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 1 implies n > 1/\u03c0 \u2248 0.318, so n starts at 1. So, n=1,2,3, which gives x=1/\u03c0\u22480.318, 1/(2\u03c0)\u22480.159, 1/(3\u03c0)\u22480.106. All of these are between 0.1 and 1, so there are 3 x-intercepts. Using the formula, 3 - 1 +1=3, which is correct. So, my method works here.\n\nAnother test: interval (0.01, 0.1). Then, 0.01 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.1. So, 10 < n\u03c0 < 100, so n between 10/\u03c0\u22483.18 and 100/\u03c0\u224831.83. So, n=4 to 31, inclusive. Number of integers: 31 -4 +1=28. Let me see: x=1/(4\u03c0)\u22480.0796, which is less than 0.1, and greater than 0.01. Similarly, x=1/(31\u03c0)\u22480.0101, which is just above 0.01. So, 28 intercepts. That seems correct.\n\nTherefore, my method seems correct, so applying it to the original problem, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in the number of integers. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 is 2865. Let me compute 3183 - 319:\n\n3183 - 300 = 2883,\n\n2883 - 19 = 2864.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 2864 +1=2865.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

    "text": " Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 is an integer multiple of \u03c0. So, for sin(1/x) to be zero, 1/x must be equal to n\u03c0, where n is an integer. That means x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, each x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n.\n\nNow, the interval given is from 0.0001 to 0.001. Let me write that as 0.0001 < x < 0.001. I need to find all x in this interval such that x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, substituting the endpoints into the equation x = 1/(n\u03c0), I can find the range of n that satisfies this condition.\n\nLet me start by solving for n when x is 0.001. So, 0.001 = 1/(n\u03c0). Solving for n, I get n = 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1/(0.001 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(0.0031415926535) \u2248 318.31. Since n must be an integer, the maximum n in this interval would be 318 because 318\u03c0 \u2248 3.1415926535 * 318 \u2248 1000, and 1/1000 is 0.001.\n\nSimilarly, when x is 0.0001, which is 1/10000, I set up the equation 0.0001 = 1/(n\u03c0). Solving for n, I get n = 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 1/(0.0001 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(0.00031415926535) \u2248 3183.098. So, the minimum n would be 3184 because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 3.1415926535 * 3183 \u2248 10000.0009, which is just over 10000, making x just under 0.0001. Wait, no, actually, if n is 3184, then x would be 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0009) \u2248 0.000099999, which is just under 0.0001, so that's not in the interval. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me check again. If x = 0.0001, then n = 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, the smallest integer n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001 would be n = 3183, because 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000009, which is just over 0.0001. So, n starts at 3183 and goes up to 318, but wait, that can't be right because 3183 is much larger than 318. Wait, no, actually, when x increases, n decreases because x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, n decreases from 3183.098 to 318.31. So, n starts at 3183 and goes down to 319, because 318.31 is approximately 318, so the next integer down is 318, but wait, 318.31 is between 318 and 319. So, n would be 319, 318, 317, etc., down to 319? Wait, no, let me think again.\n\nWait, when x is 0.001, n is approximately 318.31, so the integer n would be 318, because 318\u03c0 \u2248 1000. So, x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.001. Similarly, when x is 0.0001, n is approximately 3183.098, so the integer n would be 3183, because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.0009, so x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001.\n\nWait, but 3183 is larger than 318, so as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, n decreases from 3183 to 318. So, the values of n that satisfy 0.0001 < x < 0.001 are n = 3184, 3183, 3182, ..., down to 319, 318. Wait, but 318.31 is approximately 318, so n would be 318, 319, 320, up to 3183? No, that doesn't make sense because as x increases, n decreases.\n\nWait, let me correct this. When x increases, 1/x decreases, so n = 1/(x\u03c0) decreases. So, when x is 0.001, n is about 318.31, so the maximum n is 318. When x is 0.0001, n is about 3183.098, so the minimum n is 3184. Wait, no, because 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so the smallest integer n is 3184 because 3183 would give x \u2248 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000009, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. Wait, no, the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, x = 1/(n\u03c0) must satisfy 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nSo, let's solve for n in both inequalities.\n\nFirst, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183.\n\nSecond, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u21d2 n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.31. So, n must be greater than 318.31, so the minimum integer n is 319.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 up to 3183, inclusive.\n\nNow, how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive? To find the number of integers, subtract 319 from 3183 and add 1: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, let me calculate that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 gives 2865.\n\nSo, there are 2865 integer values of n from 319 to 3183, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 1/(0.0031415926535) \u2248 318.309886184. So, n must be greater than this, so the smallest integer n is 319.\n\nSimilarly, 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 1/(0.00031415926535) \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be less than this, so the largest integer n is 3183.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865.\n\nSo, yes, 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me think again: for each integer n from 319 to 3183, there's a corresponding x = 1/(n\u03c0) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, the number of zeros is equal to the number of integers in that range, which is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check if 1/(3183\u03c0) is indeed greater than 0.0001. Let's compute 1/(3183 * \u03c0): 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.1416 \u2248 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.0416 \u2248 132. So, total \u2248 9549 + 318.3 + 132 \u2248 9999.3. So, 1/9999.3 \u2248 0.000100007, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. Similarly, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(319 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(1003.1) \u2248 0.0009969, which is just under 0.001, so it's included as well.\n\nWait, but 319\u03c0 \u2248 1003.1, so 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009969, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval.\n\nWait, but 318\u03c0 \u2248 1000.0009, so 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099999, which is just under 0.001, so it's included. So, n=318 gives x\u22480.00099999, which is within (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.0009969, which is also within the interval.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183, but when n=318, x\u22480.00099999, which is still within the interval. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier by not including n=318.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the inequalities.\n\nWe have x = 1/(n\u03c0) must satisfy 0.0001 < x < 0.001.\n\nSo, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nLet me solve for n in both inequalities.\n\nFirst, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nSecond, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u21d2 n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309886184.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184.\n\nSince n must be an integer, n can be 319, 320, ..., 3183.\n\nSo, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest is 3183.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that n=318 gives x\u22480.00099999, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. But according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309886184, so n=319 is the smallest integer. So, n=318 would give x\u22480.00099999, which is less than 0.001, so it's included, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309886184, so n=318 is less than that, so it's excluded. Wait, but 318 is less than 318.309886184, so n=318 would give x\u22480.00099999, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the inequality.\n\nWait, let me clarify: The inequality is 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which implies n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309886184. So, n must be greater than 318.309886184, so the smallest integer n is 319.\n\nSimilarly, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 3183.09886184, so the largest integer n is 3183.\n\nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which gives 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 integers.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that n=318 would give x\u22480.00099999, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval. But according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309886184, so n=318 is less than that, so it's excluded. Therefore, n starts at 319, which gives x\u22480.0009969, which is still within the interval.\n\nWait, but let me check: If n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.00099999, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309886184, so n=318 is less than that, so it's excluded. Therefore, n=318 is not included, so the smallest n is 319.\n\nWait, but that seems contradictory because n=318 gives x within the interval. So, perhaps the inequality is not strict. Wait, let's see:\n\nIf n=318, then x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.00099999, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, the inequality 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 is satisfied for n=318, because 1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.00099999 < 0.001. So, n=318 is allowed. Therefore, perhaps my earlier calculation was wrong.\n\nWait, let's solve the inequalities again:\n\nWe have 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nSo, first inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nSecond inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u21d2 n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309886184.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184.\n\nSince n must be an integer, n can be 319, 320, ..., 3183.\n\nWait, but 318.309886184 is approximately 318.31, so the smallest integer n is 319, because 318 is less than 318.31, so n=318 would give 1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.00099999, which is less than 0.001, but n=318 is less than 318.31, so according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.31, so n=318 is excluded. Therefore, n starts at 319.\n\nWait, but that seems counterintuitive because n=318 gives x\u22480.00099999, which is within the interval. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the inequality.\n\nWait, let me think again: The inequality is n > 318.309886184, so n must be greater than that, so the smallest integer n is 319.\n\nSimilarly, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so the largest integer n is 3183.\n\nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which gives 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 integers.\n\nWait, but when n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.00099999, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, why is n=318 excluded? Because according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309886184, which is approximately 318.31, so n=318 is less than that, so it's excluded. Therefore, n=318 is not included, so the x-intercept at x\u22480.00099999 is not counted. But that seems incorrect because x is within the interval.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the inequality. Let me double-check:\n\nWe have x = 1/(n\u03c0) must be in (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nSo, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nLet me solve for n:\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u21d2 n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309886184.\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184.\n\nSince n must be an integer, n can be 319, 320, ..., 3183.\n\nTherefore, n=318 is excluded because 318 < 318.309886184, so n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.00099999, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309886184, so n=318 is excluded. Therefore, n starts at 319.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory because x=1/(318\u03c0) is within the interval, but n=318 is excluded. Therefore, perhaps my initial approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that for x in (0.0001, 0.001), 1/x is in (1000, 10000). So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000.\n\nNow, sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 = k\u03c0 for integer k.\n\nSo, in this case, \u03b8 = 1/x, so \u03b8 ranges from 1000 to 10000.\n\nSo, the zeros occur at \u03b8 = k\u03c0, where k is an integer such that 1000 < k\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nSo, solving for k:\n\nk > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184.\n\nk < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, k must be integers from 319 up to 3183.\n\nTherefore, the number of zeros is the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that \u03b8 = 1/x, so when x approaches 0.001 from the right, \u03b8 approaches 1000, and when x approaches 0.0001 from the left, \u03b8 approaches 10000.\n\nSo, the number of zeros is the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000.\n\nSo, the number of zeros is equal to the number of integers k such that 1000 < k\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nWhich is the same as k being between 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, k ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 2865 integers.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation of 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 gives 2865.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but let me think about whether the endpoints are included. The interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. So, we have to make sure that the x-intercepts are strictly between these two values.\n\nSo, when x approaches 0.0001 from the right, \u03b8 = 1/x approaches 10000 from the left. Similarly, when x approaches 0.001 from the right, \u03b8 approaches 1000 from the right.\n\nSo, the zeros occur at \u03b8 = k\u03c0, where k is an integer such that 1000 < k\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nWhich again gives k from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 2865 zeros.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to make sure my approach is correct.\n\nSuppose I have an interval (a, b) where a = 0.0005 and b = 0.0006. Let's see how many x-intercepts there are.\n\nSo, x must satisfy 0.0005 < x < 0.0006.\n\nThen, \u03b8 = 1/x ranges from 1000 to 2000.\n\nSo, zeros occur at \u03b8 = k\u03c0 where k\u03c0 is between 1000 and 2000.\n\nSo, k must be between 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31 and 2000/\u03c0 \u2248 636.62.\n\nSo, k ranges from 319 to 636 inclusive.\n\nNumber of integers: 636 - 319 + 1 = 318.\n\nSo, 318 x-intercepts in that interval.\n\nIf I compute the number of zeros between \u03b8=1000 and \u03b8=2000, it's the number of k's such that 1000 < k\u03c0 < 2000, which is 319 to 636, which is 318 integers.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in our original problem, between \u03b8=1000 and \u03b8=10000, the number of k's is 319 to 3183, which is 2865.\n\nTherefore, I think my approach is correct.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let me recall that sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 is an integer multiple of \u03c0. So, if sin(1/x) = 0, then 1/x must be equal to n\u03c0, where n is an integer. That means x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, each x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n.\n\nNow, I need to find all such x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Let me write that down as inequalities:\n\n0.0001 < x < 0.001\n\nBut since x = 1/(n\u03c0), I can substitute that in:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nI need to solve for n here. Let me rewrite these inequalities:\n\nFirst inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0)\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0 (since n and \u03c0 are positive, the inequality sign doesn't change):\n\n0.0001 * n\u03c0 < 1\n\nThen, divide both sides by 0.0001\u03c0:\n\nn < 1 / (0.0001\u03c0)\n\nCalculate 1 / 0.0001: that's 10000. So, n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000/3.1416 \u2248 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n \u2264 3183.\n\nSecond inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nAgain, multiply both sides by n\u03c0:\n\n1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by 0.001\u03c0:\n\n1 / (0.001\u03c0) < n\n\nCalculate 1 / (0.001\u03c0): that's 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000/3.1416 \u2248 318.309. Since n must be an integer, n \u2265 319.\n\nSo, n must be an integer such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183.\n\nNow, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between a and b inclusive, it's b - a + 1.\n\nSo, 3183 - 319 + 1 = ?\n\nCalculate 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2865.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, 3183 - 319: Let's do it step by step.\n\n3183\n- 319\n= ?\n\nLet me subtract 300 first: 3183 - 300 = 2883\nThen subtract 19: 2883 - 19 = 2864\nThen add 1: 2865\n\nHmm, so 2865 integers. But let me think again: when I have n starting at 319 and going up to 3183, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with smaller numbers to see if the formula works. For example, from 1 to 5 inclusive: 5 - 1 + 1 = 5, which is correct. From 3 to 7: 7 - 3 + 1 = 5, which is correct. So, yes, the formula holds.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial inequalities.\n\nWe have x = 1/(n\u03c0) must be in (0.0001, 0.001). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nWhich leads to:\n\n1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0)\n\nCalculating 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309\n\n1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098\n\nSo, n must be greater than approximately 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319.\n\nSimilarly, n must be less than approximately 3183.098, so the largest integer n is 3183.\n\nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nLet me compute 3183 - 319:\n\n3183 - 300 = 2883\n\n2883 - 19 = 2864\n\nSo, 2864 + 1 = 2865.\n\nTherefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but let me think again: each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept, right? Because each n gives a unique x = 1/(n\u03c0), and each such x is in the interval if n is between 319 and 3183.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nBut wait, let me check if 1/(319\u03c0) is indeed greater than 0.0001.\n\nCompute 1/(319\u03c0): 1/(319 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(1002.3) \u2248 0.0009977, which is approximately 0.001, but wait, 0.0009977 is less than 0.001, right? Wait, 0.0009977 is 0.0009977, which is less than 0.001. So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009977, which is just below 0.001.\n\nWait, but our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.001. So, does x = 1/(319\u03c0) lie inside the interval? Since 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009977, which is less than 0.001, so yes, it's inside the interval.\n\nSimilarly, check the upper bound: 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, but wait, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.0001. So, does 1/(3183\u03c0) equal exactly 0.0001? Let's compute 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001.\n\nBut since 3183\u03c0 is slightly less than 10000, because \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let me compute it more accurately.\n\nCompute 3183 * 3.1415926535:\n\nFirst, 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796\n\nThen, 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 180\u03c0 \u2248 565.4867, and 3\u03c0 \u2248 9.42477, so total \u2248 565.4867 + 9.42477 \u2248 574.91147\n\nSo, total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796 + 574.91147 \u2248 9999.68943\n\nSo, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.68943, which is slightly less than 10000. Therefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.68943 \u2248 0.000100003, which is just over 0.0001.\n\nWait, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100003, which is greater than 0.0001. So, since our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.0001, does x = 1/(3183\u03c0) lie inside the interval? Since 0.000100003 > 0.0001, yes, it does. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is inside the interval.\n\nWait, but I thought 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.689, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.689 \u2248 0.000100003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 is included.\n\nSimilarly, for n=319, we have x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009977, which is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nSo, both n=319 and n=3183 give x values inside the interval.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers n from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check if n=3183 is the last one. Let me compute 1/(3184\u03c0):\n\n3184\u03c0 \u2248 3184 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 184\u03c0 \u2248 184 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 577.548, so total \u2248 9424.77796 + 577.548 \u2248 9992.32596, so 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/9992.32596 \u2248 0.000100077, which is still above 0.0001, so x=1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100077 is still in the interval. Wait, but earlier we had 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.689, so 3184\u03c0 \u2248 3183\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2248 9999.689 + 3.1416 \u2248 10002.8306. Therefore, 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/10002.8306 \u2248 0.000099972, which is less than 0.0001. Wait, that contradicts my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 3184 * \u03c0 accurately.\n\nCompute 3184 * \u03c0:\n\n3184 * 3.1415926535\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n3000 * \u03c0 = 9424.77796\n\n184 * \u03c0 \u2248 184 * 3.1415926535\n\nCompute 100\u03c0 \u2248 314.15926535\n\n80\u03c0 \u2248 251.327412287\n\n4\u03c0 \u2248 12.566370614\n\nSo, 184\u03c0 \u2248 314.15926535 + 251.327412287 + 12.566370614 \u2248 314.15926535 + 251.327412287 = 565.486677637 + 12.566370614 \u2248 578.053048251\n\nTherefore, 3184\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796 + 578.053048251 \u2248 9992.83099925\n\nSo, 3184\u03c0 \u2248 9992.831, so 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/9992.831 \u2248 0.000100072, which is approximately 0.000100072, which is just over 0.0001. So, 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100072 > 0.0001, so x=1/(3184\u03c0) is still inside the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but earlier, when n=3183, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. Similarly, n=3184 gives x\u22480.000100072, which is also included. Wait, but earlier I thought that n=3183 gives x\u22480.000100003, which is just above 0.0001, so included. But then n=3184 would give x\u22480.000100072, which is still above 0.0001, so included. But then, when does x become less than 0.0001?\n\nWait, let's find n such that 1/(n\u03c0) = 0.0001.\n\nSolving for n: n = 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, n \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so the maximum integer n is 3183, because 3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100072, which is still greater than 0.0001. Wait, but 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100072, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Wait, but 3184\u03c0 \u2248 9992.831, so 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100072, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, so does that mean that n can go up to 3183, but n=3184 also gives x inside the interval? But wait, 3184\u03c0 \u2248 9992.831, so 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100072, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nWait, but 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.689, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100003, which is just over 0.0001, included.\n\nWait, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express the inequality.\n\nWe have x = 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001.\n\nSo,\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0)\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nCompute 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184\n\n10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184.\n\nSince n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183, because 3183 is less than 3183.09886184, so 3183 is included.\n\nWait, but 3183.09886184 is approximately 3183.09886184, so n=3183 is less than that, so it's included. n=3184 would be 3184, which is greater than 3183.09886184, so it's excluded.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nLet me compute that again:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\n2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nSo, 2865 integers.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that n=3184 would give x\u22480.000100072, which is still greater than 0.0001, but according to the inequality, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so n=3184 is excluded. So, n goes up to 3183.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with n=3183:\n\nx = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(9999.689) \u2248 0.000100003, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nn=3184 would give x\u22481/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.000100072, which is also just over 0.0001, but since n must be less than 3183.09886184, n=3184 is excluded.\n\nWait, but 3184 is greater than 3183.09886184, so n=3184 is excluded, so the maximum n is 3183.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check with n=3183 and n=3184.\n\nn=3183: x\u22480.000100003 > 0.0001, included.\n\nn=3184: x\u22480.000100072 > 0.0001, included.\n\nWait, but according to the inequality, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so n=3184 is greater than that, so it's excluded. Therefore, n=3184 is excluded, so the maximum n is 3183.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nBut wait, let me compute 3183 - 319 +1:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\n2864 +1 = 2865\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but let me think about the behavior of sin(1/x). As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, and sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. But in our case, the interval is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a finite interval, but very close to zero.\n\nEach time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the sine function completes a half-period, so each x-intercept occurs when 1/x increases by \u03c0. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is approximately the length of the interval in terms of 1/x divided by \u03c0.\n\nWait, let me express it differently. The interval for x is from 0.0001 to 0.001. Let me find the corresponding interval for 1/x.\n\n1/x goes from 1000 to 10000.\n\nSo, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000.\n\nThe sine function has zeros at every multiple of \u03c0, so the number of zeros between 1000 and 10000 is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0).\n\nWait, that's another way to compute it.\n\nCompute 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184\n\n10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, the number of zeros is floor(3183.09886184) - ceil(318.309886184) + 1?\n\nWait, no, because the number of integers between a and b is floor(b) - ceil(a) + 1.\n\nSo, floor(10000/\u03c0) = 3183\n\nceil(1000/\u03c0) = 319\n\nSo, number of zeros is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0. Solving for x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) leads to x = 1/(n\u03c0) where n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

    "text": " Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 is an integer multiple of \u03c0. So, sin(\u03b8) = 0 implies \u03b8 = n\u03c0, where n is an integer. In this case, \u03b8 is 1/x, so setting that equal to n\u03c0 gives 1/x = n\u03c0. Solving for x, I get x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, every x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n.\n\nNow, I need to find all such x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Let me write that as 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), I can substitute that into the inequality to find the range of n.\n\nStarting with the lower bound: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that reversing the inequality because reciprocating positive numbers reverses the inequality, I get 10000 > n\u03c0. So, n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating that, \u03c0 is approximately 3.14159265, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 10000 / 3.14159265 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.098.\n\nSimilarly, for the upper bound: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0, which is 1000 < n\u03c0. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that, 1000 / 3.14159265 \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309.\n\nSince n has to be an integer, n must satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Now, I need to count the integers from 319 up to 3183, inclusive.\n\nTo find how many integers are in this range, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add one (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865.\n\nWait, let me double-check that calculation. 3183 minus 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more, which gives 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial bounds. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is an open interval, so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. However, since x = 1/(n\u03c0) must lie strictly between 0.0001 and 0.001, I need to ensure that 1/(n\u03c0) is not equal to 0.0001 or 0.001. So, n must satisfy n > 1000/\u03c0 and n < 10000/\u03c0, but n cannot be exactly 1000/\u03c0 or 10000/\u03c0 because those would make x equal to the endpoints, which are excluded.\n\nBut since n has to be an integer, and 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, the smallest integer n can be is 319, as I initially thought. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so the largest integer n can be is 3183. So, my initial calculation still holds because n is strictly less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, and strictly greater than 318.309, so the minimum integer n is 319.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, and 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers in that range, meaning there are 2865 x-intercepts in the given interval.\n\nWait a second, let me think about this again. Is there any possibility that I missed something? For example, could the function sin(1/x) have more than one x-intercept between 1/(n\u03c0) and 1/((n+1)\u03c0)? Or is it guaranteed that each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept?\n\nWell, the function sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. Each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the sine function completes a half-period, going from 0 up to 1, back down to 0, down to -1, and back to 0. So, between each consecutive pair of zeros, the function crosses the x-axis once. So, each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept. Therefore, the number of zeros is exactly equal to the number of integers n in that range, which is 2865.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check: when n increases by 1, does x decrease by a certain amount? Let me see: x = 1/(n\u03c0), so as n increases, x decreases. So, the x-intercepts get closer together as x approaches 0, which makes sense for sin(1/x). So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a relatively small interval near 0, the function oscillates rapidly, leading to many zeros.\n\nBut let me just confirm the count again. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\n2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning, so I'm confident with this result.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\). This occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for some integer \\( n \\), which implies \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n\nWe need \\( x \\) to be in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\). This translates to the inequalities:\n\\[ 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\]\n\nTaking reciprocals, we get:\n\\[ 1000 < n\\pi < 10000 \\]\n\nDividing by \\( \\pi \\) (approximately 3.14159265), we find:\n\\[ \\frac{1000}{\\pi} \\approx 318.309 < n < \\frac{10000}{\\pi} \\approx 3183.098 \\]\n\nSince \\( n \\) must be an integer, the smallest possible \\( n \\) is 319 and the largest possible \\( n \\) is 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is calculated as:\n\\[ 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 \\]\n\nThus, the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts is \\(\\boxed{2865}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let me recall that the sine function is zero at integer multiples of \u03c0. That is, sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 = n\u03c0, where n is an integer. So, if I set 1/x equal to n\u03c0, I can solve for x and find the points where the function is zero.\n\nSo, let me write that down: 1/x = n\u03c0. Solving for x, I get x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, each x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n. \n\nNow, I need to find all such x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, I can write the inequalities: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. \n\nI think the next step is to solve for n in this inequality. Let me rearrange each part. Starting with the left inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides (and remember that flipping the inequality sign when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive), I get 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0, which is 10000 > n\u03c0. Similarly, for the right inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, taking reciprocals gives n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is n\u03c0 > 1000.\n\nSo now I have: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. To find n, I can divide each part by \u03c0. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. \n\nCalculating these values numerically will help. Let me compute 1000/\u03c0. Since \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is about 1000 / 3.1415926535. Let me compute that: 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. \n\nSimilarly, 10000/\u03c0 is 10000 divided by \u03c0, which is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. \n\nSo, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n can take integer values starting from the next integer after 318.309886184, which is 319, up to the integer just below 3183.09886184, which is 3183. \n\nNow, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 319 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. \n\nWait, let me verify that calculation: 3183 minus 319. Let me compute 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. So, yes, 3183 - 319 = 2864, then adding 1 gives 2865. \n\nTherefore, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Each of these n corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). \n\nBut wait a second, I should check if all these x-values lie strictly within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Let me check the smallest and largest n to see if their corresponding x-values are indeed within the interval.\n\nStarting with n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0). Let me compute that. First, 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let me compute 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477796, and 19\u03c0 \u2248 59.6902604, so total is 942.477796 + 59.6902604 \u2248 1002.168056. Therefore, x \u2248 1/1002.168056 \u2248 0.0009978, which is approximately 0.0009978, which is just under 0.001. So, 0.0009978 is within (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nNow, for n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0). Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0. Let's approximate this: 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, and 183\u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 180\u03c0 \u2248 565.486677, and 3\u03c0 \u2248 9.42477796, so total is 565.486677 + 9.42477796 \u2248 574.911455. So, 3000\u03c0 + 183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796 + 574.911455 \u2248 10,000 (approximately). So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so x \u2248 1/10,000 = 0.0001. But since n = 3183, let's be precise. \n\nWait, 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10,000 because 3183 is slightly more than 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 3183.09886184. So, 3183\u03c0 is exactly 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute that more accurately. \n\nAlternatively, since 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so 3183 is just slightly less than 10000/\u03c0. Therefore, 3183\u03c0 is slightly less than 10000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000 - (0.09886184 * \u03c0). Let me compute 0.09886184 * \u03c0 \u2248 0.09886184 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 0.309886184. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000 - 0.309886184 \u2248 9999.69011382. Therefore, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.69011382 \u2248 0.000100003, which is just over 0.0001. But our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at both ends, meaning it doesn't include 0.0001 and 0.001. So, does x = 1/(3183\u03c0) lie within the interval? Let me check the value: 0.000100003 is just barely above 0.0001, so it's within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nWait, but actually, since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, the endpoints are excluded. So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.000100003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. Similarly, x = 1/(319\u03c0) is approximately 0.0009978, which is just below 0.001, so it's included as well. \n\nTherefore, all the x-intercepts from n = 319 up to n = 3183 are within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. \n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive. The formula is (last - first) + 1. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 gives 2865. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, another way to compute the number of integers between a and b inclusive is floor(b) - ceil(a) + 1. In this case, a is approximately 318.309886, so ceil(a) is 319, and b is approximately 3183.09886184, so floor(b) is 3183. Therefore, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that checks out. \n\nI think that's the answer then. The number of x-intercepts is 2865. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider whether there's any possibility I missed or double-counted. Each n gives a unique x = 1/(n\u03c0), and since n ranges from 319 to 3183, each x is unique and within the interval. So, I don't think there's any overlap or missing counts here. \n\nSo, yeah, I think 2865 is the correct number of x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integers n. Solving for x gives x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, or 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating these bounds gives n ranging from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let me recall that the sine function equals zero at integer multiples of \u03c0. That is, sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 = n\u03c0, where n is an integer. So, in this case, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0. \n\nLet me write that down: 1/x = n\u03c0. If I solve for x, I get x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, each x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n. \n\nNow, I need to find all such x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, I can set up inequalities: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. \n\nLet me rewrite that to find the range of n. If I take reciprocals (and reverse the inequalities because reciprocating positive numbers reverses the inequalities), I get 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. \n\nCalculating those reciprocals: 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. \n\nNow, to solve for n, I can divide each part by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. \n\nLet me compute those values numerically. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926536. \n\nSo, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926536 \u2248 318.309886184. \n\nSimilarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926536 \u2248 3183.09886184. \n\nSince n must be an integer, n ranges from the next integer greater than 318.309886184 up to the integer less than 3183.09886184. \n\nSo, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183. \n\nNow, to find how many integers are in this range from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). \n\nWait, actually, let me think carefully. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. \n\nCalculating that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then 2864 + 1 is 2865. \n\nSo, there are 2865 integer values of n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. \n\nWait a second, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. \n\n1. I started by setting sin(1/x) = 0, which gives 1/x = n\u03c0. That seems correct because sin(\u03b8) is zero at \u03b8 = n\u03c0.\n\n2. Then, solving for x gives x = 1/(n\u03c0). That makes sense.\n\n3. Plugging in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Correct.\n\n4. Taking reciprocals, I reversed the inequalities to get 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Yes, because taking reciprocals of positive numbers reverses the inequality.\n\n5. Dividing by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. That seems accurate.\n\n6. Therefore, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. That seems right.\n\nIs there any chance I missed something? Let me think about the endpoints. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, meaning it doesn't include the endpoints. So, I need to make sure that x = 1/(n\u03c0) is strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. \n\nSo, when n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0). Let me compute that: 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 1002. So, 1/1002 \u2248 0.000998, which is approximately 0.001, but actually a bit less than 0.001. Wait, 0.000998 is less than 0.001, so 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000998, which is within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, for n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0). Let's compute that: 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since it's 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 10000, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001. So, does 1/(3183\u03c0) equal 0.0001 exactly? Let me check.\n\nWait, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926536, 3183 * \u03c0 is exactly 10000. So, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 10000. Therefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) = 0.0001 exactly. But the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which doesn't include 0.0001. Therefore, n = 3183 would give x = 0.0001, which is excluded. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but since 3183\u03c0 is exactly 10000, which gives x = 0.0001, which is excluded, so n should be up to 3182? Wait, no, wait.\n\nWait, let me think again. The inequality is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must satisfy n\u03c0 > 1000 and n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31 and n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but wait, 3183\u03c0 is exactly 10000, so n\u03c0 = 10000, which would make x = 0.0001, which is excluded. So, actually, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but since 3183\u03c0 is exactly 10000, which is the upper bound, which is excluded, so n can be up to 3182? Wait, no, because 3183\u03c0 is 10000, which is the upper limit, but our interval is up to 0.001, which is 1/1000. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the initial inequalities. We have 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, taking reciprocals, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must satisfy n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3099 and n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988. So, n can be from 319 up to 3183, inclusive, because 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10000, which is the upper bound, but since n must be less than 3183.0988, n can be 3183 because 3183 < 3183.0988. Wait, but 3183 is less than 3183.0988, so n can be 3183. But then x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the excluded endpoint. So, does n=3183 produce x=0.0001, which is not included? So, n must be less than 3183.0988, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but since 3183\u03c0 = 10000, which gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so n must be less than 3183.0988, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but since 3183\u03c0 = 10000, which is excluded, so n must be up to 3182? Wait, no, because 3183\u03c0 is 10000, which is the upper limit, but since the interval is open, we have to exclude x=0.0001. So, n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so n must be less than 3183.0988, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so n must go up to 3182. \n\nWait, let me clarify. The inequality is n < 3183.0988, so the maximum integer n is 3183 because 3183 < 3183.0988. But n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is exactly the excluded endpoint. So, we need to exclude n=3183 because x=0.0001 is not included in the interval. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.0988, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but since n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, we have to take n up to 3182. \n\nWait, but 3182\u03c0 is approximately 3182*3.1415926536 \u2248 let's compute that. 3182 * 3.1415926536. Let's see, 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, and 182\u03c0 \u2248 571. So, total is approximately 9424.77796 + 571 \u2248 10,  (Wait, 3000\u03c0 is 9424.77796, 182\u03c0 is approximately 571. So, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796 + 571 \u2248 10,  (Wait, 9424.77796 + 571 = 10,  (Wait, 9424.77796 + 571 = 9995.77796). So, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9995.77796, which is less than 10000. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9995.77796 \u2248 0.0001000425, which is slightly more than 0.0001. So, x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.0001000425, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. \n\nWait, but 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9995.77796, so 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000425, which is just a bit above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n=3182 gives x\u22480.0001000425, which is included. \n\nSimilarly, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)=1/10000=0.0001, which is excluded. So, n=3183 is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought n could go up to 3183 because 3183 < 3183.0988, but since n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, we have to stop at n=3182. \n\nSo, now, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 + 1 = 2864. \n\nWait, so earlier I had 2865, but now I'm getting 2864. Which one is correct? Let me think carefully. \n\nIf n starts at 319 and ends at 3182, inclusive, the number of terms is 3182 - 319 + 1. So, 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, that would be 2864. \n\nBut wait, earlier I thought n goes up to 3183, which would give 2865. But since n=3183 is excluded, it's 2864. \n\nBut wait, let me check with specific numbers. Let's say n starts at 319 and ends at 3182. So, how many numbers is that? \n\nLet me take a smaller example. Suppose I have numbers from 3 to 5 inclusive. That's 3,4,5. So, 5 - 3 + 1 = 3 numbers. Correct. \n\nSimilarly, from 319 to 3182 inclusive: 3182 - 319 + 1. So, 3182 - 319 is 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, that's 2864 numbers. \n\nBut wait, earlier I thought n goes up to 3183, but n=3183 is excluded, so the maximum n is 3182, which gives 2864 numbers. So, the correct count is 2864. \n\nWait, but let me double-check the initial calculation. \n\nWe have 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. \n\nSo, n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3099 \n\nn < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988 \n\nSo, n can be integers from 319 up to 3183, but since 3183\u03c0 = 10000, which gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so n must be less than 3183.0988, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but n=3183 is excluded because x=0.0001 is excluded. Therefore, n goes up to 3182. \n\nSo, the number of integers is from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought n could go up to 3183, giving 2865, but now I'm getting 2864. So, which is correct? \n\nLet me think differently. Let's compute the number of n's such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nSo, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \n\nWhich implies 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000 \n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \n\nWhich is approximately 318.3099 < n < 3183.0988 \n\nSo, n can be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, because 3183 is less than 3183.0988. \n\nBut wait, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001 exactly, which is excluded. So, n must be less than 3183.0988, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but n=3183 is excluded because x=0.0001 is excluded. Therefore, n must be up to 3182. \n\nSo, the number of integers is from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. \n\nWait, but let's check with n=3182: 3182\u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926536 \u2248 10,  let me compute that more accurately. \n\n3182 * \u03c0: \n\nFirst, 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796 \n\n182\u03c0 \u2248 571.00 (since \u03c0\u22483.14159265, 182*3.14159265\u2248571.00). \n\nSo, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796 + 571 \u2248 9995.77796 \n\nSo, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9995.77796 \u2248 0.0001000425 \n\nWhich is approximately 0.00010004, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nSimilarly, n=3183: 3183\u03c0 = 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 10000.0000 (since 3183 * \u03c0 is exactly 10000). So, x=1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001, which is excluded. \n\nTherefore, n=3183 is excluded, so the maximum n is 3182. \n\nThus, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, which is correct? \n\nLet me compute 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, that's correct. \n\nBut wait, let me think again. If n starts at 319 and ends at 3182, how many terms is that? \n\nFor example, if I have numbers from 1 to 5, that's 5 numbers. So, 5 - 1 + 1 = 5. \n\nSimilarly, from 319 to 3182: 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nBut wait, earlier I thought n goes up to 3183, giving 2865, but since n=3183 is excluded, it's 2864. \n\nSo, the correct number of x-intercepts is 2864. \n\nWait, but let me think again: when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.000998, which is just below 0.001, so it's included. \n\nn=3182: x\u22480.00010004, which is just above 0.0001, so included. \n\nn=3183: x=0.0001, excluded. \n\nSo, the number of n's is from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 2864. \n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. \n\nWait, but let me check with a different approach. \n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. The number of oscillations increases as x gets closer to 0. \n\nIn the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is from x=0.0001 to x=0.001, the function sin(1/x) will cross the x-axis every time 1/x increases by \u03c0. \n\nSo, the number of zeros is approximately the difference in 1/x divided by \u03c0. \n\nSo, 1/x goes from 1000 to 10000 as x goes from 0.001 to 0.0001. \n\nSo, the total change in 1/x is 10000 - 1000 = 9000. \n\nTherefore, the number of zeros is approximately 9000 / \u03c0 \u2248 2866. \n\nWait, but that's an approximation. So, 9000 / \u03c0 \u2248 2866.197, which is approximately 2866. \n\nBut earlier, I calculated 2864. So, there's a discrepancy here. \n\nWait, but let me think: the number of zeros is the number of times 1/x passes through n\u03c0 as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001. \n\nEach zero corresponds to n increasing by 1. \n\nSo, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0) + 1. \n\nWait, let me compute that. \n\nceil(1000/\u03c0) = ceil(318.3099) = 319 \n\nfloor(10000/\u03c0) = floor(3183.0988) = 3183 \n\nSo, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought n=3183 is excluded because x=0.0001 is excluded. \n\nBut according to this formula, it's floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0) + 1 = 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. \n\nBut in reality, n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so we have to subtract 1. \n\nSo, the correct count is 2865 - 1 = 2864. \n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. \n\nWait, but let me confirm with another approach. \n\nThe number of zeros is equal to the number of times 1/x crosses an integer multiple of \u03c0 as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001. \n\nSo, starting at x=0.001, 1/x=1000. The next zero is at 1/x=1000 + \u03c0, which is approximately 1003.1416, so x\u22481/1003.1416\u22480.00099686. \n\nThen, the next zero is at 1/x=1003.1416 + \u03c0\u22481006.2832, x\u22480.0009936. \n\nAnd this continues until 1/x approaches 10000, which is x=0.0001. \n\nBut since x=0.0001 is excluded, the last zero before x=0.0001 is at 1/x=10000 - \u03c0, which is approximately 9996.8584, so x\u22481/9996.8584\u22480.0001000314. \n\nSo, the number of zeros is the number of n's such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. \n\nSo, n ranges from ceil(1000/\u03c0)=319 to floor((10000 - \u03b5)/\u03c0), where \u03b5 is a very small positive number to exclude the endpoint. \n\nBut floor((10000 - \u03b5)/\u03c0) = floor(10000/\u03c0 - \u03b5/\u03c0) \u2248 floor(3183.0988 - \u03b5/\u03c0) = 3183 - 1 = 3182. \n\nWait, no, because 10000/\u03c0 is exactly 3183.0988... So, floor(10000/\u03c0) is 3183, but since we need to exclude the endpoint, it's 3182. \n\nTherefore, the number of n's is from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. \n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. \n\nBut wait, let me think about the formula again. \n\nThe number of integers n satisfying a < n < b is floor(b - 1) - ceil(a) + 1. \n\nWait, no, the formula is floor(b) - ceil(a) + 1 if a and b are real numbers and n must be integer. \n\nBut in our case, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which is equivalent to n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248318.3099 and n < 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.0988. \n\nSo, the number of integers n is floor(3183.0988) - ceil(318.3099) + 1 = 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. \n\nBut since n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, we need to subtract 1, giving 2864. \n\nAlternatively, the number of integers n satisfying 318.3099 < n < 3183.0988 is floor(3183.0988) - ceil(318.3099) = 3183 - 319 = 2864. \n\nWait, because the number of integers between a and b exclusive is floor(b) - ceil(a). \n\nSo, in this case, the number of integers n such that 318.3099 < n < 3183.0988 is floor(3183.0988) - ceil(318.3099) = 3183 - 319 = 2864. \n\nYes, that makes sense. \n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. \n\nTherefore, after careful consideration, I conclude that the number of x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Solving for x gives x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing by \u03c0, we find n ranges from 319 to 3182, yielding 2864 integers.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\n$\\boxed{2864}$"
