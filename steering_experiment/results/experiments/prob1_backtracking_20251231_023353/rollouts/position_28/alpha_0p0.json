Now, to find how many integers are in this range, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add one (since both endpoints are included when considering integers). So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. Hmm, 3183 - 319 is indeed 2864, so adding 1 gives 2865. But wait, let me make sure that n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me double-check the initial substitution. When x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, then 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. Now, sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 is an integer multiple of \u03c0, so \u03b8 = n\u03c0. So, the zeros occur at \u03b8 = \u03c0, 2\u03c0, 3\u03c0, ..., up to \u03b8 = 10000. So, the number of zeros would be the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. Alternatively, the number of integers n such that 1000 \u2264 n\u03c0 \u2264 10000. Solving for n: 1000 / \u03c0 \u2264 n \u2264 10000 / \u03c0. Calculating those: 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, yes, that's consistent.

Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of integers is 3183 - 318 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 318 = 2865, then 2865 + 1 = 2866. Wait, that seems too high. Let me check my calculations again. Hmm, 3183 - 318 is 2865, yes, and adding 1 gives 2866. But let me think about this again. The lower bound was approximately 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. The upper bound was approximately 3183.098, so the largest integer n is 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Wait, no, that's not right. The formula for the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, if a is 319 and b is 3183, then it's 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, so I think I made a mistake earlier. The correct number should be 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2866. Let me double-check. If n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, then the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in setting up the inequalities. Let me go back. The original interval for x is (0.0001, 0.001). So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, substituting x = 1/(n\u03c0), we have 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and remembering that flipping the inequality when taking reciprocals since all terms are positive), we get 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Then, dividing each part by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating those: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098. Therefore, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, there are 2865 x-intercepts. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when dealing with inequalities, especially when dealing with reciprocals, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me confirm by plugging in n=319 and n=3183 to see if x is within the interval. For n=319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.55) \u2248 0.0009975, which is just under 0.001, so that's within the upper bound. For n=3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, we need to check if 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001 exactly. But our interval is x > 0.0001, so x must be greater than 0.0001. Therefore, n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is the lower bound, but since the interval is open, x=0.0001 is excluded. So, does that mean n can only go up to 3182? Let me check. If n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is not included. So, the largest n for which x > 0.0001 is n=3182. Let's compute x for n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182*3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000 - something). Let me compute 3182*\u03c0 \u2248 3182*3.1416 \u2248 10000 - let's see, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000, so 3182\u03c0 \u2248 10000 - \u03c0 \u2248 10000 - 3.1416 \u2248 9996.8584. So, x=1/9996.8584 \u2248 0.00010003, which is just over 0.0001, so that's acceptable. Therefore, n can go up to 3182. So, now, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, that would be 2864 x-intercepts. Wait, but earlier I thought n went up to 3183, but since x=1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001 exactly, which is excluded, so n only goes up to 3182. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. Hmm, that's different from my earlier calculation. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by including n=3183. Let me confirm this carefully.\n\nFirst, the inequality is 0.0001 < x < 0.001, and x=1/(n\u03c0). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities because reciprocals flip the inequality for positive numbers):\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDivide all parts by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098\n\nSo, n must be greater than approximately 318.309 and less than approximately 3183.098.\n\nSince n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. But wait, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is exactly the lower bound. Since the interval is open (0.0001, 0.001), x must be greater than 0.0001, so n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nNumber of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1.\n\nSo, 3182 - 319 + 1 = 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 is 2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but now it's 2864. So, which one is correct? Let me check with specific examples.\n\nLet me take a smaller example to test. Suppose I have n from 2 to 5 inclusive. How many numbers? 5 - 2 + 1 = 4 numbers: 2,3,4,5. So, yes, the formula works.\n\nIn this case, from 319 to 3182 inclusive, the number is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nSo, that should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that n=3182 gives x=1/(3182\u03c0) which is greater than 0.0001. Let me compute 1/(3182\u03c0). 3182*3.1416 \u2248 3182*3.1416. Let's compute 3000*3.1416=9424.8, 182*3.1416\u2248572. So total \u2248 9424.8 + 572 \u2248 10,000. So, 3182\u03c0\u224810,000, so 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.0001. But since 3182\u03c0 is slightly less than 10,000 (because 3183\u03c0\u224810,000 + \u03c0), wait no, 3183\u03c0\u22483183*3.1416\u224810,000. So, 3182\u03c0\u224810,000 - \u03c0\u22489996.8584. So, 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22481/9996.8584\u22480.00010003, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3182 is valid, and n=3183 is excluded because x=0.0001 exactly, which is not in the open interval. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the calculation again. 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 is 2864. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is 2864 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, where did I go wrong? It seems I initially included n=3183, but upon realizing that x=1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001 is excluded, I had to adjust and include up to n=3182, which reduces the count by 1, making it 2864 instead of 2865.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nTaking reciprocals:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098\n\nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. The number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\n$\\boxed{2864}$"

Wait, let me check that calculation again. 3183 - 318 is 2865, and adding 1 gives 2866. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 2866 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive, which means there are 2866 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. So, when x is 0.0001, 1/x is 10000, and when x is 0.001, 1/x is 1000. So, sin(1/x) will have zeros at every n\u03c0 between 1000 and 10000.

So, that would mean there are 2865 integer values of n that satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183, each corresponding to an x-intercept in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me double-check my calculations. Let's compute 3183 - 319. 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then minus 19 is 2864. So, yes, adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, but let me think again. Each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept, right? So, if n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, then the number of intercepts is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial substitution. So, x is in (0.0001, 0.001), so 1/x is in (1000, 10000). Because 1/0.001 is 1000 and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. Therefore, 1/x = n\u03c0 implies n = (1/x)/\u03c0. So, n must be between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.31 and 3183.098, as I had before. So, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183. So, that's correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Yeah, that seems right. So, the function y = sin(1/x) crosses the x-axis 2865 times between x = 0.0001 and x = 0.001.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for each integer n. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000, so n ranges from 319 to 3183. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think: the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.

That seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I don't think I made any mistakes here.

Then, setting up the inequalities: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n, I correctly inverted the inequalities because when I took reciprocals, the direction of the inequalities reversed. Wait, hold on, actually, when I took reciprocals, I should have reversed the inequalities. Let me check that again. Starting with 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Taking reciprocals on both sides, since both sides are positive, the inequality reverses: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. So, 10000 > n\u03c0, which leads to n < 10000/\u03c0, which is correct as before. Similarly, for 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, taking reciprocals gives n\u03c0 > 1000, so n > 1000/\u03c0, which is also correct. So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183.

So, number of integers = 3183 - 319 + 1 Let me calculate that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems like a lot of intercepts. Let me double-check my calculations. First, the substitution step: x = 1/(n\u03c0), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Then, solving for n: For the lower bound, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, so n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. For the upper bound, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, so n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, n must be integers greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098.

Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 2865 x-intercepts in that interval. But wait, let me think again. Is there any possibility that some of these n values might lead to x outside the interval? Let me check with n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.09) \u2248 0.000997, which is greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. Similarly, for n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.00) \u2248 0.0001, but since the interval is open at 0.0001, does x=0.0001 count? No, because the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which doesn't include the endpoints. So, n=3183 would give x\u22480.0001, which is not included. Therefore, the upper limit for n is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000 - \u03c0) \u2248 slightly greater than 0.0001, so still within the interval. Wait, let me compute 1/(3182\u03c0). Let me compute 3182\u03c0: 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416. Let's see, 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77, 182\u03c0 \u2248 571.64, so total \u2248 9424.77 + 571.64 \u2248 9996.41. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.41 \u2248 0.000100036, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=3183: 3183\u03c0 \u2248 3183*3.1416 \u2248 10000.00 approximately. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, n can go up to 3182. So, the upper limit is n=3182. Let me adjust the calculation: n starts at 319 and goes up to 3182. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, 2864 x-intercepts. Wait, but earlier I had 2865. So, which is correct? Let me think carefully. When n=319, x\u22480.000997, which is within the interval. When n=3182, x\u22480.000100036, which is just above 0.0001, so included. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of terms is 3182 - 319 + 1.

Wait, but earlier I thought n=3183 would give x\u22480.0001, which is excluded, so n goes up to 3182. So, the total number is 2864. Hmm, so earlier I had 2865 because I included n=3183, which gives x=0.0001, which is not included. So, the correct count is 2864. Let me confirm with an example. Suppose I have n from a to b inclusive, the count is b - a + 1. So, if a=319, b=3182, then count=3182 - 319 +1=2864. So, that's correct.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, the substitution: x = 1/(n\u03c0). Then, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n, I get n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Yep, that seems correct.

Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. First, 1/(0.0001\u03c0) is indeed 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 3183.098. So, n must be less than that, so the maximum integer n is 3183.

Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait a minute, but I should consider whether both endpoints are included. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. So, do I need to check if x=1/(n\u03c0) equals exactly 0.0001 or 0.001 for some n? Let me see. If x=0.0001, then 1/x = 10000, so 10000 = n\u03c0 => n = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, which is not an integer. Similarly, x=0.001, 1/x=1000, so n=1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, also not an integer. So, there are no x-intercepts exactly at the endpoints, so all the x-intercepts we found with n from 319 to 3183 are strictly inside the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me think again. When n increases by 1, x decreases by a certain amount. So, the spacing between consecutive x-intercepts is x_n = 1/(n\u03c0) and x_{n+1} = 1/((n+1)\u03c0). The difference is x_n - x_{n+1} = 1/(n\u03c0) - 1/((n+1)\u03c0) = (1/(\u03c0))(1/n - 1/(n+1)) = (1/(\u03c0))( (n+1 - n)/(n(n+1)) ) = 1/(\u03c0 n(n+1)). So, the spacing decreases as n increases, which makes sense because as x approaches zero, the function oscillates more rapidly. But in our case, since we're dealing with a fixed interval, the number of zeros is determined by how many n satisfy 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which we've already found to be n from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 zeros.

The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches zero because 1/x becomes very large. So, near x = 0.0001, which is 1e-4, the function is oscillating rapidly, and as x increases towards 0.001 (which is 1e-3), the oscillations become less frequent. So, each time 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0, we get an x-intercept. So, the number of intercepts is the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 that lie between 1/0.001 and 1/0.0001. Wait, let me see: 1/x when x is 0.001 is 1000, and when x is 0.0001 is 10000. So, the values of 1/x range from 1000 to 10000. So, the number of zeros is the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. So, the smallest n where n\u03c0 >= 1000 is n >= 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n starts at 319.

So, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating those: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098. Therefore, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest is 3183. Now, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 +1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 +1 = 2865. So, 2865 intercepts. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2866. I think the confusion arises from whether 3183 is included or not. Since n must be less than 3183.098, the maximum integer n is 3183 because 3183 < 3183.098. So, yes, n=3183 is included. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Hmm, but let me check with a smaller example to make sure. Suppose I have n between 2.3 and 5.7. So, n must be greater than 2.3 and less than 5.7. So, integers n=3,4,5. That's 3 numbers. Using the formula: 5 -3 +1=3. Wait, but 5 is the upper limit. So, if upper limit is 5.7, the largest integer is 5. So, from 3 to5, inclusive, it's 3 numbers. So, formula works. Similarly, if upper limit was 5.9, still 5 is the largest integer. So, in our case, upper limit is 3183.098, so n=3183 is included. So, number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1=2865. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 3183 -318 +1=2866. That must be incorrect because 318 is less than 318.309, so the starting point is 319. So, 3183 -319 +1=2865. So, the correct number is 2865. Wait, but let me check again: 3183 -319 = 2864, then +1=2865. Yes, that's correct. So, earlier when I thought it was 2866, I was mistaken because I subtracted 318 instead of 319. So, the correct number is 2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). To find the intercepts in (0.0001, 0.001), we solve 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, leading to 318.309 < n < 3183.098. The integers n range from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

Starting with 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, taking reciprocals (and remembering that flipping inequalities when taking reciprocals because all terms are positive), we get: 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which simplifies to 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.

Let me check: 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.06) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001. Wait, no, 0.000997 is less than 0.001, so that's within the interval. Similarly, for n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) \u2248 0.0001, which is greater than 0.0001. So, both endpoints are included, so n = 319 gives x \u2248 0.000997 which is within (0.0001, 0.001), and n = 3183 gives x \u2248 0.0001, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included.

    "text": " Since n has to be an integer, n can take integer values from 319 up to 3183. Now, to find the number of integers in this range, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add one (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the lower bound for n was approximately 318.309, so the first integer n is 319. The upper bound was approximately 3183.098, so the last integer n is 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more is 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 2865 x-intercepts in that interval. But wait, let me think again. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001). So, x is approaching 0 from the right, but in this case, we're only considering x between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a very small interval near zero. The function sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely as x approaches zero, so between any two points near zero, there are infinitely many oscillations. But in our case, the interval is finite, so the number of zeros should be finite. Wait, but 2865 seems like a large number, but considering the interval is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is three orders of magnitude, and the function oscillates more as x gets smaller, it's plausible. Let me check the bounds again. Let's compute 1/(n\u03c0) for n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.37) \u2248 0.0009976, which is just below 0.001, so that's within the upper bound. For n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, which is exactly at the lower bound, but since the interval is open at 0.0001, we need to check if x = 0.0001 is included. But x = 0.0001 is 1/(10000\u03c0), which would correspond to n = 10000\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, which is not an integer, so the next integer n is 3184, but 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. Therefore, the smallest n that gives x > 0.0001 is n = 319, as previously determined. Similarly, the largest n that gives x < 0.001 is n = 3183, since 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is at the lower bound, but since the interval is open, we need to ensure that x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is indeed greater than 0.0001. Let's compute 1/(3183\u03c0): 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000.0, so 1/10000 = 0.0001. Therefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is exactly the lower bound, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), it's open at 0.0001, so x must be greater than 0.0001. Therefore, the largest n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n = 3183 - 1 = 3182. Wait, no, because if n = 3183 gives x = 0.0001, which is excluded, then the largest n that gives x > 0.0001 is n = 3182. Let me check that: 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000 - \u03c0) \u2248 approximately 0.00010003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. Therefore, n can go up to 3182. Similarly, the smallest n is 319, as before. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 = 2864. Wait, so earlier I thought it was 3183, but now I'm getting 3182 as the upper limit. So, which one is correct? Let me think carefully. The x-intercepts are at x = 1/(n\u03c0) where n is integer. We need x > 0.0001 and x < 0.001.\n\nSo, for x > 0.0001: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n\u03c0 < 10000 => n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183.\n\nBut wait, if n = 3183, then x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is exactly the lower bound, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001. So, n = 3183 gives x = 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because n = 3182 gives x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010003, which is just above 0.0001, so included.\n\nSimilarly, for x < 0.001: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so the minimum integer n is 319.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\nCompute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 = 2864.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 2865, but now it's 2864. Which is correct?\n\nLet me compute 3182 - 319:\n\n3182 - 300 = 2882\n\n2882 - 19 = 2863\n\nThen 2863 + 1 = 2864.\n\nYes, so it's 2864.\n\nWait, but let me think again: if n starts at 319 and goes up to 3182, how many terms is that?\n\nIt's like the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1.\n\nSo, 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought it was 2865 because I mistakenly included n=3183, but since n=3183 gives x=0.0001 which is excluded, we have to stop at n=3182.\n\nTherefore, the correct number is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let's take a smaller example to test.\n\nSuppose I have n from 2 to 5 inclusive. The numbers are 2,3,4,5. So, 5-2+1=4 numbers, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, if n from 319 to 3182 inclusive, it's 3182 - 319 +1=2864.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. The function y = sin(1/x) has a period of 2\u03c0 in terms of \u03b8, where \u03b8 = 1/x. So, as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001, \u03b8 increases from 1000 to 10000. So, the number of periods is (10000 - 1000)/(2\u03c0) = 9000/(2\u03c0) \u2248 1432.39. Each period has two zeros (one at the start and one in the middle), but actually, each period has one zero crossing where it goes from positive to negative or vice versa, but wait, no, actually, sin(\u03b8) has two zeros per period: at \u03b8 and \u03b8 + \u03c0. Wait, no, sin(\u03b8) has zeros at \u03b8 = n\u03c0, so between \u03b8=1000 and \u03b8=10000, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nWhich is approximately 318.309 < n < 3183.098.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so n should go up to 3182. But in terms of \u03b8, \u03b8=10000 is included in the interval \u03b8 >1000, but since x=0.0001 is excluded, \u03b8=10000 is excluded. So, the maximum \u03b8 is just below 10000, so n\u03c0 must be less than 10000, so n < 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.098, so n=3183 is excluded, so n goes up to 3182.\n\nTherefore, the number of zeros is the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 +1=2864.\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in terms of \u03b8, the number of zeros is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0) +1.\n\nWait, let me compute that: floor(10000/\u03c0)=floor(3183.098)=3183, ceil(1000/\u03c0)=ceil(318.309)=319. So, 3183 - 319 +1=2865.\n\nBut since \u03b8 must be less than 10000, which corresponds to n=3183 excluded, so we have to subtract one, making it 2864.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of it as \u03b8 from just above 1000 to just below 10000. The number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 <10000, which is equivalent to 1000/\u03c0 <n<10000/\u03c0.\n\nSo, n must be integers from 319 to 3183, but since n=3183 gives \u03b8=3183\u03c0\u224810000.0, which is excluded, so n goes up to 3182.\n\nThus, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 +1=2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. The function sin(1/x) has a zero at x=1/(n\u03c0). The interval is (0.0001, 0.001). So, x must satisfy 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) <0.001.\n\nSolving for n:\n\n1/(0.001) > n\u03c0 >1/(0.0001)\n\nWhich is 1000 >n\u03c0 >10000\n\nDividing by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 >n>10000/\u03c0\n\nWhich is approximately 318.309 <n<3183.098.\n\nSo, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nBut since x=1/(n\u03c0) must be less than 0.001, which is \u03b8=1000, and greater than 0.0001, which is \u03b8=10000.\n\nWait, no, \u03b8=1/x, so when x=0.001, \u03b8=1000, and when x=0.0001, \u03b8=10000.\n\nSo, \u03b8 ranges from 1000 to 10000.\n\nSo, the zeros occur at \u03b8=n\u03c0, where n is integer.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000 <n\u03c0<10000.\n\nThus, n must be integers such that n>1000/\u03c0\u2248318.309 and n<10000/\u03c0\u22483183.098.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nBut wait, \u03b8=10000 is excluded because x=0.0001 is excluded. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so n=3183 is excluded. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nThus, the number of integers is 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought of \u03b8 from 1000 to 10000, I considered n from 319 to 3183, which would give 2865, but since \u03b8=10000 is excluded, we have to stop at n=3182, making it 2864.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 2864.\n\nBut let me think again: if I have \u03b8 from 1000 to just below 10000, then n can go up to floor((10000 - \u03b5)/\u03c0), where \u03b5 is a small positive number. So, floor(10000/\u03c0)=3183, but since \u03b8 must be less than 10000, n must be less than 3183.098, so n=3183 is excluded.\n\nTherefore, the number of n's is from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, after all that, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) has x-intercepts where \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\), which occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for integer \\( n \\).

Wait, let me check that calculation again. 3183 - 318 is 2865, and adding 1 gives 2866.

Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the values: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Wait, let me double-check that subtraction: 3183 - 319. Let's see, 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. So, 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, that suggests there are 2865 integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. But wait a second, I should make sure that 1/(319\u03c0) is indeed greater than 0.0001 and 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.001.

Now, for n=3183: 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000.0) = 0.0001. Wait, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.0001. So, x must be greater than 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001, meaning n must be less than 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n can be up to 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, which is the lower bound of the interval, but since the interval is open at 0.0001, does x=1/(3183\u03c0) count? Wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but let me compute it more accurately. Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0: 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.0415926535 \u2248 approx 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, and 3183 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 approx 5.06. So adding up: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.06 \u2248 450.68. So total 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 9549 + 450.68 \u2248 10,000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 exactly. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.0001, does that mean x=0.0001 is excluded? So, 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001, so n must be less than 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So n can be up to 3183 because 3183 < 3183.098. So, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n should be 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) would be slightly greater than 0.0001. Let me check that: 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 Let's compute 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77, 182 * \u03c0 \u2248 571.58. So total \u2248 9424.77 + 571.58 \u2248 10,000. So, 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 10,000 - \u03c0 \u2248 10,000 - 3.1416 \u2248 9996.8584. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.8584 \u2248 0.00010003, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. So, n can be from 319 up to 3183, but wait, n=3183 gives x=0.0001 exactly, which is excluded, so the maximum n is 3182. So, now, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3182. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 is 2864. Wait, earlier I thought it was 2865, but now I'm getting 2864. Let me check again. If n starts at 319 and ends at 3182, inclusive, then the number of terms is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863. Then, 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, that's 2864 integers. But wait, earlier when I thought n went up to 3183, I got 2865, but since n=3183 is excluded, it's 2864. Wait, but let me make sure. Let's take a smaller example. Suppose n starts at 2 and ends at 4. The numbers are 2,3,4. So, 4 - 2 +1 = 3 numbers. Correct. So, applying that, 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864. So, 2864 x-intercepts. But wait, let me double-check the bounds again. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001). So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) must be in (0.0001, 0.001). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let's solve for n again. From 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, so n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So n must be less than 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but when n=3183, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded. So, n can be up to 3182. Similarly, from 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, so n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, n starts at 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, number of terms is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864. So, that's 2864 x-intercepts. But wait, let me check if n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.0) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. And n=3182 gives x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(9996.8584) \u2248 0.00010003, which is just above 0.0001, so included. So, all n from 319 to 3182 inclusive give x in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865, but since n=3183 is excluded, it's 2864. So, the answer should be 2864. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the subtraction. 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 is 2864. Yes, that's correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0).

Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, actually, let me think again. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check that. Sometimes when dealing with inequalities, especially with reciprocals, I might have made a mistake in the direction of the inequalities. Let me verify the steps again. Starting with x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), substituting gives 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and remembering that reversing the inequalities because reciprocals flip the order for positive numbers): 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing through by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating these, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098.

Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 integer values of n, which correspond to 2865 x-intercepts in the given interval. Wait, let me double-check that calculation. If n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183, inclusive, then the number of terms is 3183 - 318 = 2865? Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, if a is 319 and b is 3183, then it's 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. Yes, that's correct. So, there are 2865 x-intercepts. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial inequalities. Let me re-express the inequalities step by step. Given 0.0001 < x < 0.001, and x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let's solve for n in each inequality. Starting with the left inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Taking reciprocals (and remembering that flipping the inequality when taking reciprocals because all terms are positive): 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. So, 10000 > n\u03c0, which gives n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183.\n\nNow, the right inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001 = 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, the smallest integer n is 319.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nWait, 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that's correct.\n\nBut let me just confirm this with an example. Suppose n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.77) \u2248 0.000997, which is just under 0.001, so it's within the interval. Similarly, n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.1) \u2248 0.00009999, which is just above 0.0001, so it's within the interval. So, both endpoints are included, and the count is 2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the initial substitution. Is x = 1/(n\u03c0) the correct substitution? Yes, because sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0, so 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). That seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the function sin(1/x) near zero. As x approaches zero from the positive side, 1/x approaches positive infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is between 10^{-4} and 10^{-3}, the function sin(1/x) will oscillate between -1 and 1, crossing the x-axis each time 1/x passes through an integer multiple of \u03c0. So, each x-intercept corresponds to 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). Therefore, the number of such x in (0.0001, 0.001) is the number of integers n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which is exactly what I calculated earlier. So, I think my approach is correct.\n\nLet me just recap the steps:\n\n1. Recognize that sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0).\n\n2. Determine the range of x: 0.0001 < x < 0.001.\n\n3. Substitute x = 1/(n\u03c0) into the inequalities to find the range of n.\n\n4. Solve for n in both inequalities to find n must be between approximately 318.309 and 3183.098.\n\n5. Since n must be an integer, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\n6. Calculate the number of integers in this range: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me check with a specific example. Let's take n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.77) \u2248 0.000997, which is approximately 0.001, but slightly less, so it's within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.1) \u2248 0.00009999, which is just above 0.0001, so it's also within the interval. So, both ends are included, and the count is correct.\n\nAnother thing to consider: sometimes when dealing with inequalities and reciprocals, it's easy to flip the inequality sign incorrectly, but since all terms are positive, taking reciprocals does flip the inequality. So, for example, if a < b, then 1/a > 1/b when a and b are positive. So, that part was handled correctly.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The key was recognizing that each x-intercept corresponds to a specific n, and then determining the range of n that places x within the given interval. The calculation seems solid, so I'm confident that the answer is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe number of x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is determined by finding the integer values of n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) falls within the interval. \n\n1. **Identify x-intercepts**: sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0).\n2. **Set up inequalities**: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n3. **Solve for n**:\n   - Lower bound: n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 \u21d2 n starts at 319.\n   - Upper bound: n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098 \u21d2 n ends at 3183.\n4. **Count integers**: The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n**Answer**: The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

Second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u21d2 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 \u21d2 n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, n must be an integer greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098. Therefore, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the function y = sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely as x approaches 0, but in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is quite close to zero, the function still oscillates a lot, leading to many x-intercepts. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) has x-intercepts where \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\). This occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for integer \\( n \\), so \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).

    "text": " But n has to be an integer, so n starts from the next integer after 318.309, which is 319, and goes up to the integer just below 3183.098, which is 3183. So, the possible values of n are integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers in this range, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me calculate that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as n starting at 319 and ending at 3183. So, the number of terms is 3183 - 318 = 2865. Hmm, same result. But wait, let me verify the initial inequalities again. When x is in (0.0001, 0.001), 1/x is in (1000, 10000). So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. Therefore, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000. So, n must be between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0. Calculating those: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Thus, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that's correct. But let me think again: when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.7) \u2248 0.000997, which is just below 0.001, so it's within the interval. Similarly, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, which is just above 0.0001, so also within the interval. Therefore, each integer n from 319 to 3183 corresponds to an x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, 2864 +1 = 2865. So, the answer should be 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. Thus, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, leading to n between approximately 318.31 and 3183.09. The integers n from 319 to 3183 inclusive give the x-intercepts, totaling 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"
