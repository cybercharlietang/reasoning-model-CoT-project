    "text": " n < 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) Similarly, for the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) So, putting it all together, we have: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) < n < 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) Let me compute these values numerically to find the range of n. First, compute 1 / (0.001\u03c0): 0.001 is 10^-3, so 1 / (10^-3 * \u03c0) = 10^3 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, compute 1 / (0.0001\u03c0): 0.0001 is 10^-4, so 1 / (10^-4 * \u03c0) = 10^4 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1416 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.309886 and less than approximately 3183.09886. Since n has to be an integer, n can take integer values starting from the next integer after 318.309886, which is 319, up to the integer just below 3183.09886, which is 3183. Now, to find how many integers are in this range from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is given by b - a + 1. So, plugging in the values: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 = 2864; 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. Wait, 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial setup. So, x = 1/(n\u03c0) must lie between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which leads to 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0). Calculating 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31, and 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886. So, n must be greater than 318.31 and less than 3183.09886. Therefore, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest is 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864; 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, that suggests there are 2865 x-intercepts. Wait a minute, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because as x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. So, between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a very small interval near zero, the function sin(1/x) oscillates a huge number of times, leading to a large number of zeros. But 2865 seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again. So, 1/(0.001\u03c0) is approximately 318.31, so n must be greater than this, so n starts at 319. 1/(0.0001\u03c0) is approximately 3183.09886, so n must be less than this, so the maximum n is 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 is 2865. So, 2865 is the number of zeros. Wait, but let me think about whether this counts all the zeros correctly. Each time n increases by 1, we get another zero crossing. So, each integer n in that range corresponds to exactly one x-intercept. So, if n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, that should be correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, sometimes when dealing with intervals, especially when dealing with functions that oscillate, you might have to consider whether the endpoints are included, but in this case, the interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), so we don't include the endpoints. However, since x = 1/(n\u03c0) must lie strictly between 0.0001 and 0.001, we're correctly excluding n such that x equals exactly 0.0001 or 0.001, which would correspond to n = 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.09886 and n = 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309886. Since n must be integers, the next integer above 318.309886 is 319, and the integer below 3183.09886 is 3183. So, that's correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0, i.e., at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. To find the number of such x in (0.0001, 0.001), we solve 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, leading to 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0). Calculating these bounds gives n ranging from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

    "text": " n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) Let me compute that: 1/(0.0001) is 10000, so 1/(0.0001\u03c0) is approximately 10000/3.1416 \u2248 3183.098. So, n < approximately 3183.098. Since n is an integer, the maximum possible n here is 3183. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) Calculating that: 1/0.001 is 1000, so 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 1000/3.1416 \u2248 318.309. So, n > approximately 318.309. Since n is an integer, the minimum possible n here is 319. So, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the numbers: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems too high. Let me double-check my calculations. Hmm, 3183 - 319 is actually 2864, but adding 1 gives 2865. But wait, let me think again. Is that correct? Let me take a smaller example to verify. Suppose I have numbers from 5 to 10 inclusive. 10 - 5 = 5, plus 1 is 6, which is correct (5,6,7,8,9,10). So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, from 319 to 3183 inclusive, there are 2865 integers. But wait a second, let me check if n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0). Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0). Since \u03c0\u22483.1416, 3183\u03c0\u22483183*3.1416\u224810000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is the lower bound of the interval. But our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, meaning it doesn't include the endpoints. So, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, which is excluded. Similarly, n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0). Let's compute that: 319\u03c0\u2248319*3.1416\u22481003. So, 1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.000996, which is approximately 0.001, but slightly less, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but 0.000996 is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, n=319 gives x\u22480.000996, which is in the interval. Similarly, n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001, which is excluded. So, n can go from 319 up to 3182. Let me recalculate the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Using the same formula: 3182 - 319 + 1 = 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, there are 2864 integers. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but since n=3183 is excluded, it's actually 2864. Let me confirm with the example again. If I have numbers from 5 to 9 inclusive, that's 5,6,7,8,9, which is 5 numbers. 9 -5 =4, plus 1 is 5. So, correct. So, in our case, from 319 to 3182 inclusive, the count is 3182 -319 +1 = 2864. Therefore, there are 2864 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial step. So, x must be in (0.0001, 0.001), which is equivalent to 1/x being in (1000, 10000). Because taking reciprocals reverses the inequality. So, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, 1/x = n\u03c0, so n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000. Therefore, n must be between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute those: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.098. So, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183, but since 1/x must be less than 10000, n\u03c0 <10000, so n <10000/\u03c0\u22483183.098, so n can be up to 3183. But wait, if n=3183, then 1/x=3183\u03c0\u224810000, so x\u22480.0001, which is excluded. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because 3182\u03c0\u22483182*3.1416\u224810000 - let's compute 3183\u03c0\u224810000, so 3182\u03c0\u224810000 - \u03c0\u224810000 -3.1416\u22489996.8584. So, 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22481/9996.8584\u22480.00010003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, that can't be right because 1/(3182\u03c0) is approximately 0.00010003, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. So, n can go up to 3182. Therefore, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 -319 +1=2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but let me check with n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22481/(3182*3.1416)=1/(10000 - \u03c0)= approximately 0.00010003, which is just above 0.0001, so included. And n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22481/(1003)\u22480.000997, which is just below 0.001, so included. So, the total number is 2864. Therefore, the answer is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 1/(n\u03c0) must be between 0.0001 and 0.001. Solving for n gives n between approximately 319 and 3182. The number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\n\\boxed{2864}"

Since n is an integer, n \u2264 3183. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.3098862.

The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, substituting a = 319 and b = 3183: Number of intercepts = 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Wait, let me check that subtraction again. 3183 - 300 is 2883, and then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 x-intercepts in that interval. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. So, 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, when n increases, 1/(n\u03c0) decreases. So, the smallest n is when 1/(n\u03c0) is just above 0.001, which is n just above 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.3098862, so n=319. The largest n is when 1/(n\u03c0) is just below 0.0001, so n just below 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988618, so n=3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 is 2865. So, that's 2865 intercepts. Hmm, but I should also consider whether 1/(n\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001 or 0.001, but since the interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), we don't include the endpoints. So, we don't have to worry about n making 1/(n\u03c0) equal to exactly 0.0001 or 0.001, which would happen if 0.0001 or 0.001 were exact multiples of 1/(n\u03c0). But since \u03c0 is irrational, 0.0001 and 0.001 are not exact multiples of 1/(n\u03c0) for integer n, so our range for n is correct.

So, n > approximately 318.3098. Since n must be an integer, n must satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Wait, let me check that. The first inequality gives n < ~3183.098, so the largest integer n can be is 3183. The second inequality gives n > ~318.3098, so the smallest integer n can be is 319. Therefore, n ranges from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, no, let's see: from 319 to 3183, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there should be 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's verify the bounds again. For n=319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.73) \u2248 0.000997, which is just under 0.001, so it's within the interval. For n=3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, which is exactly at 0.0001, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001. Hmm, so n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but is that greater than 0.0001? Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0): 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000.0 (since 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000). So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since 3183 * \u03c0 is slightly more than 10000, because \u03c0 is approximately 3.14159265, so 3183 * 3.14159265 = let's compute that more accurately. 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.14159265 \u2248 3183 * 0.14 = 445.62, and 3183 * 0.00159265 \u2248 5.06. So total is approximately 9549 + 445.62 + 5.06 \u2248 9999.68. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.68, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.68 \u2248 0.0001000032, which is just slightly above 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000032, which is indeed greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 is included. Similarly, n=319 gives x \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Now, let's check n=318: x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.0) \u2248 0.001, but 318\u03c0 \u2248 318*3.1416 \u2248 1000.0, so x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.001, but since the interval is open at 0.001, x must be less than 0.001. So, 1/(318\u03c0) is exactly 0.001 when 318\u03c0=1000, but \u03c0 is irrational, so 318\u03c0 is not exactly 1000, but let's compute 318*3.14159265: 318*3=954, 318*0.14159265\u224845.0. So, 318\u03c0\u2248999.0, so 1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.001001, which is just above 0.001, so it's outside the interval. Therefore, n=318 gives x\u22480.001001, which is greater than 0.001, so it's excluded. Therefore, n starts at 319. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial substitution. When I set sin(1/x) = 0, I got 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). That's correct. Then, substituting into 0.0001 < x < 0.001, we get 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities because reciprocals reverse the order for positive numbers), we get 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating those: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be integers greater than 318.3098 and less than 3183.098. Therefore, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the arithmetic again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, and 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, yes, 2865 is the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nIs there any chance I missed something? Let me think. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is very close to 0, the function oscillates rapidly. Each oscillation corresponds to a period of 2\u03c0 in the argument of the sine function, which is 1/x. So, the number of oscillations between x = a and x = b is roughly (1/a - 1/b)/(2\u03c0). But wait, that might be another way to compute the number of zeros. Let me try that approach to see if I get the same answer.\n\nThe number of zeros of sin(1/x) between x = a and x = b is equal to the number of times 1/x crosses an integer multiple of \u03c0 as x decreases from b to a. So, the number of zeros N is the number of integers n such that 1/b < n\u03c0 < 1/a. So, N = floor(1/a / \u03c0) - ceil(1/b / \u03c0). Let me compute that.\n\nGiven a = 0.0001 and b = 0.001, then 1/a = 10000, and 1/b = 1000. So, 1/a / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1416 \u2248 3183.098, and 1/b / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.3098.\n\nSo, floor(3183.098) = 3183, and ceil(318.3098) = 319. Therefore, N = 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that's the same as before. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, the number of zeros is approximately the difference between 1/a and 1/b divided by \u03c0, but since each zero occurs every \u03c0 in the argument, so the number of zeros is roughly (1/a - 1/b)/\u03c0. Let's compute that: (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 = 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.197. Hmm, that's close to 2865, but not exactly the same. The difference is due to the fact that we're dealing with integers and the endpoints. So, the exact count is 2865, which matches our earlier result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0, i.e., x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. Within the interval (0.0001, 0.001), we find the range of n by solving 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, leading to n between 319 and 3183. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

    "text": " n < 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) Let me compute that. 1 / 0.0001 is 10000, so 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n is an integer, n \u2264 3183.\n\nNow, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) Calculating that, 1 / 0.001 is 1000, so 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618. Since n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618, and n is an integer, n \u2265 319.\n\nSo, putting it all together, n must satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, substituting the values: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n in this range, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts in the given interval. Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. Let me recalculate the bounds for n. For the lower bound: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988618, so n \u2264 3183. For the upper bound: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.30988618, so n \u2265 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Now, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and 2864 + 1 is 2865. So, that seems correct. But wait, let me check with specific examples. Let's take n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.13) \u2248 0.000998, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Now, n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10001.1) \u2248 0.00009999, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's also within the interval. Now, let me check n = 3184: x = 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10004.2) \u2248 0.00009996, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. Similarly, n = 318: x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1001.0) \u2248 0.000999, which is greater than 0.001, so it's outside the interval. So, n must be from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 2865 intercepts. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to n ranging from 319 to 3183, resulting in 2865 x-intercepts.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

Since n must be an integer, n can be at most 3183. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) Let me compute that: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1 / (\u03c0 * 10^-3) = 10^3 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.3098 So, n > approximately 318.3098. Since n must be an integer, n must be at least 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, to find the number of integers in this range, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add one (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. First, 1/(0.0001\u03c0) is indeed 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988, so n must be less than that, so n_max = 3183. Then, 1/(0.001\u03c0) is 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098, so n_min = 319. So, the number of n's is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2865. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me think again. Each n corresponds to a unique x in the interval. So, each integer n from 319 to 3183 inclusive gives an x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, yes, the count is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. But wait, let me confirm if x=1/(n\u03c0) is indeed within (0.0001, 0.001) for n=319 and n=3183. For n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1004.12) \u2248 0.000996, which is just above 0.0001, so yes. For n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) \u2248 0.0001, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001. Wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) \u2248 0.0001, but 0.0001 is the lower bound, which is excluded. So, x must be greater than 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988, so n can be up to 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010001, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. Similarly, for n=319, x\u22480.000996, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Therefore, the count is indeed 2865. Wait, but let me think about the endpoints. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. So, x must satisfy 0.0001 < x < 0.001. So, for x=1/(n\u03c0) to be in this interval, we need 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Which translates to n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.3098 and n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Solving for x gives x = 1/(n\u03c0). To find x in (0.0001, 0.001), we determine the range of n:\n\n1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0), which simplifies to 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183.

Since n is an integer, the maximum possible n here is 3183.\n\nNow, let's look at the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, solving for n: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) Calculating that: 1 / 0.001 is 1000, so n > 1000 / \u03c0. 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 318.30988618.

Now, let's find how many integers are in this range. To find the number of integers from a to b inclusive, it's b - a + 1. So, plugging in the numbers: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n in this range, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, starting with the inequalities:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nWhich translates to:\n\n1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0)\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nCalculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618.\n\nSo, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the endpoints again. When n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.85) \u2248 0.000996, which is approximately 0.001, but just a bit less, so it's within the interval (0.0001, 0.001).

Therefore, the count is indeed 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The function sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches zero, and between any two points near zero, it has infinitely many oscillations. But in this specific interval, which is between 0.0001 and 0.001, it's a finite interval, so the number of zeros should be finite. The reasoning using n being from 319 to 3183 seems correct because each n corresponds to a zero crossing at x = 1/(n\u03c0), and those x's lie within (0.0001, 0.001). So, I think 2865 is the correct number of x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me check if 3183\u03c0 is exactly 10000.0 or not. Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0. 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, and 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 575.1766, so total is approximately 9424.77796 + 575.1766 \u2248 10,000. So, 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10,000, which makes 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound of the interval. Similarly, 319\u03c0 is approximately 1003.85, so 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000996, which is just under 0.001. So, yes, both endpoints are included.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) which is just above 0.0001. Let me compute 1/(3183 * \u03c0). Since \u03c0 \u2248 3.1415926535, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 10,000. So, 1/10,000 is 0.0001 exactly. But since 3183 * \u03c0 is slightly more than 10,000, 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001. Wait, that would mean x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is just below 0.0001, which would be outside the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, so maybe n=3183 gives x just below 0.0001, so it's not included. Then, the maximum n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 would be n=3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 exactly, but since it's just over 0.0001, maybe n=3183 is included. Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me compute 1/(3183 * \u03c0) more accurately.\n\nLet me compute 3183 * \u03c0. Let's compute 3183 * 3.1415926535.\n\nCompute 3000 * \u03c0 = 9424.77796077\n\nCompute 183 * \u03c0: 183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 183 * 3 = 549, 183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 25.956, so total \u2248 549 + 25.956 \u2248 574.956\n\nSo, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796077 + 574.956 \u2248 10,000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000 exactly? Wait, that can't be because \u03c0 is irrational. So, 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10,000 but not exactly. Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0 more accurately.\n\nCompute 3183 * \u03c0:\n\nLet me use a calculator approach:\n\n\u03c0 \u2248 3.141592653589793\n\nSo, 3183 * 3.141592653589793:\n\nLet me compute 3000 * \u03c0 = 9424.77796076938\n\n183 * \u03c0: Let's compute 180 * \u03c0 = 565.486677646244, and 3 * \u03c0 \u2248 9.42477796076938\n\nSo, 565.486677646244 + 9.42477796076938 \u2248 574.9114556070134\n\nSo, total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796076938 + 574.9114556070134 \u2248 10,000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000.0000000000004? Wait, that seems too precise. Wait, actually, 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10,000, but not exactly. So, 3183\u03c0 is just a bit more than 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is just a bit less than 0.0001. Therefore, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is just below 0.0001, which is outside our interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 would give x just below 0.0001, which is excluded. So, the maximum n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3182.\n\nWait, let me check n=3182: 3182\u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 ?\n\nCompute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796077\n\n182\u03c0 \u2248 182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 182 * 3 = 546, 182 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 25.809, so total \u2248 546 + 25.809 \u2248 571.809\n\nSo, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796077 + 571.809 \u2248 9996.587, so 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.587 \u2248 0.000100034, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. So, n=3182 gives x\u22480.000100034, which is within (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nSimilarly, n=3183 gives x\u22481/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10000 \u2248 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10,000, x is slightly less than 0.0001, which is outside the interval. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nSimilarly, the minimum n is 319, as before, because 318\u03c0 \u2248 1000, so 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.001, but let me check n=318: 318\u03c0 \u2248 1000. So, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.001, but let's compute it accurately.\n\n318\u03c0 \u2248 318 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 1000.0000000000005, so 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009999999999999995, which is just under 0.001, so included in the interval. So, n=318 gives x\u22480.0009999999999999995, which is just under 0.001, so included. Wait, but earlier I thought n starts at 319. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, earlier I had 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, so n must be greater than that, so the smallest integer n is 319. But wait, if n=318 gives x\u22480.001, which is the upper limit, but the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.001, so x=0.001 is not included. Therefore, n=318 gives x\u22480.0009999999999999995, which is just under 0.001, so it's included. Wait, so maybe n starts at 318? Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, let's clarify. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so it doesn't include 0.0001 and 0.001. So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, for n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009999999999999995, which is just under 0.001, so it's included. For n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000996..., which is still under 0.001. So, the maximum n is 3182, as earlier, because n=3182 gives x\u22480.000100034, which is just over 0.0001, included in the interval. n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001, which is the lower bound, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so n=3183 is excluded.\n\nSo, n starts at 318 (since n=318 gives x\u22480.001, but just under, so included) and goes up to n=3182 (which gives x\u22480.000100034, just over 0.0001, so included). Therefore, the number of integers from 318 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 318 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that's the same as before, but now I'm including n=318, which I didn't before. Hmm, but earlier I thought n starts at 319 because 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, so n must be greater than that, so the next integer is 319. But if n=318 gives x\u22480.0009999999999999995, which is just under 0.001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=318 should be included.\n\nWait, perhaps my initial calculation was wrong. Let me recast the inequalities:\n\nWe have 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDivide all parts by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nCalculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618\n\n10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618\n\nTherefore, n must be greater than 318.30988618 and less than 3183.0988618.\n\nSince n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nWait, but earlier when I took n=318, I saw that x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009999999999999995, which is just under 0.001, so included in the interval. But according to this, n must be greater than 318.30988618, so n starts at 319. So, why is there a discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the inequalities. Let me check again.\n\nStarting from 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nTaking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities because reciprocating positive numbers reverses the inequality):\n\n1/0.001 > n\u03c0 > 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000 > n\u03c0 > 10000\n\nWait, that can't be right because 1000 > n\u03c0 > 10000 is impossible since 1000 < 10000. Wait, I must have messed up the reciprocals. Let me do it carefully.\n\nStarting with 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nTaking reciprocals, remembering that reciprocating inequalities reverses them:\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nWhich is approximately:\n\n318.30988618 < n < 3183.0988618\n\nSo, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618 and less than approximately 3183.0988618. Therefore, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest integer n is 3183.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\n2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nSo, there are 2865 integers n in that range, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that n=318 gives x\u22480.001, which is just under 0.001, so it's included in the interval. But according to the inequalities, n must be greater than 318.30988618, so n=319 is the first integer. So, perhaps n=318 is excluded because 318 < 318.30988618. So, n=318 would give 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009999999999999995, which is less than 0.001, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.30988618, so n=318 is less than that, so it's excluded. Therefore, n starts at 319.\n\nSimilarly, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, which gives x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100034, which is just above 0.0001, so included.\n\nWait, so now I'm confused because earlier I thought n goes up to 3183, but now I'm thinking it goes up to 3182.\n\nWait, let's recast the problem.\n\nWe have 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\n1/(0.001) < n\u03c0 < 1/(0.0001)\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nWhich is approximately:\n\n318.30988618 < n < 3183.0988618\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.30988618 and less than 3183.0988618.\n\nTherefore, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest integer n is 3183, because 3183 < 3183.0988618, so 3183 is included.\n\nWait, but 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10,000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound of the interval, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001. Therefore, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 is excluded, so n=3183 is excluded.\n\nTherefore, the maximum n is 3182, because 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9996.587, so 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100034, which is just above 0.0001, so included.\n\nSimilarly, the minimum n is 319, because 319\u03c0 \u2248 1003.85, so 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000996, which is just under 0.001, so included.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n3182 - 319 = 2863\n\n2863 + 1 = 2864\n\nSo, there are 2864 integers n in that range, meaning 2864 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but now it's 2864. Which is correct?\n\nWait, let's compute 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\n3182 - 319 = 2863\n\n2863 + 1 = 2864\n\nSo, 2864.\n\nBut earlier, when I took n from 319 to 3183, it was 2865, but since n=3183 is excluded, it's 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check n=3183: 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so n=3183 is excluded.\n\nSimilarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.000996, which is just under 0.001, so included.\n\nTherefore, n starts at 319 and ends at 3182, giving 2864 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me check with actual numbers.\n\nCompute 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\n3182 - 319 = 2863\n\n2863 + 1 = 2864\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought it was 2865 because I included n=3183, but now I see that n=3183 is excluded because x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 is excluded from the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nTherefore, the correct number is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with n=3182 and n=319.\n\nn=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.85) \u2248 0.000996, which is less than 0.001, so included.\n\nn=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(9996.587) \u2248 0.000100034, which is greater than 0.0001, so included.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but now I'm getting 2864. Which is correct?\n\nLet me take a small example to verify. Suppose I have n from 3 to 5 inclusive. That's 3,4,5: three numbers. 5 - 3 + 1 = 3.\n\nSimilarly, from 3 to 4 inclusive: 3,4: two numbers. 4 - 3 + 1 = 2.\n\nSo, applying that, from 319 to 3182 inclusive: 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but now I'm convinced it's 2864.\n\nWait, let me check with another approach. The number of zeros of sin(1/x) between x=a and x=b is equal to the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is between a and b. So, in this case, a=0.0001, b=0.001.\n\nSo, the number of n's is the number of integers n satisfying 1/(0.001) < n\u03c0 < 1/(0.0001), which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.30988618 < n < 3183.0988618.\n\nSo, the number of integers n is floor(3183.0988618) - ceil(318.30988618) + 1.\n\nfloor(3183.0988618) = 3183\n\nceil(318.30988618) = 319\n\nSo, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded because the interval is (0.0001, 0.001). So, should I subtract 1?\n\nWait, no, because 3183 is less than 3183.0988618, so 3183 is included in the range. But x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 is the lower bound, which is excluded because the interval is open. Therefore, n=3183 should not be counted.\n\nTherefore, the correct count is floor(3183.0988618) - 1 - ceil(318.30988618) + 1 = 3183 - 1 - 319 + 1 = 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but that seems convoluted. Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be floor(upper) - ceil(lower) + 1, but if the endpoint is excluded, we need to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct count is floor(upper_bound) - ceil(lower_bound).\n\nIn this case, upper_bound = 3183.0988618, so floor(upper_bound) = 3183\n\nlower_bound = 318.30988618, ceil(lower_bound) = 319\n\nSo, 3183 - 319 = 2864\n\nTherefore, the number of integers is 2864.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that n=3183 is included because 3183 < 3183.0988618, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 is excluded, so n=3183 should not be counted. Therefore, the count is 3183 - 1 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 2864 x-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Solving for x gives x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nThis implies:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618\n\nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3183. However, since x must be greater than 0.0001, n=3183 is excluded, leaving n from 319 to 3182. The number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\n\\boxed{2864}"

First, 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) = 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.14159265 \u2248 3183.09886. So, n < approximately 3183.09886. Similarly, 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.14159265 \u2248 318.309886. So, n > approximately 318.309886. Since n has to be an integer, n must be greater than 318.309886 and less than 3183.09886. Therefore, n can take integer values from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to count how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the values: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 = 2864; 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n in that range, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait a minute, let me double-check that calculation to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 3183 - 319: Let's compute 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that makes sense because as x approaches zero from the right, 1/x becomes very large, and sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. So, between 0.0001 and 0.001, which are both close to zero, the function will cross the x-axis a large number of times. Each time 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0, which happens every \u03c0 interval in the argument of the sine function. So, the number of zeros should correspond to how many times 1/x crosses these multiples of \u03c0 in the given interval. Yep, that seems to check out.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. This translates to x = 1/(n\u03c0). For x in (0.0001, 0.001), we find that n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

First, let's compute 1/(0.001\u03c0). 0.001 is 10^-3, so 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 10^3 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let me calculate that: 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 318.309886184. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184. Since n is an integer, n must be at least 319. Next, let's compute 1/(0.0001\u03c0). 0.0001 is 10^-4, so 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10^4 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let me compute that: 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 3183.09886184. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n is an integer, the largest n can be is 3183. Therefore, n ranges from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers in this range, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, number of x-intercepts = 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, and then adding 1 gives 2865. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. Wait, 3183 - 319 is actually 2864, right? Because 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more gives 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, that's correct. So, there are 2865 x-intercepts in that interval. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial substitution. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001). So, x is between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000, because 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which leads to 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 gives 2865. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0).

Since n must be greater than this, the smallest integer n can be is 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers in this range, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add one (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.3098, so n starts at 319. Then, n < 3183.0988, so n goes up to 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Yep, that seems correct. So, the function y = sin(1/x) crosses the x-axis 2865 times between 0.0001 and 0.001.\n</think>\n\nThe function \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) has x-intercepts where \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\), leading to \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\). Within the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), the integer \\( n \\) ranges from 319 to 3183, resulting in 2865 intercepts.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

    "text": " n < 1 / (0.0001\u03c0). Let me compute 1 / (0.0001\u03c0). 0.0001 is 10^-4, so 1 / (10^-4 \u03c0) = 10^4 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1416 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n < approximately 3183.0988618. Since n must be an integer, the maximum n can be is 3183. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let's solve for n. Multiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, divide both sides by 0.001\u03c0: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) < n. Calculating 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1 / (\u03c0 * 0.001) = 1 / (0.00314159265) \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618. Since n is an integer, the smallest n can be is 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Let's compute that: 3183 - 318 = 2865. Then, 2865 + 1 = 2866. So, there are 2866 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2866 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with the inequalities: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n, I correctly inverted the inequalities when taking reciprocals, remembering that inverting reverses the inequality. So, n must be between 1/(0.001\u03c0) and 1/(0.0001\u03c0), which is 318.30988618 < n < 3183.0988618. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake here. Earlier, I subtracted 318 from 3183, but actually, since n starts at 319, which is 318 + 1, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, so I think I made an error earlier when I thought the number was 2866. Let me correct that. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Therefore, the correct number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me verify this again. Let's take a small example. Suppose n starts at 3 and ends at 5. The numbers are 3,4,5. So, 5 - 3 + 1 = 3 numbers. That works. So, applying that to our case: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, the correct number is 2865. I must have miscalculated earlier when I thought it was 2866. So, the final answer is 2865 x-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we determine where \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\).

    "text": " n < 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) Let me compute that: 1 / 0.0001 is 10,000, so 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) = 10,000 / \u03c0 \u2248 10,000 / 3.1416 \u2248 3183.098862. So, n < approximately 3183.098862. Similarly, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) Let's compute that: 1 / 0.001 is 1000, so 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.3098862. So, n > approximately 318.3098862. Since n has to be an integer, n must be greater than 318.3098862, so the smallest integer n is 319. And n must be less than approximately 3183.098862, so the largest integer n is 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers n are there from 319 to 3183, inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers, I can subtract the smaller from the larger and add 1. So, number of x-intercepts = 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 x-intercepts in that interval. Wait, but I should double-check if both endpoints are included correctly. The interval for x is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. So, I need to make sure that the corresponding n values don't result in x being exactly at those endpoints. Let me check for n=318: x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.86) \u2248 0.00099914, which is just below 0.001. But wait, 0.00099914 is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Wait, no, 0.00099914 is 0.00099914, which is 0.00099914, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. But since n starts at 319, the x is 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.0) \u2248 0.000997, which is still within (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but wait, 1/(318\u03c0) is approximately 0.00099914, which is less than 0.001, so it's still within the interval. But since n starts at 319, does that mean n=318 is excluded? Wait, earlier, we found that n must be greater than approximately 318.309, so n starts at 319. So, n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099914, which is less than 0.001, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, does that mean x cannot be exactly 0.001 or 0.0001, but can approach them? Wait, but 1/(318\u03c0) is approximately 0.00099914, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Hmm, but since n must be greater than 318.309, n starts at 319, so n=318 is not included, so x=1/(318\u03c0) is not included because n must be greater than 318.309, so n=319 is the first integer. Similarly, for the upper bound, n must be less than 3183.0988, so n=3183 is included because 3183 < 3183.0988. So, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, but since the interval is open, x=0.0001 is excluded. Wait, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 1/(10000) = 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. So, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001. Therefore, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 is excluded. So, n=3183 would give x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is not included, so the largest n is 3182. Wait, that contradicts my earlier calculation. Let me think carefully. If n must satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, then n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988. So, n can be up to 3183, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001. So, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but it's actually slightly less than 0.0001 because 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001. Therefore, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's not included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the largest n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3182. Let me check: 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000 - \u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.52 \u2248 0.000100035, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. So, n can go up to 3182. Similarly, for the lower bound, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=319 is the first integer. Therefore, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 gives 2864. So, there are 2864 x-intercepts. Wait, earlier I thought it was 2865, but now I'm getting 2864. Which one is correct? Let me recast the problem. The interval for x is (0.0001, 0.001). So, x must satisfy 0.0001 < x < 0.001. So, substituting x=1/(n\u03c0), we get 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let's solve for n in each inequality.\n\nFirst inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) \u21d2 n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001 \u21d2 n\u03c0 < 10000 \u21d2 n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098862. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.098862, so the maximum integer n is 3183.\n\nSecond inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u21d2 n\u03c0 > 1/0.001 \u21d2 n\u03c0 > 1000 \u21d2 n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098862. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.3098862, so the minimum integer n is 319.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 is 2865. Wait, but earlier I thought that n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but the interval is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001. So, does n=3183 give x=1/(3183\u03c0) which is less than 0.0001? Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's compute 3000*3.1416=9424.8, 183*3.1416\u2248183*3=549, 183*0.1416\u224825.99, so total \u2248549+25.99\u2248574.99, so total \u22489424.8 + 574.99\u22489999.79. So, 3183\u03c0 \u22489999.79, so 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22481/9999.79\u22480.0001000025. So, that's approximately 0.0001000025, which is just slightly above 0.0001. So, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001000025, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 is included. Similarly, n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22481/(1003.14)\u22480.0009968, which is less than 0.001, so it's included as well.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, but it's actually slightly more than 0.0001, so it's included. So, n=3183 is included, so the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought that 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is the lower bound, and since the interval is open, it's excluded, but actually, 1/(3183\u03c0) is just above 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, n=3183 is included, so the count is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check with specific numbers. Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0). Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0:\n\n\u03c0 \u22483.1415926535\n\n3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248\n\nLet me compute 3000 * \u03c0 \u22489424.77796\n\n183 * \u03c0 \u2248183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248\n\n180 * \u03c0 \u2248565.48667\n\n3 * \u03c0 \u22489.42477796\n\nSo, 565.48667 + 9.42477796 \u2248574.911447\n\nSo, total 3183\u03c0 \u22489424.77796 + 574.911447 \u22489999.689407\n\nSo, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u22481/9999.689407 \u22480.0001000031\n\nSo, that's approximately 0.0001000031, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 is valid.\n\nSimilarly, for n=319:\n\n319\u03c0 \u2248319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248\n\n300\u03c0\u2248942.477796\n\n19\u03c0\u224859.69026042\n\nTotal \u2248942.477796 + 59.69026042 \u22481002.168056\n\nSo, 1/(319\u03c0)\u22481/1002.168056\u22480.00099784, which is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001000031, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included, so n=3183 is valid. Therefore, the count is 2865.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001, but it's actually just over, so it's included. So, the total number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with an example. Let's take n=318: x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22481/(1000.86)\u22480.00099914, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. But n=318 is less than 318.309, so it's not included, which is correct because n must be greater than 318.309, so n=319 is the first n.\n\nSimilarly, n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001000031, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 -19=2864. Then, 2864 +1=2865.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001, which is the lower bound, but it's actually just over, so it's included. Therefore, the count is 2865.\n\nBut let me think again: the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, for n=3183, x\u22480.0001000031, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included. For n=3184, x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22481/(10003.1)\u22480.000099969, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, n=3183 is the last n that gives x>0.0001.\n\nSimilarly, for n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.00099914, which is less than 0.001, so it's included, but n=318 is less than 318.309, so it's excluded, so n starts at 319.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 +1=2865.\n\nSo, the final answer is 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought about it, I thought that n=3183 would give x\u22480.0001, which is the lower bound, but since it's just over, it's included. So, the count is 2865.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the number of times 1/x crosses an integer multiple of \u03c0 in the interval (1/0.001, 1/0.0001) which is (1000, 10000). So, the number of zeros of sin(1/x) in x \u2208 (0.0001, 0.001) is the same as the number of integers n such that 1/x = n\u03c0, which implies x=1/(n\u03c0), and x must be in (0.0001, 0.001), so 1/(n\u03c0) must be in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Computing 1000/\u03c0 \u2248318.3098862, and 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.098862. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1=2865.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 1/(n\u03c0) must be in that interval. Solving for n, we find n ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) Let's compute that: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.14159265 \u2248 318.3098862. So, n > approximately 318.3098862. Since n must be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to count how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, applying that here: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 = 2864; 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in that interval. Wait, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 1/(0.0001\u03c0) is indeed 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098862, so n can be up to 3183. Then, 1/(0.001\u03c0) is 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098862, so n must be at least 319. Then, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then adding 1 gives 2865. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Solving for x, we get x = 1/(n\u03c0). To find x in (0.0001, 0.001), we determine n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. This gives n between approximately 318.31 and 3183.09, leading to 2865 integer values of n. Thus, there are 2865 x-intercepts.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

Since n must be an integer, the maximum possible n here is 3183. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) Let me compute that: 1/0.001 is 1000, so 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184. Since n is an integer, the smallest possible n here is 319. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are between 319 and 3183, inclusive. To find the number of integers from a to b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the numbers: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 = 2864; 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems too high. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 3183 - 319. 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, but let me think again. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches zero. So, between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a very small interval near zero, the function should have a lot of oscillations. Each oscillation crosses the x-axis twice, except maybe the first one. Wait, no, actually, each full period of sin(1/x) is 2\u03c0/(1/x) = 2\u03c0x, but that's not quite right. Wait, actually, the period of sin(1/x) is a bit tricky because it's not a standard sine function. The function sin(1/x) has its argument 1/x, so as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000. So, the function sin(1/x) goes from sin(10000) to sin(1000). The number of zeros between x = a and x = b, where 0 < a < b, is equal to the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (a, b). So, in this case, a = 0.0001 and b = 0.001. So, we're looking for all integers n where 1/(n\u03c0) is between 0.0001 and 0.001. Which is exactly what I did earlier, leading to n between approximately 318.31 and 3183.09. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, that would suggest there are 2865 x-intercepts in that interval. But wait, that seems a lot. Let me think differently. Alternatively, the number of zeros of sin(1/x) in (a, b) is equal to the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (a, b). So, the number of n is equal to the number of integers between 1/(b\u03c0) and 1/(a\u03c0). So, 1/(b\u03c0) = 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.3099, and 1/(a\u03c0) = 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988. So, the integers n must satisfy 318.3099 < n < 3183.0988. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because each period of sin(1/x) should cross the x-axis twice, right? Once going up and once going down. So, if the number of periods is N, then the number of zeros would be 2N. But in this case, I'm counting each zero once, so maybe I need to adjust. Wait, no, because each zero is a single point where the function crosses the axis. So, each time the function completes a half-period, it crosses zero once. So, the number of zeros is equal to the number of times 1/x passes through an integer multiple of \u03c0, which is exactly what I calculated. So, perhaps 2865 is correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the number of oscillations. The function sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches zero. The number of oscillations between x = a and x = b is approximately (1/(\u03c0a) - 1/(\u03c0b)). So, the number of zeros would be approximately 2*(1/(\u03c0a) - 1/(\u03c0b)). Wait, let me check that. The function sin(\u03b8) has a zero every \u03c0 interval in \u03b8. So, when \u03b8 increases by \u03c0, sin(\u03b8) crosses zero once. So, as x increases from a to b, \u03b8 = 1/x decreases from 1/a to 1/b. So, the change in \u03b8 is (1/a - 1/b). Since \u03b8 is decreasing, the number of zeros would be the number of times \u03b8 crosses an integer multiple of \u03c0, which is approximately (1/a - 1/b)/\u03c0. But since each zero corresponds to a crossing, and sin(\u03b8) crosses zero twice every 2\u03c0 interval, but actually, each \u03c0 interval corresponds to one zero crossing. Wait, no, sin(\u03b8) is zero at \u03b8 = n\u03c0 for integer n, so each zero crossing is at each n\u03c0. So, the number of zeros between \u03b8 = c and \u03b8 = d (where c < d) is floor(d/\u03c0) - ceil(c/\u03c0) + 1. Wait, but in our case, \u03b8 decreases from 1/a to 1/b as x increases from a to b. So, c = 1/a and d = 1/b, with c > d. So, the number of zeros would be floor(d/\u03c0) - ceil(c/\u03c0) + 1. Wait, let's plug in the numbers. c = 1/a = 1/0.0001 = 10000, d = 1/b = 1/0.001 = 1000. So, c = 10000, d = 1000. Now, compute floor(d/\u03c0) = floor(1000/\u03c0) \u2248 floor(318.309886184) = 318. ceil(c/\u03c0) = ceil(10000/\u03c0) \u2248 ceil(3183.09886184) = 3184. So, the number of zeros would be 318 - 3184 + 1 = negative number, which doesn't make sense. Hmm, that can't be right. Maybe I have the formula backwards because c > d. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of it as the number of n where n\u03c0 is between d and c. So, n\u03c0 >= d and n\u03c0 <= c. So, n >= d/\u03c0 and n <= c/\u03c0. So, n ranges from ceil(d/\u03c0) to floor(c/\u03c0). So, in this case, ceil(1000/\u03c0) = 319, and floor(10000/\u03c0) = 3183. So, the number of integers n is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the number of zeros is 2865. Therefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). I think that's the correct answer. I considered the function's behavior, calculated the range of n, and checked using two different approaches, both leading to the same result. So, I'm confident that the number is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

Let me compute these values numerically to find the range of n. First, compute 1/(0.001\u03c0): 0.001 is 10^-3, so 1/(10^-3 * \u03c0) = 10^3 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184. Since n must be an integer, n \u2265 319. Now, compute 1/(0.0001\u03c0): 0.0001 is 10^-4, so 1/(10^-4 * \u03c0) = 10^4 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.09886184.

Each n gives a distinct x-intercept, so the total number is 2865. I think that makes sense. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly as x approaches zero, so in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is very close to zero, it should have a lot of oscillations, hence a large number of x-intercepts. 2865 seems plausible.\n</think>\n\nThe function \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) has x-intercepts where \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\).

Hmm, but wait, I should confirm whether 3183 is indeed included. Since n must be less than approximately 3183.098, the maximum integer n is 3183 because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 3.1416*3183 \u2248 10000. So, 1/x = 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000, so x \u2248 1/10000 = 0.0001. But our interval starts at x > 0.0001, so x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly larger than 0.0001. Let me check: 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) \u2248 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 is slightly less than 10000, 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly larger than 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is indeed within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, for n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.14) \u2248 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval.

No, because \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute that:\n\n3183 * 3 = 9549\n\n3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.1416 \u2248 let's compute 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, 3183 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0928. Adding those: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.0928 \u2248 450.7128. So total is 9549 + 450.7128 \u2248 9999.7128. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.7128, which is just under 10000.

So, starting from sin(1/x) = 0, which gives 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). Then, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.

Similarly, for the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0). So, combining both inequalities, we have: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) < n < 1 / (0.0001\u03c0). Let me compute these values. First, compute 1 / (0.001\u03c0): 0.001 is 1/1000, so 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0. Similarly, 1/(0.0001\u03c0) is 1/(0.0001 * \u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0. So, n must satisfy: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Now, I can compute 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0 numerically to find the range of integers n. Let me recall that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, the smallest integer greater than 318.309886184 is 319, and the largest integer less than 3183.09886184 is 3183. Now, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, we can compute 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me do that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n in that range, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The key step is finding the range of n. So, 1/(0.001\u03c0) is indeed 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so n must be greater than this, so starting at 319. Similarly, 1/(0.0001\u03c0) is 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so n must be less than this, so the largest integer n is 3183. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1, so 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct.

So, n < 3183.098. Since n has to be an integer, n \u2264 3183. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) Let me compute that. 0.001 is 1e-3, so 1e-3 * \u03c0 is approximately 0.00314159. Then 1 divided by that is approximately 318.3098... So, n > 318.3098. Since n must be an integer, n \u2265 319. So, putting it together, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's verify the computation for n in the inequalities. First, 0.0001 = 1e-4, so 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n must be less than that, so n \u2264 3183. Then, 0.001 = 1e-3, so 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098, so n must be greater than that, so n \u2265 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more is 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So that's correct. Wait, but is there a possibility that when n is 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) is less than 0.001? Let me check. 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.17) \u2248 0.000996, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Similarly, for n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0003) \u2248 0.0001, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. So, yes, all integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive are valid.

Let me compute these values numerically to find the range of n. First, compute 1 / (0.0001\u03c0): 0.0001 is 10^-4, so 1 / (10^-4 * \u03c0) = 10^4 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1416 \u2248 3183.0988618 So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618.

First, 1/(0.0001\u03c0): 0.0001 is 1e-4, so 1/(1e-4 * \u03c0) = 1e4 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618, correct. Then, 1/(0.001\u03c0): 0.001 is 1e-3, so 1/(1e-3 * \u03c0) = 1e3 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, correct. So, n must be greater than 318.309, so n starts at 319, and less than 3183.098, so n goes up to 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 is 2865. Hmm, seems correct. So, I think my answer is 2865. But just to be thorough, let me think about the function sin(1/x) near x = 0.0001 and x = 0.001. As x approaches 0 from the positive side, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. Between any two points near zero, there are infinitely many oscillations, but in this case, we're looking at a specific interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, each time 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0, we get an x-intercept. So, for each n, x = 1/(n\u03c0) is an intercept. So, the number of intercepts is the number of integers n such that x is in (0.0001, 0.001). So, as we found, n ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 intercepts. Yeah, I think that's solid.

The initial substitution: x = 1/(n\u03c0) must lie between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0). Which is 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.

So, between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a very small interval near zero, the function oscillates rapidly. So, the number of zeros should be very large. But 2865 seems plausible? Let me check the math again. 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, so n starts at 319. Similarly, 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098.

Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883; 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, 2864 +1 = 2865. So, yes, 2865 x-intercepts. But wait, let me think about whether all these x values lie strictly between 0.0001 and 0.001.

Each oscillation corresponds to a zero crossing, and the number of crossings depends on how many periods fit into that interval. Since the period of sin(1/x) decreases as x approaches zero, the number of zeros increases, but in this case, we're just counting them within the given bounds.

But since x = 1/(n\u03c0), we need to ensure that 1/(n\u03c0) is strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. So, n must be such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, n must be less than 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988618, so n = 3183 is allowed because 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010001, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included.

Let me compute that: 319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 1002.000000. So, x \u2248 1/1002 \u2248 0.000998, which is approximately 0.001, which is within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, for n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/10000 \u2248 0.0001, which is just above 0.0001. So, both endpoints are included in the interval, so n=319 gives x \u2248 0.000998, which is less than 0.001, and n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001, which is greater than 0.0001. So, all n from 319 to 3183 are valid, and the count is 2865.\n\nI think that's correct.

So, n must be less than approximately 3183.098. Since n is an integer, the maximum possible n is 3183. Now, let's take the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) Let me compute that: 1/(0.001\u03c0) is the same as 1000/\u03c0.

The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a = 319 and b = 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but I should double-check if both endpoints are included or excluded. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. So, I need to check if n = 319 and n = 3183 give x values within the open interval.

So, n = 3183 gives x = 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. Let me recalculate the number of integers. Now, a = 319 and b = 3182. So, number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 + 1 = 2864. Wait, that's different from before. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by including n = 3183, which gives x = 0.0001, which is not included in the open interval. Therefore, the correct number of integers is 2864. Let me confirm this. Compute 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865, but since n = 3183 is excluded, it's 2864. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive. The formula is (last - first) + 1. So, 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. Yes, that seems right. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. But wait, let me check another way. The number of zeros of sin(1/x) in (a, b) is equal to the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (a, b). So, solving for n, we have 1/(b\u03c0) < n < 1/(a\u03c0). Since a = 0.0001 and b = 0.001, then 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.30988618 < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183, but since 3183 gives x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded, n goes up to 3182. Therefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.

Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.309. So, n > approximately 318.309. Since n is an integer, n \u2265 319. So, putting it all together, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to count how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a = 319 and b = 3183. So, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. First, 1/(0.0001\u03c0) is indeed 10000/\u03c0, which is about 3183.098. So, n must be less than that, so n \u2264 3183. Then, 1/(0.001\u03c0) is 1000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.309, so n must be greater than that, so n \u2265 319. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but I should check if 3183 is included. Since n must be less than approximately 3183.098, n can be 3183 because 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 1/(3183*3.1416) \u2248 1/10000.0008, which is just slightly less than 0.0001, but wait, no: 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0008) \u2248 0.000099999992, which is less than 0.0001, so actually, 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so x = 1/(3183\u03c0) would be less than 0.0001, which is outside our interval. So, actually, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but we have to check if 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0008) \u2248 0.000099999992, which is less than 0.0001, so x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, which is outside our interval. Therefore, the maximum n for which x is greater than 0.0001 is n = 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000 - \u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.0008 \u2248 0.00010003999, which is greater than 0.0001. So, n can be up to 3182. Similarly, let's check the lower bound. For n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.13) \u2248 0.0009969, which is less than 0.001, so that's within the interval. Wait, but 0.0009969 is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3182. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 + 1 = 2864. Wait, so earlier I thought n went up to 3183, but actually, n should go up to 3182 because 3183 gives x less than 0.0001. So, the correct number is 2864. Let me confirm: n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. The number of terms is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that between 1/(0.001\u03c0) and 1/(0.0001\u03c0), which is between approximately 318.309 and 3183.098, the number of integers is floor(3183.098) - ceil(318.309) + 1. So, floor(3183.098) is 3183, ceil(318.309) is 319, so 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. But wait, earlier I saw that n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) < 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. So, actually, n should only go up to 3182, making it 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. So, which is correct? Let me think again. The interval for x is (0.0001, 0.001). So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 1/x must be between 1000 and 10000. Because if x is 0.001, 1/x is 1000, and if x is 0.0001, 1/x is 10000. So, 1/x is in (1000, 10000). Therefore, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing by \u03c0, we get 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating these: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be integers greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. But wait, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.0008, which is just over 10000, so 1/x = 3183\u03c0 would make x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099999992, which is less than 0.0001, so x would be outside the interval. Therefore, n must be less than or equal to 3182, because 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9999.996, which is just under 10000, so x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010003999, which is greater than 0.0001, so within the interval. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought that 3183\u03c0 is just over 10000, so n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) < 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, n=3183 is excluded, so n goes up to 3182. So, the total number is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. So, the answer is 2864. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, but n=3183 is excluded because x would be less than 0.0001. So, n=3182 is the last n that gives x > 0.0001. Therefore, the number of terms is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. So, I think that's the correct answer. To recap, the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n, and we need x in (0.0001, 0.001), which translates to n between 319 and 3182 inclusive. The number of integers in that range is 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) has x-intercepts where \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\), which occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for integer \\( n \\).

Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Similarly, multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) Calculating 1 / (0.001\u03c0). 0.001 is 10^(-3), so 1 / (10^(-3)\u03c0) = 10^3 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.309.

Since n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319 first. 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct.

Let me compute these values numerically to find the range of n. First, calculate 1/(0.001\u03c0): 1/(0.001) is 1000, so 1000/\u03c0. Let me approximate \u03c0 as 3.1416. So, 1000/3.1416 \u2248 318.3098861. Similarly, 1/(0.0001\u03c0) is 1/0.0001 which is 10000, so 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098861. Therefore, n must be greater than approximately 318.3098861 and less than approximately 3183.098861. But n has to be an integer because it's the multiple in sin(n\u03c0). So, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183. Wait, let me check: n must be greater than 318.3098861, so the smallest integer n is 319. Similarly, n must be less than 3183.098861, so the largest integer n is 3183. Now, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, actually, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 is 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Each such n corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when dealing with inequalities, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me verify the bounds again. The x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, for x to be greater than 0.0001, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098861, so n must be less than that. Similarly, for x to be less than 0.001, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which implies n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.3098861. So, n must be greater than 318.3098861 and less than 3183.098861. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. Now, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that step by step: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of it as starting from n=1 up to n=3183, which would be 3183 numbers, and then subtract the numbers from n=1 to n=318, which is 318 numbers. So, 3183 - 318 = 2865. That confirms it. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, let me check with an example. Let's take n=319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.18) \u2248 0.0009968, which is approximately 0.001, but slightly less, so it's within (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, but slightly more, so it's just above 0.0001, which is also within the interval. So, both endpoints are included, which is why we included 319 and 3183. Therefore, I'm confident that the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n.

Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, let me check: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then adding 1 gives 2865. But wait, that seems a bit high. Let me verify my steps. Alternatively, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the initial substitution again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The x-intercepts are at x = 1/(n\u03c0). We have 0.0001 < x < 0.001. So, substituting x, we get 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and remembering to reverse the inequalities when taking reciprocals because all terms are positive), we get 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which simplifies to 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Then, dividing by \u03c0, we get 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating those: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098. Since n is an integer, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then +1 is 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n, which correspond to 2865 x-intercepts in the given interval. Wait, but let me think again. Is there any chance that when x approaches 0.0001 or 0.001, the function might have more intercepts? Or perhaps I missed something in the interval. Let me double-check the calculations. For x = 0.0001, 1/x = 10000, and for x = 0.001, 1/x = 1000. So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. Since sin(\u03b8) has zeros at \u03b8 = n\u03c0, the number of zeros between \u03b8 = 1000 and \u03b8 = 10000 is the number of integers n where 1000 \u2264 n\u03c0 \u2264 10000. Wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, \u03b8 = 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000 as x goes from 0.001 to 0.0001. So, the zeros occur at \u03b8 = n\u03c0 where n is an integer, and \u03b8 is between 1000 and 10000. So, n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000. Therefore, n must satisfy 1000 \u2264 n\u03c0 \u2264 10000. So, n \u2265 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and n \u2264 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that seems correct.

First, 1/(0.001\u03c0): 0.001 is 10^-3, so 1/0.001 is 1000. So, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 1/(0.0001\u03c0): 0.0001 is 10^-4, so 1/0.0001 is 10000.

So, the integers n start at 319 and go up to 3183. Now, to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then adjust.

Alternatively, I can think of it as starting from n=1 up to n=3183, which is 3183 numbers, then subtract the numbers from n=1 to n=318, which is 318 numbers. So, 3183 - 318 = 2865. Yep, that checks out. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's the answer. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in setting up the inequalities. So, starting with 0.0001 < x < 0.001, and x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, substituting, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Then, flipping the inequalities when taking reciprocals (since n is positive), 1/0.001 > n\u03c0 > 1/0.0001. So, 1000 > n\u03c0 > 10000. Then, dividing by \u03c0, 1000/\u03c0 > n > 10000/\u03c0. Wait, that seems conflicting with my earlier step. Wait, no, because when I take reciprocals, the inequalities reverse. Let me check that again. If 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, then taking reciprocals (and remembering that inequalities reverse when taking reciprocals because all terms are positive), we get 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Then, dividing by \u03c0, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Which is approximately 318.3099 < n < 3183.0988. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, which gives 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that's correct. I think I was just confused for a second there, but now it makes sense.

So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001  \n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000  \n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.10\n\nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"
