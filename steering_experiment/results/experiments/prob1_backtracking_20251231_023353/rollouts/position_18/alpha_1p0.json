    "text": " Let's see, 0.0001 is 1e-4, so 1e-4 * n\u03c0 < 1 => n\u03c0 < 1e4. So, n < 1e4 / \u03c0. Let me compute that: 1e4 is 10,000, and \u03c0 is approximately 3.1416. So, 10,000 / 3.1416 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.098. Since n is an integer, n \u2264 3183.\n\nNow, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Similarly, multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 => n\u03c0 > 1 / 0.001 = 1000. So, n > 1000 / \u03c0. Let me compute that: 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.309. Since n must be an integer, n \u2265 319.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check that calculation. 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 318.309, so the smallest integer n that satisfies n > 318.309 is n = 319. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think: the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, in this case, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there should be 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in setting up the inequalities. So, x has to be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), substituting gives 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me solve each inequality again to confirm.\n\nStarting with the left inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Taking reciprocals on both sides (and remembering that reversing the inequality when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive), we get 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0, which is 10,000 > n\u03c0, so n < 10,000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n \u2264 3183.\n\nNow the right inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals again: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001 = 1000, so n > 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n \u2265 319.\n\nSo, n runs from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, let me check with specific values.\n\nFor example, when n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(319 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(1002.3) \u2248 0.0009977, which is approximately 0.0009977, which is less than 0.001 and greater than 0.0001, so that's within the interval.\n\nSimilarly, when n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, but wait, 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but since n must be less than 3183.098, n = 3183 is allowed because 3183 < 3183.098, so x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since our interval is open at 0.0001, x must be greater than 0.0001. Wait, does x = 1/(3183\u03c0) equal exactly 0.0001? Let me check: 3183\u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute that:\n\n3183 * 3 = 9549\n3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.1416 \u2248 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, 3183 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0928. Adding those together: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.0928 \u2248 450.7128. So total is 9549 + 450.7128 \u2248 9999.7128. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.7128, which is just under 10,000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.7128 \u2248 0.0001000028, which is just over 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000028, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n=3183 is valid.\n\nSimilarly, when n=319, x\u22480.0009977, which is less than 0.001, so it's also within the interval.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of terms. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, from 319 to 3183, that's 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 gives 2865. That seems correct.\n\nJust to check with a smaller example: suppose a=2 and b=5, the numbers are 2,3,4,5, which is 4 numbers. Using the formula: 5 - 2 + 1 = 4. Correct. So, yes, the formula works.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 2865 x-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). For x in (0.0001, 0.001), we find n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, leading to n between 319 and 3183. The number of integers in this range is 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

    "text": " Maybe it's better to take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that taking reciprocals reverses the inequality. So, if 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0), then 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Calculating 1/0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Similarly, for the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Taking reciprocals again: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, putting it together: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values numerically. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n must be an integer strictly greater than 318.309886184 and strictly less than 3183.09886184. So, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183. Now, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then subtract 1 if necessary, but wait, let me think. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me calculate that: 3183 - 319 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n such that 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in that interval. Wait a second, let me double-check that. Is 1/(319\u03c0) greater than 0.0001? Let me compute 1/(319 * 3.1415926535). 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 319 * 3 = 957, 319 * 0.1416 \u2248 319 * 0.1 = 31.9, 319 * 0.0416 \u2248 13.2544. So, total \u2248 957 + 31.9 + 13.2544 \u2248 957 + 45.1544 \u2248 1002.1544. So, 1/1002.1544 \u2248 0.0009978, which is approximately 0.0009978, which is less than 0.001. Wait, but 0.0009978 is less than 0.001, so 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009978, which is within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, for n = 3183: 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1415926535). Let me compute 3183 * 3.1415926535. 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 let's approximate: 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.0415926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, and 3183 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 5.08. So, adding up: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.08 \u2248 450.7. So, total \u2248 9549 + 450.7 \u2248 10,000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10,000 = 0.0001. Wait, but our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.0001, so 0.0001 is excluded. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since the interval is open at 0.0001, we need to exclude this point. So, perhaps n should be less than 3183.09886184, so n can be up to 3183, but since 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded, so the largest n such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n = 3183 - 1 = 3182? Wait, no, because 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, so to have x > 0.0001, we need 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which implies n < 1/(0.0001 * \u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but since 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded, so the maximum n is 3182. Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier calculation. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at both ends. So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, for x = 1/(n\u03c0) to be in (0.0001, 0.001), we need 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, taking reciprocals, since all terms are positive, we reverse the inequalities: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001 = 1000, and n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001 = 10000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 and n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, n can be from 319 up to 3183, because 3183 is less than 3183.09886184, so 3183 is included. Wait, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is not included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, does n go up to 3183 or 3182? Let me check: If n = 3183, then x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded. So, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n such that x > 0.0001 is n = 3183 - 1 = 3182? Wait, no, because n must satisfy n < 3183.09886184, so n can be 3183, but x would be exactly 0.0001, which is excluded. So, n must be less than or equal to 3183, but x must be greater than 0.0001, so n must be less than 3183.09886184, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but since x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is not included, so n must be less than 3183.09886184, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but x would be 0.0001, which is excluded, so the maximum n is 3182. Wait, no, because 3183 is less than 3183.09886184, so 3183 is allowed, but x would be 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but since x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is 0.0001, which is excluded, so n must be up to 3182. Therefore, the number of n's is from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 3182 - 319 = 2863 +1 = 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. Hmm, I'm getting conflicting results. Let me clarify.\n\nLet me approach it differently. The number of integers between a and b inclusive is floor(b) - ceil(a) + 1. So, a = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so ceil(a) = 319. b = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so floor(b) = 3183. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. However, since x must be greater than 0.0001, and x = 1/(3183\u03c0) = 0.0001, which is excluded, so we need to exclude n = 3183. Therefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. Wait, but that would mean n goes from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864. But earlier, using floor(b) - ceil(a) +1, we get 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865, but since n=3183 gives x=0.0001 which is excluded, we have to subtract 1, making it 2864. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, but x must be > 0.0001 and < 0.001, so n must satisfy n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 and n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n can be 319, 320, ..., 3183. But n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so n goes up to 3182. Therefore, the number of n's is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but let me confirm with specific values.\n\nLet me test n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009978, which is less than 0.001 and greater than 0.0001, so included.\n\nn=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001, which is excluded.\n\nn=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22481/(3182*3.1415926535)=1/(approx 10000 - 3.1415926535)=approx 0.0001 + a tiny bit, so x\u22480.0001000... something, which is greater than 0.0001, so included.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let's compute 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 gives 2865. But since n=3183 is excluded, it's 2864.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute the number of integers between 319 and 3182 inclusive. The formula is (last - first) +1. So, 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 gives 2864.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the correct number is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with a small example. Suppose I have numbers from 3 to 5 inclusive. That's 3,4,5: 3 numbers. Using the formula: 5 -3 +1=3. Correct.\n\nIf I have from 3 to 4 inclusive: 2 numbers. 4-3+1=2.\n\nIf I have from 3 to 3 inclusive: 1 number. 3-3+1=1.\n\nSo, applying that, from 319 to 3182 inclusive: 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 2865, but now it's 2864. So, I must have made a mistake earlier when I included n=3183, which gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. So, the correct count is 2864.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the number of zeros between 0.0001 and 0.001. The function y=sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. Each oscillation corresponds to a period of 2\u03c0 in \u03b8, where \u03b8=1/x. So, as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001, \u03b8 increases from 1000 to 10000. So, the number of oscillations is the number of times \u03b8 goes through 2\u03c0, which is (10000 - 1000)/(2\u03c0) \u2248 (9000)/(6.283185307) \u2248 1432.39. But wait, that's the number of periods, but each period has two zeros (one at the start and one at the end), but actually, each period has two zeros, so the number of zeros would be roughly twice that, but actually, between \u03b8=1000 and \u03b8=10000, the number of zeros is the number of times \u03b8 crosses a multiple of \u03c0. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which is the same as n between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which is what I did earlier. So, the number of zeros is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0) +1. Wait, but since the interval is open, we need to exclude the endpoints, so perhaps it's floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0). Let me compute that.\n\nceil(1000/\u03c0) = 319\n\nfloor(10000/\u03c0) = 3183\n\nSo, 3183 - 319 = 2864\n\nBut wait, that's the same as before.\n\nWait, but if I use the formula for the number of integers between a and b exclusive, it's floor(b) - ceil(a). So, in this case, since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which corresponds to n between 319 and 3183, but n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so the number of n's is 3183 - 319 = 2864.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought of it as 2865, but that was including n=3183, which gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. So, the correct answer is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when \u03b8 goes from 1000 to 10000, how many times does sin\u03b8 cross zero? Each time \u03b8 crosses a multiple of \u03c0, which is every \u03c0 units. So, the number of zeros is the number of multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. So, the first multiple after 1000 is ceil(1000/\u03c0)*\u03c0, and the last multiple before 10000 is floor(10000/\u03c0)*\u03c0.\n\nSo, the number of zeros is (floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0)) +1.\n\nWait, but if the interval is open, we don't include the endpoints. So, if 1000 is not a multiple of \u03c0, then the first multiple after 1000 is ceil(1000/\u03c0)*\u03c0, and the last multiple before 10000 is floor(10000/\u03c0)*\u03c0.\n\nSo, the number of zeros is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0) +1.\n\nBut in our case, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248318.309886184, so ceil(1000/\u03c0)=319.\n\n10000/\u03c0\u22483183.09886184, so floor(10000/\u03c0)=3183.\n\nTherefore, number of zeros is 3183 - 319 +1=2865.\n\nBut wait, in the x interval (0.0001,0.001), x=1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, n must satisfy 1000 <n\u03c0<10000, which is n between 319 and 3183 inclusive.\n\nBut x=1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001, which is excluded, so n must be less than 3183.09886184, so n=3183 is excluded. Therefore, the number of n's is 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nWait, but using the formula floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0) +1=3183 -319 +1=2865, but since n=3183 is excluded, it's 2864.\n\nI think the confusion arises because when we count the number of integers between a and b inclusive, it's floor(b) - ceil(a) +1. But if the interval is open, we have to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to note that the number of zeros is equal to the number of integers n such that 1000 <n\u03c0<10000, which is equivalent to 1000/\u03c0 <n<10000/\u03c0.\n\nSince n must be an integer, the number of such n is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0).\n\nSo, floor(10000/\u03c0)=3183, ceil(1000/\u03c0)=319, so 3183 -319=2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of zeros is 2864.\n\nYes, that makes sense because n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so we don't include it.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n gives 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, or 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. The integers n range from 319 to 3182 inclusive, yielding 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864 intercepts.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\n$\\boxed{2864}$"

So, n must be greater than approximately 3183.098. Since n is an integer, n \u2265 3184. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309, meaning n \u2265 319. Wait, that doesn't make sense because from the first inequality, n has to be greater than 3183, which is much larger than 319. So, perhaps I made a mistake in handling the inequalities. Let me double-check. Starting again, 0.0001 < x < 0.001, and x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, substituting, we have 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let's invert all parts, remembering that inverting inequalities reverses them. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those, 1/0.001 = 1000 and 1/0.0001 = 10,000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10,000. Dividing all parts by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10,000/\u03c0. Calculating those, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 10,000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n must satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 is 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n where x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. Let me test with n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.58) \u2248 0.000996, which is less than 0.001 and greater than 0.0001, so it's valid. For n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10,000.0) = 0.0001, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so x = 0.0001 is excluded. So, n can go up to 3182. Let me check n=3182: x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10,000 - \u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000 something, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. Wait, but earlier I thought n goes up to 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded. So, n must be less than 3183, so n \u2264 3182. Let me recalculate the number of integers: from n=319 to n=3182 inclusive. So, the count is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 3182 - 319 = 2863, +1 is 2864. Hmm, so earlier I had 2865, but now I think it's 2864. Let me double-check. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3182 - 319 + 1 = 3182 - 319 = 2863, +1 = 2864. So, the correct number is 2864.

So, 10,000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n is an integer, the maximum integer n can be is 3183. Now, looking at the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Similarly, multiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0. Then, divide both sides by 0.001\u03c0: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) < n. 0.001 is 1e-3, so 1 / (1e-3\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618.

The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 = 2865. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. Wait, 3183 - 319 is 2864, yes, then +1 is 2865. But let me double-check the values of n. So, n starts at 319 because 1/(319\u03c0) is less than 0.001. Let me compute 1/(319\u03c0): 1/(319 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(1003.1015) \u2248 0.0009969, which is just under 0.001, so that's correct. For n=318, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.07) \u2248 0.0009999, which is just over 0.001, so n=318 is excluded, so n starts at 319. Similarly, n=3183: 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.000...) which is exactly 0.0001, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010000..., which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. Wait, but wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but 0.0001 is 1e-4, and 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly more than 1e-4, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 x-intercepts in that interval. But wait, let me check if I did the subtraction correctly. 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Yes, that's correct. So, 2864 +1 = 2865. So, the answer should be 2865. But wait, let me think again. Is there a possibility that I missed any intercepts or counted any extra? Let me take a step back. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is from 1e-4 to 1e-3, the function sin(1/x) will have a very high frequency. Each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, we get another zero crossing. So, the number of zeros is essentially the number of times 1/x passes through multiples of \u03c0 as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001. So, for each n, x = 1/(n\u03c0) must lie in (0.0001, 0.001). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. As I did before, solving for n: 1/(0.001) > n\u03c0 > 1/(0.0001). So, 1000 > n\u03c0 > 10000. Thus, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Which gives n > ~318.309 and n < ~3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183. So, number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. That seems correct. Alternatively, to compute it as floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0) +1. Let me compute 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so floor is 3183. 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so ceil is 319. So, 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, yes, that's correct.

Since n is an integer, the smallest n here is 319.\n\nSo, n must be an integer such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Now, to find how many integers are in this range, we can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add one (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Wait, that seems like a lot, but let me check if I did the arithmetic correctly. 3183 minus 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more, which is 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, so 2865 intercepts. But let me think again: when x is in (0.0001, 0.001), then 1/x is in (1000, 10000). Because 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. Therefore, sin(1/x) will oscillate between -1 and 1 as 1/x increases from 1000 to 10000. Each time 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0, the function crosses zero. So, the number of zeros is the number of multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. Let me compute how many multiples of \u03c0 are in that interval. The smallest multiple of \u03c0 greater than or equal to 1000 is the ceiling of 1000/\u03c0. Similarly, the largest multiple of \u03c0 less than or equal to 10000 is the floor of 10000/\u03c0.\n\nWait, let me compute 1000/\u03c0: \u03c0 is approximately 3.14159265, so 1000 / 3.14159265 \u2248 318.30988618. So, the ceiling of that is 319. Similarly, 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. The floor of that is 3183. So, the number of multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000 is from n=319 to n=3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865, as I had before. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me think again: each time 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0, there's a zero. So, the number of zeros is equal to the number of times 1/x passes through n\u03c0, which is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which gives n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098 and n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886. So, n can be from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of n's is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that's the number of zeros.

So, first, for the lower bound: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Taking reciprocals, as I did, gives n\u03c0 > 10000, so n > 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098.

Taking reciprocals, n\u03c0 > 1000, so n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, the smallest integer n is 319. That seems correct too.\n\nNow, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Let me compute 3183 - 319 = 2864, then add 1 to include both endpoints, so 2865. Hmm, that seems right.\n\nWait, but let me think about whether all these x-values 1/(n\u03c0) actually lie within (0.0001, 0.001).

So, that's within the interval.\n\nSimilarly, for n=3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.000...) which is approximately 0.0001, but since n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10000.000, which is 0.0001, but our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.0001. So, does x=0.0001 count? Wait, the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at both ends, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, for n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since it's exactly 0.0001, it's not included. So, actually, n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is not in the interval.

So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.2 \u2248 0.000100038, which is just a bit over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Whereas n=3183 gives 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10000.000 \u2248 0.0001, which is exactly the lower bound, but since the interval is open, it's not included. So, the maximum n is 3182, not 3183.\n\nWait, so that changes things. So, n must be less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. So, n must be less than or equal to 3182.\n\nSimilarly, let's check n=319: 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nWait, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recast the inequalities.\n\nWe have 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nSo, taking reciprocals:\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nSo, dividing by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nWhich is approximately 318.309 < n < 3183.098\n\nSince n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183, but we have to check if n=3183 is included.\n\nWait, 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 1/(3183 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000.000000) \u2248 0.0001, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), x must be greater than 0.0001, so x=0.0001 is not included. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) is just over 0.0001, which is included.\n\nWait, but let me compute 1/(3182\u03c0):\n\n3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.14159265 \u2248 3182 * 3 = 9546, 3182 * 0.14159265 \u2248 3182 * 0.1 = 318.2, 3182 * 0.04159265 \u2248 let's compute 3182 * 0.04 = 127.28, and 3182 * 0.00159265 \u2248 5.06. So total \u2248 318.2 + 127.28 + 5.06 \u2248 450.54. So, total \u03c0 \u2248 9546 + 450.54 \u2248 9996.54. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.54 \u2248 0.000100035, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval.\n\nSimilarly, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.14159265) \u2248 1/(10000.000) \u2248 0.0001, which is exactly the lower bound, so it's excluded.\n\nTherefore, n can be from 319 up to 3182 inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 2865, but now I think it's 2864 because n goes up to 3182, not 3183.\n\nLet me confirm: n starts at 319 and ends at 3182. The number of terms is 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\nCompute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then -19 more is 2863. Then +1 is 2864.\n\nSo, the correct number is 2864 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial calculation. So, the initial approach was to find n where 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, leading to 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.309 < n < 3183.098. So, n can be 319, 320, ..., 3183. But as we saw, n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so n only goes up to 3182.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers is from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with specific examples. Let's say n=319: x\u22480.0009968, which is less than 0.001, so included. n=3182: x\u22480.000100035, which is just over 0.0001, so included. n=3183: x=0.0001, excluded. So, yes, n=319 to 3182.\n\nSo, the count is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but now it's 2864. So, which is correct?\n\nLet me compute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 -19=2863. Then add 1: 2864.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as the number of integers between a and b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3182 - 319 +1=2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to make sure. Suppose I have numbers from 5 to 7 inclusive. 5,6,7: that's 3 numbers. 7-5+1=3, correct.\n\nSimilarly, from 10 to 12 inclusive: 10,11,12: 3 numbers. 12-10+1=3.\n\nSo, applying that, 3182 - 319 +1=2864.\n\nTherefore, the correct number is 2864.\n\nWait, but I think I might have confused the initial calculation. Let me make sure.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: the function sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. The number of oscillations increases as x approaches 0. The x-intercepts occur at x=1/(n\u03c0), as we established.\n\nSo, in the interval (a, b), where a=0.0001 and b=0.001, the number of x-intercepts is the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (a, b).\n\nSo, 1/(n\u03c0) > a => n < 1/(a\u03c0) = 1/(0.0001 * \u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u22483183.098.\n\nSimilarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < b => n > 1/(b\u03c0) = 1/(0.001 * \u03c0) \u2248318.309.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 318.309 < n < 3183.098.\n\nSince n must be an integer, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so n must be up to 3182.\n\nWait, but let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0):\n\nCompute 3183 * \u03c0 \u22483183 *3.14159265\u22483183*3=9549, 3183*0.14159265\u22483183*0.1=318.3, 3183*0.04159265\u2248approx 3183*0.04=127.32, 3183*0.00159265\u2248approx 5.08. So total\u2248318.3+127.32+5.08\u2248450.7. So total \u03c0\u22489549+450.7\u224810000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0)=1/10000=0.0001, which is exactly the lower bound, so excluded.\n\nTherefore, n can only go up to 3182, as 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.000100035>0.0001, so included.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nNumber of terms: 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 3183 was included, but now I see it's excluded, so the count is 2864.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 2864.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 3182 -319:\n\n3182 -300=2882\n\n2882 -19=2863\n\nThen +1=2864.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). To find x in (0.0001, 0.001), we solve 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, leading to 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3182. The number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\n\\boxed{2864}"

    "text": " Let me compute 0.0001 in terms of fractions to make it easier. 0.0001 is 10^(-4), so 10^(-4) * n\u03c0 < 1 => n < 1 / (10^(-4) * \u03c0) => n < 10^4 / \u03c0. Similarly, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 => 1 < (n\u03c0) * 10^(-3) => n\u03c0 > 10^3 => n > 10^3 / \u03c0. So, n must be greater than 10^3 / \u03c0 and less than 10^4 / \u03c0. Let me compute these values numerically to get a sense of the range of n. First, 10^3 is 1000, and 10^4 is 10,000. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10,000 / \u03c0 \u2248 10,000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, n starts from the next integer after 318.309886184, which is 319, and goes up to the integer before 3183.09886184, which is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Now, I need to count how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is given by b - a + 1. So, substituting a = 319 and b = 3183, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n in this range, each corresponding to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, checking the inequalities: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n, I correctly inverted the inequalities when taking reciprocals, remembering that inverting reverses the inequality direction. Wait, no, actually, when I have 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0), multiplying both sides by n\u03c0 (positive, so inequality remains the same) gives 0.0001 * n\u03c0 < 1, which is correct. Then, solving for n gives n < 10^4 / \u03c0, which is correct. Similarly, for the upper bound: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which leads to n > 10^3 / \u03c0, which is correct. So, n must be greater than ~318.3098 and less than ~3183.0988. Therefore, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest is 3183. Now, the count from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's the answer. Let me just visualize the function to see if this makes sense. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. So, as x gets closer to 0, the function oscillates infinitely many times. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is very close to 0, the function will oscillate very rapidly. Each oscillation corresponds to a period of 2\u03c0 in the argument of the sine function. So, each period corresponds to a change of 2\u03c0 in 1/x, which translates to a change in x of approximately 1/(n\u03c0) - 1/((n+1)\u03c0) \u2248 1/(n^2 \u03c0^2) for large n, but the exact count is given by the number of zeros, which is the number of n's as we found. So, 2865 intercepts seem reasonable in that interval. I think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

So, n < approximately 3183.0988618. Since n is an integer, the maximum possible n is 3183.\n\nNow, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Similarly, multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0. Then, dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n. Calculating that: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.3098862. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.3098862. Since n is an integer, the smallest possible n is 319.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers in this range, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the inequality 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. When I take reciprocals, I need to remember that reversing the inequalities because taking reciprocals of positive numbers reverses the inequality. So, let's redo that step.\n\nStarting with 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities):\n\n1/(0.001) > n\u03c0 > 1/(0.0001)\n\nWhich is 1000 > n\u03c0 > 10000.\n\nThen, dividing each part by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 > n > 10000/\u03c0.\n\nCalculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098862, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 318.3098862 < n < 3183.0988618. Since n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about how the function behaves. As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a small interval near zero, how many oscillations are there?\n\nEach oscillation of sin(1/x) corresponds to a period of 2\u03c0 in \u03b8 = 1/x. So, the number of oscillations between x = a and x = b is (1/a - 1/b)/(2\u03c0). Each oscillation has two x-intercepts (except possibly at the endpoints), so the number of x-intercepts would be approximately 2 times the number of oscillations.\n\nWait, let me see. The number of zeros of sin(\u03b8) between \u03b8 = A and \u03b8 = B is roughly (B - A)/\u03c0, since every \u03c0 interval, there's a zero. But wait, actually, between \u03b8 = A and \u03b8 = B, the number of zeros is floor((B - A)/\u03c0) + 1 or something like that. Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact number of zeros.\n\nBut in this case, since we're dealing with x in (0.0001, 0.001), \u03b8 = 1/x goes from 1000 to 10000. So, \u03b8 ranges from 1000 to 10000. The zeros of sin(\u03b8) occur at \u03b8 = n\u03c0. So, the number of zeros in \u03b8 \u2208 [1000, 10000] is equal to the number of integers n such that 1000 \u2264 n\u03c0 \u2264 10000. Which is the same as n between 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098862 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 zeros. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that each oscillation has two x-intercepts, but in reality, each zero crossing is a single x-intercept, so maybe I was overcomplicating it. So, the number of zeros is indeed 2865, so that's the number of x-intercepts. So, I think my initial calculation is correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\):\n\n1. **Identify where \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\):**\n   - This occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\), where \\( n \\) is an integer.\n   - Thus, \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n\n2. **Determine the range of \\( n \\) such that \\( x \\) is within \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\):**\n   - \\( 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\)\n   - Taking reciprocals and reversing inequalities: \\( 1000 < n\\pi < 10000 \\)\n   - Dividing by \\( \\pi \\): \\( \\frac{1000}{\\pi} < n < \\frac{10000}{\\pi} \\)\n   - Calculating bounds: \\( 318.31 < n < 3183.098 \\)\n   - Thus, \\( n \\) ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of integers in this range:**\n   - Number of integers = \\( 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 \\).\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

Now, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, no, wait. Let me think carefully. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319, and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that. 3183 - 319 = 2864, and then +1 is 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Each of these n corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me check my calculations again because sometimes when dealing with inequalities, especially with reciprocals, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me verify the initial substitution again. We have x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), we have 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and remembering that flipping inequalities when taking reciprocals because reciprocals reverse the order for positive numbers), so 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. That gives 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which is what I had earlier. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. So, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2865. So, 2865 intercepts. Wait, but let me make sure that each n in that range gives a unique x in the interval. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), as n increases, x decreases. So, when n increases by 1, x decreases. So, starting from n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.14) \u2248 0.0009968, which is just above 0.001? Wait, no, 0.0009968 is 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001, but wait, 0.0009968 is approximately 0.0009968, which is 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001. Wait, but 0.0001 is 0.0001, so 0.0009968 is greater than 0.0001, so it's within the interval. Wait, but let me check n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.14) \u2248 0.0009968, which is 0.0009968, which is 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001. Wait, but 0.0009968 is 0.0009968, which is 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the upper bound. Similarly, n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, which is exactly 0.0001, but our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, x=0.0001 is excluded, and x=0.001 is excluded. So, for n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009968, which is just below 0.001, so it's included. For n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000\u03c0) \u2248 0.00003183, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Wait, that's a problem. So, my earlier calculation might be off because when n increases beyond 3183, x becomes less than 0.0001, which is outside our interval. So, actually, the maximum n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is when 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, so n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001 = 10000, so n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, the maximum integer n is 3183, but we have to check if x=1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Let's compute 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183*3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001 exactly. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but our interval is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is not included. Therefore, the maximum n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3183, but since x=1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001 is excluded, we need to check if n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so the maximum n that gives x>0.0001 is n=3182. Let me check: n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182*3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000 - 3.1415926535) \u2248 approximately 1/(9996.8584) \u2248 0.00010003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. So, n can go up to 3182. Similarly, the lower bound: n must be greater than 318.309886184, so the smallest integer n is 319. So, now the range of n is from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 is 2864. So, 2864 integers. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought n went up to 3183, but since n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so we have to stop at n=3182. So, the correct number is 2864. Let me double-check that calculation: 3182 - 319 +1. Let's compute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 -19=2863. Then +1=2864. So, 2864 intercepts. Wait, but let me check with specific examples. Let's take n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009968, which is within (0.0001, 0.001). n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.00010003, which is just above 0.0001, so included. n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001 exactly, which is excluded. So, n goes from 319 to 3182, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 +1=2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. But wait, let me think again. Because when I computed 1000/\u03c0\u2248318.309886184, so n must be greater than that, so the smallest integer n is 319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.09886184, so n must be less than that, so the largest integer n is 3183. But wait, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001, which is excluded, so the largest n is 3182. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182, inclusive. So, number of terms is 3182 -319 +1=2864. So, the answer is 2864. But wait, let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the initial substitution. The function is y=sin(1/x), and we're looking for x-intercepts in (0.0001, 0.001). So, sin(1/x)=0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so x=1/(n\u03c0). So, x must be in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 <1/(n\u03c0) <0.001. So, taking reciprocals and reversing inequalities: 1/0.001 <n\u03c0 <1/0.0001, so 1000 <n\u03c0 <10000. Therefore, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 <n <10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.309886184 <n <3183.09886184. So, n can be integers from 319 to 3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so n goes up to 3182. Therefore, the number of integers is 3182 -319 +1=2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). To find x in (0.0001, 0.001), we solve 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, leading to 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing by \u03c0, we get 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. The integers n range from 319 to 3182, inclusive. The number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\n$\\boxed{2864}$"

    "text": " Let me compute 0.0001 in terms of fractions. 0.0001 is 10^-4, so 0.0001 = 1/10000. So, 1/10000 * n\u03c0 < 1. Multiplying both sides by 10000: n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n < approximately 3183.0988618. Since n has to be an integer, the maximum integer n can be is 3183. Now, let's take the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Similarly, multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0. Then, dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n. 0.001 is 10^-3, so 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n > approximately 318.30988618. Since n must be an integer, the smallest integer n can be is 319. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. Now, I need to count how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, in this case, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 x-intercepts in that interval. Wait a minute, let me double-check that. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct. But let me just verify my initial inequalities again to make sure I didn't flip anything. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, solving for n, we have 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0). Wait, 1/(0.001\u03c0) is 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, and 1/(0.0001\u03c0) is 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be greater than 318.30988618 and less than 3183.0988618. Since n is an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the count is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that seems consistent. Hmm, but wait, let me think about whether both endpoints are included or not. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. So, I need to check if 1/(n\u03c0) equals exactly 0.0001 or 0.001 for any integer n. Let's see: 0.0001 is 1/10000, so if 1/(n\u03c0) = 1/10000, then n = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618, which is not an integer, so the x-intercept at x \u2248 0.000314159... is not exactly at 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) = 0.001 implies n = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, which is also not an integer, so the x-intercept at x \u2248 0.00314159... is not exactly at 0.001, so it's included. Therefore, all x-intercepts in the interval are accounted for by n from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the total number is 2865. Let me just make sure that n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0) which is approximately 1/(319*3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(1002.7000000) \u2248 0.0009973, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Similarly, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183*3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000.0000000) \u2248 0.0001, but since the interval is open, x=0.0001 is excluded, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) is just slightly greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive give x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we determine where \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\).

    "text": " Let's compute 0.0001 as 10^{-4}, so 10^{-4} * n\u03c0 < 1 => n\u03c0 < 10^4 => n < 10^4 / \u03c0. Similarly, for the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 => 1 < n\u03c0 * 0.001 => n\u03c0 > 1000 => n > 1000 / \u03c0. So, putting it together, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10^4 / \u03c0. Let me compute these values numerically to find the range of n. First, compute 1000/\u03c0. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10^4 is 10000, so 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, n ranges from the next integer after 318.309886184, which is 319, up to the integer just below 3183.09886184, which is 3183. So, n can be 319, 320, 321, ..., 3183. Now, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can compute 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me calculate that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n in that range. Each of these n corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2865.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, starting from the inequalities:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nI converted them to:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nWhich is correct because taking reciprocals and flipping the inequalities, but since all terms are positive, that's fine.\n\nCalculating 1000/\u03c0: 1000 divided by approximately 3.14159265 is indeed about 318.309886184.\n\nSimilarly, 10000/\u03c0 is about 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.309..., so the smallest integer n is 319.\n\nn must be less than 3183.098..., so the largest integer n is 3183.\n\nNow, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is calculated by subtracting and adding 1.\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me verify this calculation again because sometimes it's easy to make an off-by-one error.\n\nIf I have numbers from a to b inclusive, the count is b - a + 1.\n\nSo, a = 319, b = 3183.\n\nSo, 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as starting at n=1, the number of terms up to 3183 is 3183, and up to 318 is 318, so the number of terms from 319 to 3183 is 3183 - 318 = 2865. Wait, that might be another way to see it.\n\nYes, because the number of integers from 1 to 3183 is 3183, and from 1 to 318 is 318, so the number from 319 to 3183 is 3183 - 318 = 2865. That's correct.\n\nSo, the total number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again: each n corresponds to exactly one x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, each n in 319 to 3183 gives a unique x-intercept in that interval. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem or if I can check it another way.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the function y = sin(1/x). As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly between -1 and 1. The x-intercepts occur where 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0, as we established.\n\nSo, for x in (0.0001, 0.001), which is a very small interval near zero, the function sin(1/x) oscillates very rapidly. Each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, we get another x-intercept. So, the number of x-intercepts is essentially how many times \u03c0 fits into the interval of 1/x as x goes from 0.0001 to 0.001.\n\nWait, let me think about that. The change in 1/x as x goes from 0.0001 to 0.001 is from 10000 to 10000/1000 = 10000 to 1000. Wait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, 1/(0.0001) is 10000, and 1/(0.001) is 1000. So, as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000. So, the interval for 1/x is from 1000 to 10000, but in reverse, since x is increasing. Wait, but in terms of the function sin(1/x), as x increases, 1/x decreases, so the argument of the sine function decreases from 10000 to 1000. So, the function is moving from a high frequency oscillation towards lower frequency as x increases.\n\nBut in terms of x-intercepts, each time 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0, we get an x-intercept. So, the number of x-intercepts is the number of times 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0 as x goes from 0.0001 to 0.001.\n\nSo, starting at x = 0.0001, 1/x = 10000, and ending at x = 0.001, 1/x = 1000. So, the interval for 1/x is from 1000 to 10000, but in reverse. So, the number of multiples of \u03c0 in (1000, 10000) is the same as the number of integers n where 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which is the same as before. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is the length of the interval for 1/x is 10000 - 1000 = 9000. Each oscillation of sin(\u03b8) crosses zero every \u03c0 interval. So, the number of zeros would be approximately 9000 / \u03c0, which is about 2866. But since we're dealing with exact counts, it's better to compute it as we did before.\n\nWait, but 9000 / \u03c0 is approximately 2866.197, which is close to 2865. That makes sense because we're counting the number of times \u03b8 crosses a multiple of \u03c0 in that interval, which is the floor of (10000/\u03c0) minus the ceiling of (1000/\u03c0) plus 1, which gives exactly 2865.\n\nSo, I think that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

    "text": " Let me compute 0.0001 in terms of fractions. 0.0001 is 10^-4, which is 1/10000. So, 0.0001 = 1/10000. So, substituting that in: (1/10000) * n\u03c0 < 1 \u21d2 n\u03c0 < 10000 \u21d2 n < 10000/\u03c0. Similarly, for the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u21d2 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 \u21d2 n\u03c0 > 1/0.001 \u21d2 n\u03c0 > 1000 \u21d2 n > 1000/\u03c0. So, now I have n > 1000/\u03c0 and n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0 numerically. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, n starts from the next integer after 318.309886184, which is 319, and goes up to the integer just below 3183.09886184, which is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers in this range, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Wait, that seems correct? Let me check again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me think about it: the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, yes, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. But wait, let me double-check the computation: 3183 minus 319. Let's compute 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. So, yes, 2864, then +1 is 2865. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me make sure that all these n values are valid, meaning that x = 1/(n\u03c0) indeed falls within (0.0001, 0.001). Let me take n=319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(319 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(1003.08) \u2248 0.000997, which is approximately 0.000997, which is just under 0.001. So, that's within the interval. Now, for n=3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000.000...) \u2248 0.0001, but since it's 1/(3183\u03c0), it's slightly less than 0.0001 because 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000. Wait, actually, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let me compute 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, and 183\u03c0 \u2248 574.76314, so total is approximately 9424.77796 + 574.76314 \u2248 9999.5411. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.5411, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.5411 \u2248 0.0001000046, which is just over 0.0001, but our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 is excluded. So, x must be greater than 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, n must be less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886. So, n=3183 would give x \u2248 0.0001000046, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. Similarly, n=3184 would give x \u2248 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3184 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10002.929) \u2248 0.00009997, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, n goes up to 3183. Similarly, for the lower end, n=319 gives x \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. If I take n=318, then x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.000...) \u2248 0.001, but let me compute it more accurately: 318\u03c0 \u2248 318 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 1000.000... something? Wait, 318 * 3.1415926535: 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477, 18\u03c0 \u2248 56.548, so total is \u2248 942.477 + 56.548 \u2248 999.025. So, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/999.025 \u2248 0.001001, which is just over 0.001, so it's excluded. Therefore, n must start at 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. Now, let's compute the number of integers in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, there are 2865 integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me think again: for each n from 319 to 3183, we have an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). Each such x is in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, the number of x-intercepts is exactly the number of integers n in that range, which is 2865. So, I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me think about whether I might have missed something. For example, do I need to consider whether 1/(n\u03c0) is unique for each n? Yes, because n is unique, so each n gives a unique x in the interval. Also, since n increases, x decreases, so each x is unique and lies in the interval. Therefore, the total number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check the computation of 3183 - 319 + 1 again. So, 3183 minus 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, 3183 - 319 = 2864, so the number of integers is 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, yes, 2865 is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, a is 319, b is 3183. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

Therefore, (n\u03c0)/10000 < 1 => n\u03c0 < 10000 => n < 10000/\u03c0. Similarly, for the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => 1/(n\u03c0) < 1/1000 (since 0.001 = 10^(-3) = 1/1000). Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < n\u03c0/1000 => 1000 < n\u03c0 => n > 1000/\u03c0. So, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Now, let me compute these values numerically to get an idea of the range of n. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so let's compute 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0. First, 1000 divided by \u03c0: 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n starts at the next integer after 318.309886184, which is 319, and goes up to the integer just below 3183.09886184, which is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Now, I need to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183, inclusive. To find the number of integers from a to b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the numbers: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers in that range. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait a second, let me just double-check that calculation. 3183 minus 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then minus 19 more is 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865. Yeah, that seems right. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Hmm, but let me think again. Is each n from 319 to 3183 inclusive giving a unique x in (0.0001, 0.001)? Let me confirm with specific examples. Let's take n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.14) \u2248 0.0009968, which is approximately 0.0009968, which is between 0.0001 and 0.001. Similarly, n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10000, so x is just over 0.0001, which is within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but since 3183 is the upper limit, x would be just above 0.0001, which is still inside the interval. So, all these n's from 319 to 3183 do indeed correspond to x's in (0.0001, 0.001). So, the count is 2865.

Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, the maximum integer n can be is 3183. Similarly, for the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 => 1 < n\u03c0 * 0.001 => n\u03c0 > 1 / 0.001 => n\u03c0 > 1000.

So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = let's compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then +1 is 2865.

So, that would mean there are 2865 integer values of n. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in that interval. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me double-check the calculations. Starting with the inequalities: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, solving for n:\n\nFor the lower bound: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n\u03c0 < 10000 => n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n \u2264 3183.\n\nFor the upper bound: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n\u03c0 > 1000 => n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n \u2265 319.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Now, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, so adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me consider whether 1/(319\u03c0) is indeed greater than 0.001. Let me compute 1/(319\u03c0). Since \u03c0 \u2248 3.14159265, 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.14159265 \u2248 let's compute 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477, 19\u03c0 \u2248 59.690, so total \u2248 942.477 + 59.690 \u2248 1002.167. So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.167 \u2248 0.0009978, which is approximately 0.0009978, which is less than 0.001. Wait, that's a problem because our upper bound was 0.001, so 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, so n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n must be at least 319. But 1/(319\u03c0) is approximately 0.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so that's within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, for n=3183, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.14159265) \u2248 1/(10000.00000015) \u2248 0.0001, which is just above 0.0001, so that's also within the interval.\n\nWait, but let me check: For n=3183, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10000, which is 0.0001. So, 0.0001 is the lower bound, but the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so it doesn't include 0.0001. So, does x=1/(3183\u03c0) lie inside the interval? Since 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but 0.0001 is excluded, so maybe n should be up to 3182 instead of 3183. Wait, that's a crucial point. Let me think again.\n\nSo, the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which means x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, when x approaches 0.0001 from above, 1/x approaches 10000. So, 1/x = n\u03c0, so n = 1/(x\u03c0). So, when x approaches 0.0001 from above, n approaches 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, the maximum integer n such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3183, because 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, 1/(n\u03c0) must be less than 1/0.0001, which is 10000. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Wait, 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001, so n must be less than 1/(0.0001 * \u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, the maximum integer n is 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, which is excluded. So, does that mean n can be up to 3183? Wait, if x must be greater than 0.0001, then 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001, so n must be less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is not included in the interval. So, the next lower n would be 3182, which gives x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 slightly larger than 0.0001. So, does that mean the maximum n is 3182? Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let's consider that x must satisfy 0.0001 < x < 0.001, so substituting x = 1/(n\u03c0), we get:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing all parts by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nSo, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098.\n\nSo, n must be integers strictly greater than 318.309 and strictly less than 3183.098. Therefore, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest integer n is 3183. But wait, when n=3183, 1/(n\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound of the interval, which is excluded. So, does n go up to 3183 or 3182?\n\nWait, let's compute 1/(3183\u03c0):\n\n3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 Let me compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 183\u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 575.2356, so total \u2248 9424.77796 + 575.2356 \u2248 10,000.01356. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10000.01356 \u2248 0.00009999986, which is just below 0.0001. Wait, that's less than 0.0001, which is the lower bound of the interval. So, x must be greater than 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001. Therefore, n must be less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999986, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. Therefore, the maximum n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182*3.14159265) \u2248 1/(10000 - 10000.01356 + 3182? Wait, no, perhaps better to compute 3182\u03c0:\n\n3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.14159265 \u2248 Let me compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 182\u03c0 \u2248 182 * 3.14159265 \u2248 572.0946, so total \u2248 9424.77796 + 572.0946 \u2248 10,000 - approximately. Wait, 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 10,000 - 3.14159265? Wait, that can't be. Wait, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000.01356, so 3182\u03c0 \u2248 3183\u03c0 - \u03c0 \u2248 10,000.01356 - 3.14159265 \u2248 9996.871967. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.871967 \u2248 0.0001000314, which is just above 0.0001, so x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000314, which is within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n=3182 gives x \u2248 0.0001000314, which is inside the interval. So, the maximum n is 3182, and the minimum n is 319.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n could go up to 3183, but since n=3183 gives x \u2248 0.00009999986, which is less than 0.0001, it's excluded. So, n can be from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 is 2864. So, that would be 2864 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, which is correct? Let me check again.\n\nIf n starts at 319 and ends at 3182, then the count is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, let me test with smaller numbers to see if my formula is correct. For example, how many integers from 5 to 10 inclusive? 10 -5 +1=6, which are 5,6,7,8,9,10. So, that works. So, applying that here, 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nBut earlier, when I considered n up to 3183, I got 2865, but that included n=3183, which gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00009999986, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the correct upper limit is n=3182, giving 2864 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me compute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300=2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 -19=2863. Then, 2863 +1=2864. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the number of integers between 319 and 3182 inclusive is (3182 - 319) +1=2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with n=319: 1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. And n=3182: 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.0001000314, which is greater than 0.0001, so included. So, the count is from 319 to 3182, which is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n could go up to 3183, but that was a mistake because 3183\u03c0\u224810,000.01356, so 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00009999986, which is less than 0.0001, so excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, giving 2864 intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me check again: 1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so included. 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.0001000314, which is greater than 0.0001, so included. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182, inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 +1=2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 3183 was included, but that was wrong because 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001. So, the correct count is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009978, which is within (0.0001, 0.001). When n=3182, x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.0001000314, which is just above 0.0001, so included. So, the number of n's is from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nSo, 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought it was 2865, but now it's 2864. Let me make sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the number of integers between a and b exclusive. Wait, but in this case, the interval is open, so x must be strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. So, x=1/(n\u03c0) must satisfy 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which implies that n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so n must be strictly greater than 1000/\u03c0\u2248318.309 and strictly less than 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.098. Therefore, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Wait, but wait, when n=3183, 1/(n\u03c0)=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00009999986, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, n can only go up to 3182.\n\nWait, this is conflicting. Let me try a different approach. Let me compute 1/(n\u03c0) for n=3183: 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00009999986, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, n can only go up to 3182, which gives 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.0001000314, which is greater than 0.0001, so included.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with n=3183: 1/(3183\u03c0)= approximately 0.00009999986, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nThus, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure. Let me compute the exact values for n=3182 and n=3183.\n\nCompute n=3182:\n\n3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3000\u03c0\u22489424.77796, 182\u03c0\u2248572.0946, so total\u22489424.77796 + 572.0946\u224810,000 - 3.1415926535\u22489996.871967.\n\nSo, 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22481/9996.871967\u22480.0001000314.\n\nWhich is approximately 0.0001000314, which is greater than 0.0001, so included.\n\nn=3183:\n\n3183 * \u03c0\u22483183 * 3.1415926535\u22483182\u03c0 + \u03c0\u22489996.871967 + 3.1415926535\u224810,000.01356.\n\nSo, 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22481/10000.01356\u22480.00009999986, which is less than 0.0001, so excluded.\n\nTherefore, the maximum n is 3182, giving x\u22480.0001000314, which is included.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nNumber of integers: 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but I thought earlier it was 2865. Let me check the calculation again: 3182 -319=2863, then +1=2864.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with n=319:\n\nn=319, x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so included.\n\nn=3182, x\u22480.0001000314, included.\n\nSo, the count is from 319 to 3182, which is 2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me think if I missed anything. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a very small interval near zero, the function oscillates rapidly. Each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the sine function completes a half-period, leading to an intercept. So, the number of intercepts corresponds to the number of times 1/x passes through multiples of \u03c0 in that interval. So, the number of intercepts is the number of integers n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) lies within (0.0001, 0.001). As we've calculated, that's 2864.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial setup. The function y=sin(1/x) has zeros where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x=1/(n\u03c0). So, to find x in (0.0001, 0.001), we need 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n, we get 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so n must be between 1000/\u03c0\u2248318.309 and 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x\u22480.00009999986, which is less than 0.0001, so excluded. Therefore, n goes up to 3182, giving 2864 intercepts.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we start by noting that the sine function is zero when its argument is an integer multiple of \\( \\pi \\). Therefore, \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\) when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for some integer \\( n \\). This implies \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n\nWe need to find all such \\( x \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\). This translates to finding integers \\( n \\) such that:\n\n\\[ 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\]\n\nRewriting these inequalities:\n\n1. \\( 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\) implies \\( n\\pi < 10000 \\) or \\( n < \\frac{10000}{\\pi} \\approx 3183.098 \\).\n2. \\( \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\) implies \\( n\\pi > 1000 \\) or \\( n > \\frac{1000}{\\pi} \\approx 318.309 \\).\n\nThus, \\( n \\) must be an integer such that \\( 319 \\leq n \\leq 3182 \\) because \\( n = 3183 \\) gives \\( x \\approx 0.00009999986 \\), which is less than 0.0001 and excluded.\n\nThe number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is calculated as:\n\n\\[ 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2864}\n\\]"

Similarly, for the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 => 1 < n\u03c0 * 0.001 => n\u03c0 > 1000 => n > 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.3098. So, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.3098 and less than approximately 3183.098. Since n has to be an integer, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers a and b inclusive, it's b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 = 2864; 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, let me check that again. 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, that would mean there are 2865 integers in that range, which would correspond to 2865 x-intercepts. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. Let me verify the bounds again. The lower bound was n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098, so the smallest integer n is 319. The upper bound was n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so the largest integer n is 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864; 2864 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. So, does that mean there are 2865 x-intercepts? Wait, but I should consider whether all these n values actually result in x within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Let me check for n=319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.23) \u2248 0.0009977, which is just below 0.001, so it's within the interval. For n=3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10001.09) \u2248 0.00009999, which is just above 0.0001, so it's also within the interval. So, all these n from 319 to 3183 inclusive give x in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me think again: is it possible that some n's might result in x outside the interval? For example, n=319 gives x\u22480.0009977 which is less than 0.001, so it's okay. n=3183 gives x\u22480.00009999, which is greater than 0.0001, so that's okay too. So, all the n's from 319 to 3183 inclusive will give x within (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is indeed 2865. Wait, but 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. That seems correct. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, leading to x = 1/(n\u03c0).

    "text": " Let's compute 0.0001 in terms of fractions. 0.0001 is 10^(-4), so 10^(-4) * n\u03c0 < 1. So, n\u03c0 < 10^4. Therefore, n < 10^4 / \u03c0. Let me compute that. 10^4 is 10,000. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 10,000 / \u03c0 \u2248 10,000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n < approximately 3183.0988618. Since n is an integer, n \u2264 3183.\n\nNow, let's take the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Similarly, multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0. Then, dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) < n. 0.001 is 10^(-3), so 1 / (10^(-3)\u03c0) = 10^3 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n > approximately 318.30988618. Since n is an integer, n \u2265 319.\n\nSo, n must be an integer such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Each of these n corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).

Let me correct that. If 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0), then 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which implies n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001 = 10000, so n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, which matches my earlier result.\n\nSimilarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n\u03c0 > 1/0.001 = 1000, so n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, which gives n \u2265 319.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 +1 = 2865. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the endpoints.

Hmm, 0.0009979 is less than 0.001, but greater than 0.0001, so it's inside the interval.\n\nFor n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000.0001) \u2248 0.000099999999, which is just below 0.0001. Wait, but 0.000099999999 is less than 0.0001, so it's actually outside the interval. Hmm, so does that mean n = 3183 is excluded?\n\nWait, because 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099999999 is less than 0.0001, so it's not in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n must be less than or equal to 3182? Wait, no, let's check n = 3183: 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099999999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the upper limit for n is 3182.\n\nWait, but earlier I had n \u2264 3183 because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.0001, which is just over 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is just under 0.0001. So, n must be less than or equal to 3182 to have x \u2265 0.0001.\n\nWait, let me compute 1/(3182\u03c0): 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's see, 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 182\u03c0 \u2248 571.897, so total \u2248 9424.77796 + 571.897 \u2248 9996.675. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.675 \u2248 0.0001000333, which is just above 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000333, which is within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n can be 319 up to 3182, inclusive. So, the upper limit is n = 3182.\n\nSimilarly, let's check n = 3183: 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099999999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nSo, now, the range of n is 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3182. Now, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, that would be 2864 integers.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n went up to 3183, but since 3183 gives x just below 0.0001, it's excluded. So, the correct upper limit is n = 3182, giving 2864 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me compute 1/(3182\u03c0) and 1/(3183\u03c0) precisely.\n\nCompute 3182 * \u03c0:\n\n3182 * 3.1415926535:\n\nLet me compute 3000\u03c0 = 9424.77796077\n\n182\u03c0 = 182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 182 * 3 = 546, 182 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 182 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 25.77796077\n\nSo, 546 + 25.77796077 \u2248 571.77796077\n\nSo, total 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796077 + 571.77796077 \u2248 9996.55592154\n\nSo, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.55592154 \u2248 0.0001000333, which is just above 0.0001, so included.\n\nNow, 3183\u03c0 = 3182\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2248 9996.55592154 + 3.1415926535 \u2248 10000.00000000 (approximately). So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10000 = 0.0001 exactly. But since our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.0001, so x must be greater than 0.0001. So, x = 0.0001 is excluded. Therefore, n = 3183 gives x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since it's exactly 0.0001 when n = 3183.0988618, but since n must be integer, n = 3183 gives x \u2248 0.0001, but it's actually slightly less than 0.0001 because 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001. Therefore, n = 3183 gives x \u2248 0.000099999999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded.\n\nTherefore, the maximum n is 3182, which gives x \u2248 0.0001000333, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 +1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but now I'm getting 2864. Which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me check.\n\nCompute 3182 - 319:\n\n3182 - 300 = 2882\n\n2882 - 19 = 2863\n\nSo, 3182 - 319 = 2863\n\nThen, 2863 +1 = 2864.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 2864.\n\nBut earlier, when I took n up to 3183, I got 2865, but since n = 3183 is excluded, it's 2864.\n\nWait, but let me make sure: if I have n starting at 319 and ending at 3182, the count is 3182 - 319 +1.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me take a smaller example to check. Suppose I have n from 3 to 5 inclusive. 3,4,5: that's 3 numbers. 5 -3 +1 = 3, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, from 319 to 3182: 3182 -319 +1 = 2864.\n\nSo, the correct number is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n went up to 3183, but since that's excluded, it's 3182.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with n = 3182: x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000333, which is in (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nn = 319: x \u2248 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009979, which is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nSo, each n from 319 to 3182 gives an x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 2864 intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me check if n=319 is included. 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009979, which is less than 0.001, so yes, it's included.\n\nSimilarly, n=3182: \u22480.0001000333, which is greater than 0.0001, so included.\n\nSo, the count is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 3183 -319 +1=2865, but since n=3183 is excluded, it's 2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more.\n\nCompute 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 is 2864.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 2864 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but let me think again: the function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is close to zero, it oscillates very rapidly. Each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the sine function completes a cycle, crossing zero. So, the number of zeros should correspond to how many times 1/x crosses multiples of \u03c0 in that interval.\n\nSo, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001). Which translates to n in (1000/\u03c0, 10000/\u03c0), which is approximately (318.309, 3183.098). So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, but since n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is excluded, n goes up to 3182.\n\nThus, the number of integers is 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is 2864.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

Similarly, for the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 \u21d2 1 < n\u03c0 * 1e-3 \u21d2 n\u03c0 > 1e3 \u21d2 n > 1e3 / \u03c0. So, n must be greater than 1e3 / \u03c0 and less than 1e4 / \u03c0. Let me compute these values numerically. First, compute 1e3 / \u03c0: 1e3 is 1000, so 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 1e4 / \u03c0 is 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886 and less than approximately 3183.09886. Since n must be an integer, n can take integer values from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the values: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. Wait, 3183 minus 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more to get 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 2865 integer values of n where x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me think again. When n increases, x decreases because x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, as n goes from 319 to 3183, x goes from 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.3) \u2248 0.0009976, which is just below 0.001, down to 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) \u2248 0.0001, which is just above 0.0001. So, each integer n in this range gives a unique x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of zeros is indeed 3183 - 318 = 2865. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, when n starts at 319, the x is just below 0.001, and as n increases, x decreases towards 0.0001. So, each n corresponds to a unique x in the interval. Therefore, the number of n's is the number of x-intercepts. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, the answer should be 2865 x-intercepts. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial setup. The function is sin(1/x). The zeros occur at 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). The interval is (0.0001, 0.001). So, x must satisfy 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n: 1/(0.001) > n\u03c0 > 1/(0.0001). So, 1000 > n\u03c0 > 10000. Therefore, n < 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3099 and n > 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0989. Wait, hold on, that seems contradictory. Wait, let's see: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let's invert the inequalities, remembering that inverting reverses the inequality signs. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. That is, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3099 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0989. So, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that's correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Therefore, the final answer is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Solving for x gives x = 1/(n\u03c0).

So, n must be greater than approximately 3183.098. Since n has to be an integer, n must be at least 3184. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) Computing that: 1/0.001 is 1000, so 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309, which means n starts at 319. Wait, but earlier we had n > 3183.098, so n must satisfy both conditions. So, n has to be greater than 3183.098, which is the higher lower bound. Therefore, n starts at 3184. Now, I need to find the maximum n such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, but I think I should instead find the range of n where 1/(n\u03c0) is between 0.0001 and 0.001. Wait, perhaps it's better to find the range of n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me solve for n in both inequalities. Starting with 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001: n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183. Wait, that contradicts what I had earlier. Let me think again. Wait, no, when I have 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, that implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0). Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n > 1/(0.001\u03c0). So, n must satisfy 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0). Let me compute both ends. 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309, and 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be an integer between 319 and 3183, inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers n from 319 to 3183 is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me check this because sometimes when dealing with inequalities, especially with reciprocals, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me take n = 3183: 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183*3.1416) \u2248 1/10000.000, which is 0.0001. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, x = 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001, which is equivalent to n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183. Similarly, x must be less than 0.001, so 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309, so the minimum integer n is 319. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.

Since 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0), taking reciprocals (and remembering that taking reciprocals reverses the inequality because both sides are positive): 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0 So, 10000 > n\u03c0, which implies n < 10000/\u03c0.

If n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then adding 1 gives 2865. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute 3183 - 318 = 2865, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183, inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the bounds. Let me check the endpoints again. When x approaches 0.001 from the right, 1/x approaches 1000 from the left. So, the maximum n is when 1/(n\u03c0) is just less than 0.001, which would be when n is just greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, so n starts at 319. Similarly, when x approaches 0.0001 from the right, 1/x approaches 10000 from the left. So, the maximum n is when 1/(n\u03c0) is just greater than 0.0001, which would be when n is just less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618, so n goes up to 3183. Therefore, the number of n's is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me think again. Each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept in the interval, right? Because for each integer n between 319 and 3183, x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in (0.0001, 0.001). So, each n gives a unique x in that interval. Therefore, the total number is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). For x in (0.0001, 0.001), n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

    "text": " Let me compute 0.0001 in terms of fractions. 0.0001 is 10^(-4), so 0.0001 = 1/10000. So, 1/(10000) * n\u03c0 < 1, which is (n\u03c0)/10000 < 1. Then, multiplying both sides by 10000: n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute 10000 divided by \u03c0. Since \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n is an integer, n \u2264 3183.\n\nNow, let's take the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0. Then, dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) < n. 0.001 is 10^(-3), so 0.001 = 1/1000. Thus, 1 / ( (1/1000)\u03c0 ) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. So, n > approximately 318.309886184. Since n is an integer, n \u2265 319.\n\nSo, putting it together, n must satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers n are in this range. To find the number of integers from a to b inclusive, the count is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me double-check my calculations because 3183 - 319 is indeed 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the initial steps.\n\nLet me go back. The x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0), so when x is in (0.0001, 0.001), 1/(n\u03c0) must be in that interval. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and remembering that flipping the inequality signs because we're taking reciprocals of positive numbers), we get 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, dividing by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nCalculating 1000/\u03c0: 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184.\n\nCalculating 10000/\u03c0: 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, n must be integers strictly greater than 318.309886184 and strictly less than 3183.09886184. So, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest integer n is 3183.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but I just realized that when I take the reciprocal, the inequality flips. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) implies that 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0, which is 10000 > n\u03c0, so n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies that n\u03c0 > 1000, so n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184. So, n must be greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which gives 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me check with a smaller example to see if my method is correct. Suppose I have the interval (0.1, 0.2). Then, x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, 0.1 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.2. Taking reciprocals: 5 < n\u03c0 < 10. So, n\u03c0 > 5 implies n > 5/\u03c0 \u2248 1.5915, so n \u2265 2. Similarly, n\u03c0 < 10 implies n < 10/\u03c0 \u2248 3.1831, so n \u2264 3. So, n can be 2 or 3, which gives two x-intercepts. Let me compute 1/(2\u03c0) \u2248 0.15915, which is within (0.1, 0.2). 1/(3\u03c0) \u2248 0.1061, which is also within (0.1, 0.2). Wait, 0.1061 is greater than 0.1, so yes, both n=2 and n=3 give x in (0.1, 0.2). So, that's two x-intercepts. Now, using the formula: from n=2 to n=3, the number of integers is 3 - 2 + 1 = 2, which matches. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but in this case, the upper bound is 0.2, which is 1/(5\u03c0) \u2248 0.06366, which is less than 0.2, so actually, n=2 gives x\u22480.15915, which is less than 0.2, and n=3 gives x\u22480.1061, which is also less than 0.2. But wait, 1/(n\u03c0) for n=1 is 1/\u03c0 \u2248 0.318, which is greater than 0.2, so it's outside the interval. So, yes, n starts at 2. So, the formula works here.\n\nAnother test: interval (0.05, 0.1). So, 0.05 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.1. Taking reciprocals: 10 < n\u03c0 < 20. So, n > 10/\u03c0 \u2248 3.183, so n \u2265 4. n < 20/\u03c0 \u2248 6.366, so n \u2264 6. So, n=4,5,6. That's 3 integers. Let's check: 1/(4\u03c0)\u22480.07958, which is between 0.05 and 0.1. 1/(5\u03c0)\u22480.06366, also in the interval. 1/(6\u03c0)\u22480.05305, which is also in the interval. So, three x-intercepts, which matches 6 - 4 + 1 = 3. So, the formula works here too.\n\nSo, returning to the original problem, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me check again: n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, so the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because when n increases, 1/(n\u03c0) decreases, so as n increases from 319 to 3183, x decreases from approximately 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000981 (which is just under 0.001) down to 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999 (which is just above 0.0001). So, all these x-values are within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, each integer n from 319 to 3183 inclusive corresponds to exactly one x-intercept in that interval.\n\nWait, but let me check the endpoints. The interval is open: (0.0001, 0.001), so it doesn't include the endpoints.

    "text": " Let me compute 0.0001 as 1e-4, so 1e-4 * n\u03c0 < 1 => n\u03c0 < 1e4 => n < 1e4 / \u03c0. Similarly, for the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 => n\u03c0 > 1/0.001 => n\u03c0 > 1000 => n > 1000 / \u03c0. So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 and less than 1e4/\u03c0. Let me compute these values numerically. Let's compute 1000/\u03c0. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 1e4 is 10,000, so 10,000/\u03c0 \u2248 10,000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. But n has to be an integer, so n starts at the next integer after 318.309886184, which is 319, and goes up to the integer just below 3183.09886184, which is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1. Wait, no, because 319 is the starting point. Let me think. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319, and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recalculate the number of integers from 319 to 3183. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, then adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I consider that the first term is 319, and the last term is 3183, the count is (3183 - 319) + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, that's correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me think again. Since n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, inclusive, the count is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that should be the number of times sin(1/x) crosses the x-axis in that interval.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer n. Within the interval (0.0001, 0.001), n ranges from 319 to 3183, yielding 2865 intercepts.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify x-intercepts condition**: sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0).\n\n2. **Set up inequalities**: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\n3. **Solve for n**:\n   - Lower bound: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n < 10,000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098.\n   - Upper bound: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u21d2 n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309.\n\n4. **Determine integer range**: n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\n5. **Count integers**: Number of integers = 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nAnswer: The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

    "text": " Let me compute 0.0001 in terms of fractions. 0.0001 is 10^(-4), so 0.0001 = 1/10000. So, 1/(10000) * n\u03c0 < 1 => n\u03c0 < 10000. Similarly, for the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which is 1/1000. So, 1/(n\u03c0) < 1/1000. Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < n\u03c0/1000. Then, multiplying both sides by 1000: 1000 < n\u03c0. So, n\u03c0 > 1000. So now, combining both inequalities, we have: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. To find n, we can divide all parts by \u03c0. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values numerically. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be an integer strictly greater than approximately 318.309886184 and strictly less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319, and the largest possible n is 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the numbers: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Each of these n corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0) within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I converted 0.0001 and 0.001 to fractions: 1/10000 and 1/1000, correct. Then, set up the inequalities 1/(n\u03c0) > 1/10000 and 1/(n\u03c0) < 1/1000, which led to n\u03c0 < 10000 and n\u03c0 > 1000. Dividing by \u03c0 gives n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098 and n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. Then, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, sometimes people might make an off-by-one error here, so let me confirm. If n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, 2883 - 19 is 2864, then +1 is 2865. Yes, that seems right. So, the function y = sin(1/x) crosses the x-axis 2865 times between x = 0.0001 and x = 0.001. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at 1/x = n\u03c0 for integers n. Solving 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 gives n between approximately 319 and 3183. The number of integers in this range is 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

    "text": " Let me compute 0.0001 as 10^(-4). So, 10^(-4) * n\u03c0 < 1 => n < 1 / (10^(-4) * \u03c0) => n < 10^4 / \u03c0. Similarly, for the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 => 1 / (0.001\u03c0) < n => 1000 / \u03c0 < n. So, combining both inequalities, we have: 1000 / \u03c0 < n < 10^4 / \u03c0. Now, let me compute the numerical values of 1000/\u03c0 and 10^4/\u03c0. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10^4 / \u03c0 = 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.309886 and less than approximately 3183.098861. Since n has to be an integer, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183, inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1. Wait, but 319 is the starting point. So, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So here, a = 319 and b = 3183. So, number of integers = 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in that interval. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.309886, so n must be greater than that, so n starts at 319. 10^4 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.098861, so n must be less than that, so n ends at 3183. Then, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, another way to compute the number of integers between two numbers is to take the floor of the upper bound and the ceiling of the lower bound, then subtract and add 1. So, floor(10^4 / \u03c0) = 3183, and ceiling(1000 / \u03c0) = 319. Then, the count is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that seems consistent.

Let me compute 10^4 / \u03c0. 10^4 is 10,000. Dividing 10,000 by \u03c0: approximately 10,000 / 3.1416 \u2248 3183.098. So, n < 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, the maximum possible n is 3183.\n\nNow, let's take the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Similarly, multiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0. Then, divide both sides by 0.001\u03c0: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) < n. 0.001 is 10^(-3), so 1 / (10^(-3)\u03c0) = 10^3 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.309. So, n > 318.309. Since n must be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. To find the number of integers from a to b inclusive, it's b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183, inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is from 10^(-4) to 10^(-3). Each x-intercept is at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, I need 1/(n\u03c0) to be greater than 10^(-4) and less than 10^(-3). So, n must satisfy 10^3 < n\u03c0 < 10^4. Then, dividing by \u03c0, n must be between 10^3 / \u03c0 and 10^4 / \u03c0, which is approximately 318.31 and 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, which is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the function sin(1/x). As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a finite interval, how many oscillations are there? Each oscillation of sin(1/x) corresponds to a crossing of the x-axis, so each zero crossing corresponds to one x-intercept. So, the number of x-intercepts is the number of times sin(1/x) completes a half-period in that interval, which relates to how many times 1/x increases by \u03c0, since each zero crossing is \u03c0 apart in the argument.\n\nSo, let's consider the change in 1/x as x goes from 0.0001 to 0.001. The value of 1/x at x = 0.0001 is 10,000, and at x = 0.001 is 1000. So, 1/x decreases from 10,000 to 1000, a decrease of 9000. Each x-intercept occurs when 1/x decreases by \u03c0 each time, because sin(\u03b8) is zero every \u03c0 units. So, the number of zeros would be approximately the total change in 1/x divided by \u03c0, which is 9000 / \u03c0 \u2248 2866. But wait, that's a bit different from 2865. Hmm, maybe I should check again.\n\nWait, when I computed n from 319 to 3183, that's 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. But the total change in 1/x is 10,000 - 1000 = 9000. Divided by \u03c0, that's approximately 2866.06. So, the approximate number of zeros would be around 2866. But my exact calculation gave me 2865. So, perhaps I made a slight error in the exact count. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 10^4 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n must be less than that, so n_max is 3183. Similarly, 10^3 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n_min is 319. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that's correct. The approximate method gave me 2866, but the exact count is 2865. So, perhaps the exact answer is 2865.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider whether 1/(319\u03c0) is indeed greater than 0.0001 and 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.001. Let me check:\n\nCompute 1/(319\u03c0): \u03c0 \u2248 3.1416, so 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 319 * 3.1416. Let's compute 300*3.1416 = 942.48, 19*3.1416 \u2248 59.6904, so total \u2248 942.48 + 59.6904 \u2248 1002.1704. So, 1/1002.1704 \u2248 0.0009978, which is approximately 0.0009978, which is less than 0.001. Wait, but I thought 1/(319\u03c0) should be greater than 0.0001. Wait, 1/(319\u03c0) is about 0.0009978, which is 0.0009978, which is greater than 0.0001, so that's correct. But wait, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009978, which is just under 0.001, so that's within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183*3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001. Wait, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound of the interval. But the interval is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001. So, n must be less than 10^4 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, which is the lower bound. Since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001, so n must be less than 3183.098, so n can be 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, which is the lower limit, but since it's an open interval, x must be greater than 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001, so n must be less than 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, so it's excluded. Wait, but 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, so x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded because the interval is (0.0001, 0.001). So, does that mean n can only go up to 3182? Let me check.\n\nWait, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. So, if x = 1/(3183\u03c0), then x \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is not included. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, which is not included. So, the maximum n is 3182, because when n=3182, x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 slightly larger than 0.0001. Let me compute 3182\u03c0: 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's see, 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77, 182\u03c0 \u2248 571.78, so total \u2248 9424.77 + 571.78 \u2248 10,000. So, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 10,000 - \u03c0, which is approximately 10,000 - 3.1416 \u2248 9996.8584. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.8584 \u2248 0.00010003, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n can be 319 up to 3183, but wait, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded, so n must be up to 3182. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182, inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. Wait, that's different from before. So, earlier I thought n went up to 3183, but now I see that n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is excluded, so n should only go up to 3182. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. Hmm, this is conflicting with my earlier conclusion.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the exact values. Let's compute 1/(3183\u03c0) and see if it's less than or equal to 0.0001. Let's compute 3183 * \u03c0: 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 183\u03c0 \u2248 574.45625, so total \u2248 9424.77796 + 574.45625 \u2248 9999.23421. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.23421 \u2248 0.0001000077, which is approximately 0.0001000077, which is just over 0.0001. So, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000077, which is greater than 0.0001, so it is included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 is acceptable because x=1/(3183\u03c0) is just over 0.0001. Therefore, n can go up to 3183. So, the initial calculation was correct: n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but when I computed 3183\u03c0, I got approximately 9999.234, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000077, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, n=3183 is acceptable, so the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about it as the number of zeros is floor(1000/\u03c0) - ceil(10000/\u03c0). Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, let me think differently. The zeros occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0), so for x in (0.0001, 0.001), which is (10^(-4), 10^(-3)), the corresponding n must satisfy 10^3 < n\u03c0 < 10^4, so n must satisfy 10^3 / \u03c0 < n < 10^4 / \u03c0. So, n must be greater than 10^3 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and less than 10^4 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. Therefore, n can be integers from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that 1/(3183\u03c0) is just over 0.0001, so it's included. So, n=3183 is acceptable, so 3183 is included, making the total number 2865. Therefore, the final answer is 2865.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has zeros where 1/x = n\u03c0 for integers n. For x in (0.0001, 0.001), n ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 x-intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

Let me compute 10^4 / \u03c0. 10^4 is 10,000. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 10,000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n < approximately 3183.0988618. Since n must be an integer, the maximum possible n is 3183. Now, let's take the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Similarly, multiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 => 1 < n\u03c0 * 0.001 => n\u03c0 > 1000 => n > 1000 / \u03c0. Calculating 1000 / \u03c0: 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618.

    "text": " Maybe I should invert the inequality to make it easier. Since 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0), taking reciprocals (and remembering to reverse the inequality because both sides are positive): 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0 So, 10000 > n\u03c0, which means n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.14159265, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is about 10000 / 3.14159265 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n is an integer, n \u2264 3183. Now, let's look at the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Taking reciprocals again: 1/0.001 > n\u03c0, which is 1000 > n\u03c0. So, n < 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 / 3.14159265 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be less than approximately 318.30988618, meaning n \u2264 318. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let me check my steps again because I think I might have made a mistake in interpreting the inequalities. Let me start over. We have 0.0001 < x < 0.001, and x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, substituting, we get 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me solve each inequality separately. First inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Multiply both sides by n\u03c0: 0.0001 * n\u03c0 < 1. Then, divide both sides by 0.0001: n\u03c0 < 1 / 0.0001 = 10000. So, n\u03c0 < 10000, which gives n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n can be up to 3183. Second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Multiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0. Then, divide both sides by 0.001: 1000 < n\u03c0. So, n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618. Since n must be an integer, n \u2265 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers in this range, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Wait, that seems correct? Let me check the calculations again. 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183, inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in setting up the inequalities. Let me take a specific example. Let's pick n = 319. Then, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.768) \u2248 0.00099725. Is 0.00099725 greater than 0.0001? Yes, it's about 0.000997, which is less than 0.001. Wait, 0.000997 is less than 0.001, so that's correct. Now, n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.00018) \u2248 0.00009999998, which is just a bit less than 0.0001, but wait, the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999998 is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, n must be such that x > 0.0001, which is 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, so n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618, so n can be up to 3183, but x must be greater than 0.0001, so x = 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 10000/\u03c0, which is about 3183.0988618, so n can be 3183, but let's check x when n=3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.00018) \u2248 0.00009999998, which is less than 0.0001, so n=3183 gives x just below 0.0001, which is outside the interval. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.0988618, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but x for n=3183 is just below 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n such that x > 0.0001 is n=3182. Let me check n=3182: x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.00000) \u2248 0.0001, which is exactly 0.0001, but the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001, not equal to it. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.0988618, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, the maximum n is 3182. Wait, no, wait: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618, so n can be up to 3183, but when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999998 < 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. So, n must satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3182. Therefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. Wait, that's different from my earlier count. So, where did I go wrong before? I think I included n=3183, but x for n=3183 is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, n goes from 319 to 3182, inclusive. So, the number of terms is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. Let me verify this again. The lower bound is n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, so n starts at 319. The upper bound is n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618, so n goes up to 3183, but n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999998 < 0.0001, which is outside the interval, so n must be up to 3182. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863. Then, 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, there are 2864 integer values of n between 319 and 3182 inclusive. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me double-check with another approach. The function sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. The number of oscillations increases as x gets smaller. The interval (0.0001, 0.001) is from 10^{-4} to 10^{-3}. The zeros of sin(1/x) occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, for x in (10^{-4}, 10^{-3}), we have 10^{-4} < 1/(n\u03c0) < 10^{-3}. Taking reciprocals and reversing inequalities: 10^{3} > n\u03c0 > 10^{4}. So, 1000 > n\u03c0 > 10000. Wait, that can't be right because 10000 is greater than 1000. Wait, no, actually, when taking reciprocals, the inequalities reverse. So, from 10^{-4} < 1/(n\u03c0) < 10^{-3}, taking reciprocals gives 10^{3} > n\u03c0 > 10^{4}. Wait, that can't be correct because 10^{3} is 1000 and 10^{4} is 10000, but 1000 > 10000 is false. So, I must have made a mistake in taking reciprocals. Let me correct that. Starting with 10^{-4} < 1/(n\u03c0) < 10^{-3}, taking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities) gives 10^{3} < n\u03c0 < 10^{4}. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating these: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be an integer between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Now, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Wait, but earlier I thought that n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999998, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, n should go up to 3182, giving 2864 intercepts. But according to this reciprocal method, n can be up to 3183, but that would include x=1/(3183\u03c0) which is less than 0.0001. So, there's a discrepancy here. Let me clarify: The original interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open. So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. Therefore, 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities): 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618 and less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. However, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999998, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, giving x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010000001, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. The number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier when I considered the reciprocal method, I thought n goes up to 3183, but that gives x less than 0.0001, which is excluded. So, the correct upper limit for n is 3182, giving 2864 intercepts. Therefore, the final answer is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe number of x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is found by determining the integer values of n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies within the interval. Solving the inequalities, we find that n ranges from 319 to 3182, inclusive. The total number of integers in this range is 2864.\n\n\\boxed{2864}"

    "text": " Maybe it's easier to rearrange for n. Let's invert both sides, remembering that inverting reverses the inequality: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0 > 1/0.001 So, 10000 > n\u03c0 > 1000. Then, dividing each part by \u03c0: 10000/\u03c0 > n > 1000/\u03c0. Let me compute those values numerically. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. Similarly, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618 and less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n has to be an integer, n can take integer values from the next integer after 318.30988618, which is 319, up to the integer less than 3183.0988618, which is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, if a = 319 and b = 3183, then the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I set x = 1/(n\u03c0) and substituted into the interval. Then, I inverted the inequalities correctly, which gave me the bounds for n\u03c0, and then I divided by \u03c0 to get n. Then, I computed the approximate values correctly. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. Then, the count is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of it as starting from n = 1, up to n = 3183, which would give 3183 x-intercepts, and then subtracting the number of x-intercepts before n = 319, which is 318, so 3183 - 318 = 2865. Wait, no, that might not be the right approach because n starts at 1, so the number of x-intercepts up to n = k is k, so from n = 1 to n = 3183, it's 3183 x-intercepts. Then, from n = 1 to n = 318, it's 318 x-intercepts. So, the number in the interval would be 3183 - 318 = 2865. That's consistent with my earlier calculation. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, let me check if there are any possible issues. For example, does x = 1/(n\u03c0) always lie within (0.0001, 0.001)? Well, when n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.03) \u2248 0.000998, which is just under 0.001. Similarly, when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, which is just above 0.0001. So, both endpoints are included in the interval, but since the interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), we need to check if x = 1/(n\u03c0) is strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. So, for n = 318, x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.0) \u2248 0.001, but since 318\u03c0 \u2248 1000.0, so x \u2248 0.001, which is the upper bound, but the interval is open, so x must be less than 0.001, so n = 318 would give x \u2248 0.001, which is not included. Similarly, n = 319 gives x \u2248 0.000998, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Similarly, for the lower bound, n = 3183 gives x \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001. So, n = 3183 gives x \u2248 0.0001, which is not included. So, the smallest n that gives x > 0.0001 is n = 3183, but wait, when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) = 0.0001, which is exactly the lower bound, but since the interval is open, we need x > 0.0001. So, actually, n must be less than 3183, because if n = 3183, x = 0.0001, which is excluded. So, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me correct that. So, x must be greater than 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than 3183.0988618, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but since n must be less than that value, actually, n can be up to 3183, because 3183 < 3183.0988618, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010001, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. Similarly, n = 319 gives x \u2248 0.000998, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's correct. Let me just confirm with an example. Let's take n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.03) \u2248 0.000998, which is within (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n = 3183: x \u2248 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, but since it's open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so n = 3183 gives x \u2248 0.00010001, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. So, the count remains 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n gives n between approximately 318.31 and 3183.09. The integers n range from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

    "text": " Let me compute 0.0001 in terms of fractions. 0.0001 is 1/10000, so 1/(10000) * n\u03c0 < 1. Multiplying both sides by 10000: n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that. Since \u03c0 is approximately 3.1416, 10000/3.1416 \u2248 3183.098. So, n < approximately 3183.098. Since n is an integer, the maximum integer n can be is 3183. Now, let's take the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, multiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0. Then, divide both sides by 0.001\u03c0: 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n. Since 0.001 is 1/1000, 1/(0.001\u03c0) is 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, n > approximately 318.309. Since n is an integer, the smallest integer n can be is 319. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. Now, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in (0.0001, 0.001). But wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. When I took 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, that's equivalent to n\u03c0 < 10000, so n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n = 1 to 3183. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n = 319 to 3183. Therefore, the number of n's is 3183 - 318 = 2865. Wait, no, because n starts at 319, so 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me calculate 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864, then add 1: 2865. Yeah, that's correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me think again. Is there a possibility that when x approaches 0.0001 from the right, 1/x approaches 10000, and as x approaches 0.001 from the left, 1/x approaches 1000. So, the function sin(1/x) oscillates between -1 and 1 as x approaches 0, but in this interval, from x=0.0001 to x=0.001, 1/x goes from 10000 down to 1000. So, the function sin(1/x) will cross zero each time 1/x passes through an integer multiple of \u03c0. So, the number of zeros is the number of times 1/x passes through n\u03c0 in the range from 1000 to 10000. So, n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which is the same as 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.309 < n < 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Yeah, that seems consistent. So, I think the answer is 2865. But just to be thorough, let me check with specific values. For example, when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.06) \u2248 0.0009969, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. When n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, but since the interval is open at 0.0001, we need to check if x=1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but exactly, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 3183*3.1415926535 \u2248 let me compute that. 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, 3183 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 approximately 3183 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0928. So total \u2248 318.3 + 127.32 + 5.0928 \u2248 450.7128. So total \u03c0*3183 \u2248 9549 + 450.7128 \u2248 9999.7128. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.7128 \u2248 0.0001000028, which is just slightly above 0.0001. So, since our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, does x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u22480.0001000028 count? Since it's greater than 0.0001, yes, it does. So, n=3183 is included. Similarly, for n=319, x\u22480.0009969, which is less than 0.001, so it's included as well. Therefore, the count from n=319 to n=3183 inclusive is correct, giving us 2865 x-intercepts. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n gives 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

    "text": " Let me calculate 0.0001 * \u03c0 first. 0.0001 is 10^-4, so 10^-4 * \u03c0 \u2248 0.000314159. So, 0.000314159 * n < 1. Therefore, n < 1 / 0.000314159 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.098. Since n is an integer, n \u2264 3183.\n\nNow, let's take the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, multiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0. Then, divide both sides by 0.001\u03c0: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) < n. Calculating 0.001\u03c0 \u2248 0.00314159. So, 1 / 0.00314159 \u2248 318.309. Therefore, n > approximately 318.309. Since n is an integer, n \u2265 319.\n\nSo, n must be an integer such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Now, I need to count how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is given by b - a + 1. So, plugging in the numbers: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, let me compute 3183 - 319 first. 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then minus 19 more is 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, 2865 integers. But wait, does that make sense? Let me think about the interval (0.0001, 0.001). The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0 because 1/x becomes very large. So, in the interval from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is from x = 1/10000 to x = 1/1000, the function sin(1/x) will oscillate between -1 and 1 rapidly as x decreases towards 0.0001. Each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the sine function completes a half-period, so the number of zeros should be approximately the number of times 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0 in that interval.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute the number of zeros by considering how many times 1/x passes through multiples of \u03c0 as x goes from 0.0001 to 0.001. Let me compute 1/x at both ends: At x = 0.001, 1/x = 1000. At x = 0.0001, 1/x = 10000. So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000 as x goes from 0.001 to 0.0001. Wait, but that's the opposite direction. Wait, as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000. So, 1/x goes from 10000 down to 1000. So, the values of \u03b8 = 1/x go from 10000 to 1000 as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001. So, sin(\u03b8) will cross zero each time \u03b8 passes through a multiple of \u03c0. So, the number of zeros is the number of multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. Wait, but since \u03b8 is decreasing from 10000 to 1000, the number of zeros would be the number of integers n where n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000.\n\nWait, but earlier I had n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which corresponds to n between approximately 318.309 and 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, the number of zeros of sin(1/x) in (a, b) is equal to the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (a, b). So, 1/(n\u03c0) > a and 1/(n\u03c0) < b. Which leads to n < 1/(a\u03c0) and n > 1/(b\u03c0). So, n must be between 1/(b\u03c0) and 1/(a\u03c0). Let me compute 1/(b\u03c0) and 1/(a\u03c0) for a = 0.0001 and b = 0.001.\n\nFirst, 1/(b\u03c0) = 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 1/0.00314159 \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, so n \u2265 319.\n\nSimilarly, 1/(a\u03c0) = 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 1/0.000314159 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so n \u2264 3183.\n\nSo, the integers n run from 319 to 3183. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\n2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nSo, 2865 integers. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but let me think again. When x approaches 0 from the positive side, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), it's a finite interval, so the number of oscillations should be finite. But 2865 seems like a lot, but considering that from 1000 to 10000, the difference is 9000, and each zero crossing is every \u03c0 \u2248 3.14159 units, so the number of crossings would be roughly 9000 / \u03c0 \u2248 2866. That's very close to 2865, which makes sense because we're dealing with integer values of n.\n\nWait, let me compute 10000 - 1000 = 9000. So, the number of multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000 is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0). Let's compute 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so floor(3183.098) = 3183. Similarly, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so ceil(318.309) = 319. So, the number of n's is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That matches the earlier calculation.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: The number of zeros is the number of times sin(1/x) crosses zero as x goes from 0.001 to 0.0001. Each zero crossing occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, for each n from 319 to 3183, there's a corresponding x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, the count is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me check again.\n\nWait, when x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000. So, the values of \u03b8 = 1/x go from 10000 down to 1000. So, the zeros occur at \u03b8 = n\u03c0, where n is an integer. So, the smallest \u03b8 in this interval is 1000, the largest is 10000. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that n\u03c0 \u2265 1000 and n\u03c0 \u2264 10000. So, n \u2265 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n starts at 319. Similarly, n \u2264 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n ends at 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it as the difference between floor(10000/\u03c0) and ceil(1000/\u03c0). Let me compute 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so floor is 3183. 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so ceil is 319. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that each n from 319 to 3183 gives a unique x in (0.0001, 0.001). For n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.32) \u2248 0.0009966, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. For n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.01) \u2248 0.000099999, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's also within the interval. So, all these x's are indeed in (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but let me check n=3183: 3183\u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77, 183\u03c0 \u2248 575.01, so total \u2248 9424.77 + 575.01 \u2248 10,000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000. So, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10000 = 0.0001, but since it's 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000.01, x \u2248 0.000099999, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nSimilarly, n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 1003.32, so x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009966, which is just below 0.001, so it's included.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when n increases by 1, x decreases by a small amount. So, each n corresponds to exactly one x in the interval, and there are no overlaps or gaps. Therefore, the count should be accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the number of zeros by considering the length of the interval in terms of \u03b8. \u03b8 goes from 1000 to 10000, which is a span of 9000. Each zero occurs every \u03c0 units, so the number of zeros is approximately 9000 / \u03c0 \u2248 2866.16. Since we can't have a fraction of a zero, we take the integer part, which would be 2866. But wait, that's slightly different from 2865. Hmm, so which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the exact count is 2865, because when we take floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0) + 1, we get 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Alternatively, 9000 / \u03c0 \u2248 2866.16, which would suggest 2866 zeros. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, let's compute it more precisely. Let me compute 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0 with more precision.\n\n\u03c0 \u2248 3.141592653589793.\n\nCompute 1000 / \u03c0:\n\n1000 \u00f7 3.141592653589793 \u2248 318.309886184\n\nSo, ceil(318.309886184) = 319.\n\nCompute 10000 / \u03c0:\n\n10000 \u00f7 3.141592653589793 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, floor(3183.09886184) = 3183.\n\nSo, the number of integers n is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nAlternatively, the number of zeros is the number of n where n\u03c0 is in [1000, 10000]. So, the smallest n is 319, because 319\u03c0 \u2248 1003.32, which is greater than 1000. The largest n is 3183, because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.01, which is less than 10000? Wait, no, 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10000.01, which is just over 10000, so 3183\u03c0 > 10000, so the largest n such that n\u03c0 \u2264 10000 is 3183 - 1 = 3182, because 3182\u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.14159265 \u2248 let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77, 182\u03c0 \u2248 571.96, so total \u2248 9424.77 + 571.96 \u2248 9996.73, which is less than 10000. So, n=3182 gives \u03b8=9996.73, which is less than 10000, and n=3183 gives \u03b8\u224810000.01, which is just over 10000. So, the largest n is 3182.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with my earlier calculation. Wait, if n=3183 gives \u03b8=3183\u03c0\u224810000.01, which is just over 10000, so n=3183 is excluded. Therefore, the largest n is 3182. So, the number of n's would be from 319 to 3182, inclusive.\n\nSo, the count would be 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n=3183 was included because x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000099999, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. But \u03b8=3183\u03c0\u224810000.01, which is just above 10000, so does that count? Since \u03b8 is decreasing from 10000 to 1000, the zeros occur at \u03b8=n\u03c0 where n is an integer. So, n=3183 would correspond to \u03b8=3183\u03c0\u224810000.01, which is just beyond the upper limit of \u03b8=10000. So, does that count as a zero within the interval?\n\nWait, \u03b8=10000 is the upper limit, but it's not included because x=0.0001 is excluded. So, \u03b8=10000 corresponds to x=0.0001, which is not included. Therefore, the zeros occur at \u03b8=n\u03c0 < 10000, so n must be less than 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.098, so n=3183 is excluded because 3183\u03c0\u224810000.01>10000. Therefore, n goes up to 3182.\n\nSimilarly, at the lower end, \u03b8=1000 corresponds to x=0.001, which is excluded, so n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0\u2248318.309, so n starts at 319.\n\nTherefore, the number of n's is from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, 3182 - 319 + 1 = 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier when I considered x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000099999, which is just above 0.0001, so x=0.000099999 is in (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, no: 0.000099999 is 0.000099999, which is less than 0.0001. Wait, 0.0001 is 0.0001, so 0.000099999 is just below 0.0001, so it's not included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 corresponds to x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the largest n is 3182, which gives x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.000099999... Wait, no, let me compute 1/(3182\u03c0):\n\n3182\u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.14159265 \u2248 let's compute 3000\u03c0\u22489424.77, 182\u03c0\u2248571.96, so total\u22489424.77 + 571.96\u22489996.73. So, 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22481/9996.73\u22480.0001000325. So, that's just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3182 is included because x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.0001000325>0.0001.\n\nWait, so n=3182 gives x\u22480.0001000325, which is in (0.0001, 0.001). Then, n=3183 gives x\u22480.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nSimilarly, n=319 gives x\u22481/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009966, which is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nSo, the number of n's is from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the count is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 3182 - 319 = 2863 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let's check with specific numbers:\n\nCompute 1000/\u03c0\u2248318.309886184, so the first integer n is 319.\n\nCompute 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.09886184, so the last integer n is 3183.\n\nBut 3183\u03c0\u224810000.01, which is just over 10000, so n=3183 is excluded because \u03b8=10000.01>10000. Therefore, the last included n is 3182, because 3182\u03c0\u22489996.73<10000.\n\nTherefore, the number of n's is from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the count is 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\nCompute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863.\n\nThen, 2863 + 1 = 2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865 because I included n=3183, but now I realize n=3183 is excluded because \u03b8=3183\u03c0\u224810000.01>10000, so x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000099999<0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the correct count is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another approach. The number of zeros is the number of integers n where 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nDividing by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nSo, 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184.\n\nTherefore, n can be 319, 320, ..., 3183.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but this contradicts the earlier conclusion where n=3183 was excluded because \u03b8=3183\u03c0>10000.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering whether \u03b8=3183\u03c0 is included or not. Since \u03b8=10000 is the upper limit, but \u03b8 must be less than 10000 because x=0.0001 is excluded. So, \u03b8=3183\u03c0\u224810000.01>10000, so n=3183 is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, so the count is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but according to the inequality 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, n must be less than 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but since 3183\u03c0\u224810000.01>10000, it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nTherefore, the number of n's is from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but I'm confused because using the inequality 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, n can be up to 3183, but since 3183\u03c0 is over 10000, it's excluded, so n goes up to 3182.\n\nTherefore, the count is 2864.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the floor function. The number of integers n where n\u03c0 > 1000 and n\u03c0 < 10000 is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0).\n\nCompute floor(10000/\u03c0) = floor(3183.09886184) = 3183.\n\nCompute ceil(1000/\u03c0) = ceil(318.309886184) = 319.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but this counts n=3183, which gives \u03b8=3183\u03c0\u224810000.01>10000, which is outside the interval. So, perhaps the correct formula is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0).\n\nBut floor(10000/\u03c0)=3183, ceil(1000/\u03c0)=319, so 3183 - 319 = 2864, and since we include both endpoints, we add 1, getting 2865.\n\nBut wait, if n=3183 is excluded because \u03b8=3183\u03c0>10000, then the correct count should be 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0) + 1, but in this case, since n=3183 is excluded, it's 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nI think the confusion comes from whether n=3183 is included or not. Since \u03b8=3183\u03c0\u224810000.01>10000, it's outside the interval, so n=3183 is excluded. Therefore, the count is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me think differently: The number of zeros is the number of times \u03b8 crosses a multiple of \u03c0 between \u03b8=1000 and \u03b8=10000. Each zero crossing occurs at \u03b8=n\u03c0, where n is an integer. So, starting from \u03b8=1000, the next zero is at \u03b8=ceil(1000/\u03c0)*\u03c0\u2248319\u03c0\u22481003.32. The previous zero before \u03b8=10000 is at \u03b8=floor(10000/\u03c0)*\u03c0\u22483183\u03c0\u224810000.01, but since \u03b8 must be less than 10000, the last zero is at \u03b8=3182\u03c0\u22489996.73.\n\nTherefore, the number of zeros is the number of integers n where 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3182.\n\nSo, the count is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier when I used the formula floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0) + 1, I got 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865, but that includes n=3183, which is excluded. So, the correct count is 2864.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 2864.\n\nBut wait, to make sure, let me compute 3182 - 319 + 1:\n\n3182 - 319 = 2863\n\n2863 + 1 = 2864\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) crosses the x-axis whenever 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. The number of zeros is the number of integers n where n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000. This gives n from 319 to 3182, resulting in 2864 x-intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2864}$"

Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0. Then, dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n. Calculating 1/(0.001\u03c0): 0.001 is 1e-3, so 1/(1e-3\u03c0) = 1e3 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.3098. So, n > approximately 318.3098. But n must be an integer, so n \u2265 319. Now, from the first inequality, n\u03c0 < 1e4, so n < 1e4 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1416 \u2248 3183.098. Since n must be less than this, n \u2264 3183. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, substituting a = 319 and b = 3183: Number of x-intercepts = 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 gives 2865. Wait, let me check that calculation again. 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 x-intercepts in that interval. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. Let me double-check the calculations. Starting with x = 1/(n\u03c0). The interval is 0.0001 < x < 0.001. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and remembering that reversing the inequalities because reciprocals reverse the order for positive numbers): 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, dividing all parts by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098, so n > 318.3098, so n \u2265 319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n < 3183.098, so n \u2264 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 = 2864; 2864 +1 = 2865.

Let me take reciprocals, remembering that taking reciprocals reverses the inequalities because all terms are positive. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. That is, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Now, dividing each part by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let's compute these.\n\n1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.14159 \u2248 318.309. So, n > 318.309, so n \u2265 319.\n\n10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.14159 \u2248 3183.098. So, n < 3183.098, so n \u2264 3183.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Does each n correspond to exactly one x-intercept? Yes, because for each integer n, x = 1/(n\u03c0) is a unique point in the interval. So, the number of x-intercepts is equal to the number of integers n in that range, which is 2865.\n\nBut wait, let me check if x = 1/(n\u03c0) is indeed within (0.0001, 0.001). For n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.37) \u2248 0.0009976, which is just under 0.001, so it's included. For n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.00) \u2248 0.0001, which is exactly 0.0001. But our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so we need x strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. So, does n = 319 give x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009976, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Similarly, n = 3183 gives x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since the interval is open at 0.0001, we need to check if x is greater than 0.0001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n can be up to 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000... So, is that greater than 0.0001? Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0):\n\n3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 Let's compute 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.14159265 \u2248 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.04159265 \u2248 approximately 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, and 3183 * 0.00159265 \u2248 ~5.06. So total \u2248 318.3 + 127.32 + 5.06 \u2248 450.68. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9549 + 450.68 \u2248 9999.68. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.68 \u2248 0.000100003. So, that's just slightly above 0.0001, so it is included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, for n = 319, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.37) \u2248 0.0009976, which is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nWait, but earlier when I took reciprocals, I had 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, leading to n between 319 and 3183. So, that seems correct. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nBut let me think again: does each n from 319 to 3183 inclusive correspond to exactly one x-intercept in the interval? Yes, because each x = 1/(n\u03c0) is unique and lies within (0.0001, 0.001). So, the total number is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to see if my approach is correct. Suppose I wanted to find the number of x-intercepts in (0.1, 0.2). Then, 0.1 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.2. Taking reciprocals: 5 < n\u03c0 < 10, so n between 5/\u03c0 \u2248 1.59 and 10/\u03c0 \u2248 3.18. So, n = 2 and 3. So, x-intercepts at 1/(2\u03c0) \u2248 0.159 and 1/(3\u03c0) \u2248 0.106, which are both between 0.1 and 0.2. So, two x-intercepts. Using the formula: n from 2 to 3 inclusive, so 3 - 2 + 1 = 2. That works.\n\nAnother example: interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, using the same method, we get 2865 x-intercepts. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation of 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), we find the range of n by solving 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, leading to n between 319 and 3183. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

Let me compute that. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n < approximately 3183.0988618. Since n is an integer, n \u2264 3183.\n\nNow, let's take the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Similarly, taking reciprocals (and flipping the inequality): n\u03c0 > 1/0.001 = 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n > approximately 318.30988618. Since n is an integer, n \u2265 319.\n\nSo, n must be an integer such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Now, I need to count how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, it's 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n in that range, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, starting with y = sin(1/x), x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which implies 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). Then, substituting into the interval 0.0001 < x < 0.001, leading to 1/(n\u03c0) between 0.0001 and 0.001, which gives n between approximately 318.31 and 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1, which is 2865. That seems correct. I don't see any errors in the reasoning.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me check the endpoints. When n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.818) \u2248 0.000996, which is just under 0.001, so it's included.

So, substituting x = 1/(n\u03c0), we get 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, solving for n:\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, we get n < 1/(0.0001 * \u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988618.\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, we get n > 1/(0.001 * \u03c0) \u2248 318.30988618.\n\nSo, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but I should check whether 1/(319\u03c0) is indeed greater than 0.001 and 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001.\n\nCalculating 1/(319\u03c0): 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 1003.0988618. So, 1/1003.0988618 \u2248 0.00099694, which is approximately 0.000997, which is just below 0.001. Wait, but 0.000997 is less than 0.001, so 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000997 < 0.001, which is correct because x must be less than 0.001.\n\nSimilarly, 1/(3183\u03c0): 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 10000. So, 1/10000 = 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000, 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001, which is correct because x must be greater than 0.0001.\n\nSo, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check the exact value of 3183\u03c0. 3183 * \u03c0 = 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute that more accurately.\n\n3183 * 3 = 9549\n3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3\n3183 * 0.0415926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32\n3183 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 ~5.06\nSo, adding those: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.06 \u2248 450.68\nSo total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9549 + 450.68 \u2248 9999.68\n\nSo, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.68, which is just under 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.68 \u2248 0.0001000032, which is just over 0.0001. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000032 > 0.0001, so x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is just above 0.0001, which is within our interval.\n\nSimilarly, 1/(319\u03c0): Let's compute 319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 319 * 3 = 957, 319 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 45.07. So total \u2248 957 + 45.07 \u2248 1002.07. So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.07 \u2248 0.0009979, which is just under 0.001, so it's within the interval.\n\nSo, both endpoints are included, so n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again: Is this correct? Because between 0.0001 and 0.001, the function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. So, near x=0.0001, the function is oscillating very rapidly, but between 0.0001 and 0.001, how many times does it cross zero?\n\nEach time 1/x increases by \u03c0, x decreases by a certain amount. So, the number of zeros is roughly the change in 1/x divided by \u03c0, scaled appropriately.\n\nLet me see: The change in 1/x from x=0.0001 to x=0.001 is from 10000 to 1000, so the change is 9000. So, the number of zeros would be approximately 9000 / \u03c0 \u2248 2866. But wait, my earlier calculation gave 2865, which is very close. So, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but 9000 / \u03c0 \u2248 2866.197, which is about 2866, but my exact count gave 2865. Hmm, maybe because when n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, perhaps the approximation is 2866, but the exact count is 2865. That makes sense because when you take the floor and ceiling functions, you might lose a count here or there.\n\nWait, let me check: If I take 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, so n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988618, so n can be up to 3183. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, so n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.30988618, so n starts at 319.\n\nSo, the number of integers is from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nSo, I think that's correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check with specific values. For example, when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009979, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. When n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000032, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me compute 3183 - 319:\n\n3183 - 300 = 2883\n\n2883 - 19 = 2864\n\nSo, 2864 + 1 = 2865.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

Similarly, for the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals again: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values numerically. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. Similarly, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618 and less than approximately 3183.0988618.

Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, substituting a = 319 and b = 3183, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I set sin(1/x) = 0, which gives 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). Then, I substituted into the interval 0.0001 < x < 0.001, leading to 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Then, I correctly inverted the inequalities to find n > 1000/\u03c0 and n < 10000/\u03c0, which gave me n between approximately 318.31 and 3183.098. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct. Hmm, but just to make sure, let me check with n=319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.8) \u2248 0.000996, which is approximately 0.001, but just a bit less. Wait, 0.000996 is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Similarly, for n=3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, which is exactly the lower bound, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, does x=0.0001 count? Wait, the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, x=0.0001 is excluded, and x=0.001 is also excluded. So, we need to ensure that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, for n=319: 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000996 < 0.001, which is good. For n=3183: 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is equal to the lower bound, but since it's open, we need to check if 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than that, meaning the maximum integer n is 3183, but we need to check if 1/(3183\u03c0) > 0.0001. Let's compute 1/(3183\u03c0): 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since 3183 * \u03c0 is slightly more than 10000, because 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 10000.000000... wait, actually, 3183 * \u03c0 is exactly 10000 if \u03c0 were exactly 10000/3183, but \u03c0 is irrational, so it's actually slightly more. Therefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001, which would place it outside the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, that means n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. Wait, that changes things. Let me recast this. So, I need 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me solve for n in both inequalities. First, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n\u03c0 < 10000 => n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. Since n must be less than that, the maximum integer n is 3183, but as we saw, 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001, so it doesn't satisfy the inequality. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. Similarly, for the lower bound: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n\u03c0 > 1000 => n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618. So, the smallest integer n is 319. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Now, let's compute the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Using the formula: 3182 - 319 + 1 = 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 +1 = 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, that's different from my earlier count. So, where did I go wrong earlier? I think I included n=3183, but that actually gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, n goes up to 3182. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864. Let me double-check with n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0). Let's compute 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.14159265 \u2248 3182 * 3.14159265. Let's compute 3000*3.14159265=9424.77795, and 182*3.14159265\u2248182*3=546, 182*0.14159265\u224825.764, so total\u2248546+25.764\u2248571.764. So, total\u22489424.77795 + 571.764\u22489996.54195. So, 3182\u03c0\u22489996.54195, so 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22481/9996.54195\u22480.0001000345. Wait, that's just over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.0001000345, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, n=3182 is included, but n=3183 is excluded. So, the maximum n is 3182. Therefore, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864. So, the correct number of x-intercepts is 2864. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 gives 2864. Yes, that's correct. So, the answer is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. To find the number of such x in (0.0001, 0.001), we solve for n:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u21d2 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3182. The number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\n$\\boxed{2864}$"

    "text": " Let's compute 0.0001 as 1e-4, so 1e-4 * n\u03c0 < 1 => n\u03c0 < 1e4 => n < 1e4 / \u03c0. Similarly, for the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 => n\u03c0 > 1/0.001 => n\u03c0 > 1000 => n > 1000 / \u03c0. So, putting it together, n must satisfy: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 1e4/\u03c0. Let me compute these values numerically. First, \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 1e4 is 10,000, so 1e4/\u03c0 \u2248 10,000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183. Now, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me check my calculation again. Alternatively, another way to count the number of integers between a and b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, if a is 319 and b is 3183, then 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 2865 integers n such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the range. Let me double-check the inequalities. Starting with x in (0.0001, 0.001), which is equivalent to 1e-4 < x < 1e-3. Then, x = 1/(n\u03c0), so 1e-4 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 1e-3. Taking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities because reciprocating positive numbers reverses the inequality): 1e3 > n\u03c0 > 1e4. Wait, that seems conflicting with what I did earlier. Wait, no, let me see: If 1e-4 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 1e-3, then taking reciprocals: 1/(1e-3) > n\u03c0 > 1/(1e-4), which is 1000 > n\u03c0 > 10,000. Wait, that can't be right because 1/(1e-3) is 1000, and 1/(1e-4) is 10,000. But that would imply that n\u03c0 is between 10,000 and 1000, which is impossible because 10,000 is larger than 1000. So, I must have messed up the inequality direction when taking reciprocals. Let me correct that. The original inequality is 1e-4 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 1e-3. Taking reciprocals (and remembering that taking reciprocals reverses inequalities for positive numbers), we get: 1/(1e-3) < n\u03c0 < 1/(1e-4), which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10,000. Ah, that makes more sense. So, n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10,000. Therefore, n must be between 1000/\u03c0 and 10,000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183, as I initially thought. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that seems correct. Wait, but let me make sure that when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is still greater than 0.0001. Let me compute 1/(3183 * \u03c0). Let's approximate \u03c0 as 3.1415926535, so 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, and 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 574.7697, so total \u2248 9424.77796 + 574.7697 \u2248 10,000 (approximately). So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10,000 = 0.0001. But our interval is x > 0.0001, so x must be greater than 0.0001, so x = 0.0001 is excluded. So, n must be less than 1e4/\u03c0, which is approximately 3183.09886184, so n can be up to 3183 because 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, we need 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which implies n < 1e4/\u03c0, so n can be up to 3183 because 3183 is less than 3183.09886184. So, n = 3183 is acceptable because 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, and 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001? Wait, no, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10,000 = 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10,000, 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, which is outside our interval. Wait, that's a problem. So, maybe n can only go up to 3182. Let me check that.\n\nWait, let me compute 3183 * \u03c0 more accurately. Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0:\n\nFirst, 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796\nThen, 183 * \u03c0: 183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 183 * 3 = 549, 183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 180 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 25.48667763, and 3 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 0.42477796. So total \u2248 25.48667763 + 0.42477796 \u2248 25.91145559. So, 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 549 + 25.91145559 \u2248 574.91145559.\n\nSo, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796 + 574.91145559 \u2248 9999.6894156.\n\nSo, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 9999.6894, which is just under 10,000. Therefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.6894 \u2248 0.00010000314, which is just over 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010000314, which is greater than 0.0001, so it is within our interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n = 3183 is acceptable because x is greater than 0.0001.\n\nSimilarly, let's check n = 319: 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 300 * \u03c0 \u2248 942.477796, and 19 * \u03c0 \u2248 59.69026042. So, total \u2248 942.477796 + 59.69026042 \u2248 1002.168056. So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.168056 \u2248 0.00099785, which is less than 0.001, so it's within our interval.\n\nWait, but 0.00099785 is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n = 319 gives x \u2248 0.00099785, which is within the interval. Similarly, n = 3183 gives x \u2248 0.000100003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that 1/(3183\u03c0) is just over 0.0001, so it's included. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 gives 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check if n = 3183 is included. Since 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.6894, which is less than 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100003, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Similarly, n = 319 gives x \u2248 0.00099785, which is less than 0.001, so included.\n\nWait, but let me check n = 3184: 3184 * \u03c0 \u2248 3184 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute that: 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 184 * \u03c0 \u2248 184 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 180 * \u03c0 \u2248 565.4866776, and 4 * \u03c0 \u2248 12.56637061. So, total \u2248 565.4866776 + 12.56637061 \u2248 578.0530482. So, 3184 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796 + 578.0530482 \u2248 9999.831008. Wait, that's still less than 10,000? Wait, 9999.831008 is less than 10,000, so 3184 * \u03c0 \u2248 9999.831008, so 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.831008 \u2248 0.00010000167, which is still greater than 0.0001, so x = 1/(3184\u03c0) is still within the interval. Wait, but 3184 is greater than 3183, so why did I stop at 3183? Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recast this.\n\nWait, the upper limit for n is when 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which is 1/(n\u03c0) < 1e-3. So, n\u03c0 > 1e3, so n > 1e3/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so n starts at 319.\n\nSimilarly, the lower limit is 1/(n\u03c0) > 1e-4, so n\u03c0 < 1e4, so n < 1e4/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so n can be up to 3183, because 3183 < 3183.09886184.\n\nWait, but if n = 3184, then n\u03c0 \u2248 3184 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let me compute 3184 * \u03c0 accurately:\n\n3184 * \u03c0 = (3000 + 184) * \u03c0 = 3000\u03c0 + 184\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796 + 578.0530482 \u2248 9424.77796 + 578.0530482 \u2248 9999.8310082.\n\nSo, 3184\u03c0 \u2248 9999.8310082, which is less than 10,000, so 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010000167, which is greater than 0.0001, so x = 1/(3184\u03c0) is still within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, does that mean n can go up to 3184? Wait, but 3184\u03c0 \u2248 9999.8310082, which is less than 10,000, so 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010000167, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nWait, but 3184 is greater than 3183.09886184, which was our upper limit for n. Wait, 3183.09886184 is approximately 3183.09886, so 3184 is greater than that, so n = 3184 would give x = 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010000167, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, n can go up to 3184? Wait, but 3183.09886184 is approximately 3183.09886, so the next integer is 3184, which is greater than 3183.09886, so n can be up to 3184, because 3184 < 3183.09886184? Wait, no, 3184 is greater than 3183.09886184, so n must be less than 3183.09886184, so the maximum integer n is 3183, because 3184 would be beyond that. Wait, but when n = 3184, x = 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010000167, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, does that mean that n can go up to 3184? Or is there a mistake here?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to be more precise with the calculation. Let me compute 3183.09886184 * \u03c0 to see if it's exactly 10,000. Let me compute 3183.09886184 * \u03c0.\n\nCompute 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 9999.6894156.\n\nThen, 0.09886184 * \u03c0 \u2248 0.09886184 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 0.09 * \u03c0 \u2248 0.2827433388, 0.00886184 * \u03c0 \u2248 0.0278339823. So, total \u2248 0.2827433388 + 0.0278339823 \u2248 0.3105773211.\n\nSo, total 3183.09886184 * \u03c0 \u2248 9999.6894156 + 0.3105773211 \u2248 10,000.000 exactly. So, 3183.09886184 * \u03c0 = 10,000 exactly. Therefore, 1/(3183.09886184\u03c0) = 1/10,000 = 0.0001 exactly. But our interval is x > 0.0001, so x must be greater than 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which implies n < 3183.09886184. Therefore, the maximum integer n is 3183, because 3183 < 3183.09886184, and n must be an integer. So, n can be up to 3183, because n = 3183 gives x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010000314, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed n = 3184, I got x \u2248 0.00010000167, which is still greater than 0.0001, so why can't n be 3184? Because 3184 is greater than 3183.09886184, which was the upper limit for n. So, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so the maximum integer n is 3183.\n\nWait, but 3183.09886184 is exactly where x = 0.0001, so n must be less than that to have x > 0.0001. Therefore, n can be up to 3183, as 3183 < 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, to recap, n must satisfy 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184, so n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n, meaning 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but let me think again. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely as x approaches 0, but in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a finite interval, the function will cross the x-axis each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, right? So, each x-intercept is spaced by \u0394x such that \u0394x = 1/(n\u03c0) - 1/((n+1)\u03c0) = (1/(n\u03c0)) - (1/((n+1)\u03c0)) = (n+1 - n)/(n(n+1)\u03c0) = 1/(n(n+1)\u03c0). So, the spacing between consecutive x-intercepts decreases as n increases, but in our interval, the number of intercepts is finite because the interval is bounded away from zero.\n\nWait, but I think my initial approach is correct: each x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0), and we need to find how many such x lie in (0.0001, 0.001). So, the number of intercepts is the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001). So, solving for n, we get n in (1000/\u03c0, 10000/\u03c0), which is approximately (318.309886184, 3183.09886184). Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount. Let me take a smaller example to test. Suppose I want to find the number of x-intercepts in (0.01, 0.1). Then, x = 1/(n\u03c0), so 0.01 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.1. Taking reciprocals: 10 < n\u03c0 < 100, so n in (10/\u03c0, 100/\u03c0) \u2248 (3.18309886184, 31.8309886184). So, n ranges from 4 to 31 inclusive. The number of integers is 31 - 4 + 1 = 28. Let me check: For n=4, x=1/(4\u03c0)\u22480.079577, which is less than 0.1, so included. For n=31, x=1/(31\u03c0)\u22480.010126, which is greater than 0.01, so included. So, 28 intercepts. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in our problem, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) has x-intercepts where \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\), which occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for integer \\( n \\). Thus, \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n\nTo find the x-intercepts in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we solve:\n\\[ 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\]\n\nTaking reciprocals:\n\\[ 1000 < n\\pi < 10000 \\]\n\nDividing by \\( \\pi \\) (approx. 3.1415926535):\n\\[ \\frac{1000}{\\pi} < n < \\frac{10000}{\\pi} \\]\n\\[ 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184 \\]\n\nThus, \\( n \\) ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers in this range is:\n\\[ 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 \\]\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\(\\boxed{2865}\\)."

    "text": " Let me think. Maybe it's better to invert the inequality when dealing with reciprocals. If I take reciprocals, the inequality direction reverses. So, 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0 > 1/0.001. Wait, let me check that. If a < b, then 1/a > 1/b when a and b are positive. So, starting with 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, taking reciprocals would give 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Which simplifies to 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n\u03c0 must be greater than 1000 and less than 10000. Therefore, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values. First, \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319, and the largest possible n is 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers, I can subtract the smaller from the larger and add 1. So, number of integers = 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that. 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Each of these n corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, I started by setting sin(1/x) = 0, which implies 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). Then, substituting into the interval (0.0001, 0.001), I got 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals, I correctly reversed the inequality to get 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Then, dividing by \u03c0, I found 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 = 2865. That seems correct. Hmm, but wait a second, let me think about whether n starts at 319 or 318. Since 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31, so the first integer n greater than 318.31 is 319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so the last integer n less than that is 3183. So, n runs from 319 to 3183, inclusive. So, the count is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319. Let's see, 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, yes, 2865 x-intercepts. Is there a possibility that I missed something? Maybe the endpoints? The interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. But the x-intercepts are at x = 1/(n\u03c0), which are within the open interval because 1/(n\u03c0) will be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001 for n between 319 and 3183. So, we don't include the endpoints, but since n is strictly greater than 318.31 and less than 3183.098, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, which gives us the correct count. I think that's solid. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

    "text": " Let me compute 0.0001 in terms of fractions to make it easier. 0.0001 is 1/10000. So, 1/(10000) * n\u03c0 < 1. So, n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n < 10000/\u03c0. Similarly, for the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0. So, 1 < n\u03c0 * 0.001. Let me write 0.001 as 1/1000. So, 1 < n\u03c0 / 1000. Multiplying both sides by 1000: 1000 < n\u03c0. Therefore, n > 1000/\u03c0. Now, I can compute the numerical values of 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0 to find the range of n. Let me compute 1000 divided by \u03c0. Since \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, n starts from the next integer after 318.309886184, which is 319, and goes up to the integer just below 3183.09886184, which is 3183. So, n can take integer values from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, no, actually, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, in this case, it would be 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I set sin(1/x) = 0, which gives 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). Then, I substituted into the interval 0.0001 < x < 0.001, leading to 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n, I found n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in that range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct. I don't think I made any calculation errors, but just to be sure, let me compute 3183 - 319 again: 3183 - 300 = 2883, 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865.
