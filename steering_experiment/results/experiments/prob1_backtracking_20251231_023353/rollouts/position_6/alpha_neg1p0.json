    "text": " \n\nWait, so x has to be equal to 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n. But x is in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, I can write this as 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), I can substitute that into the inequality to find the possible values of n. Let me rewrite the inequality with x expressed in terms of n:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nNow, I need to solve for n. Let me take the reciprocal of all parts of the inequality, remembering that taking reciprocals reverses the inequalities. So, if I take the reciprocal of 0.0001, that's 10000, and the reciprocal of 0.001 is 1000. But since I'm taking reciprocals, the inequality signs will flip. So:\n\n1/(0.001) > n\u03c0 > 1/(0.0001).\n\nCalculating those, 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 > n\u03c0 > 10000. Wait, that seems off because 10000 is larger than 1000. Let me correct that. When I take reciprocals, the inequality flips, so it should be:\n\n10000 > n\u03c0 > 1000.\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nNow, I can divide all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n. Let me compute 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0.\n\nFirst, 1000 divided by \u03c0. Since \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184. But n has to be an integer because it's the multiple of \u03c0 in the sine function. Therefore, n can take integer values starting from the next integer after 318.309886184, which is 319, up to the integer just below 3183.09886184, which is 3183.\n\nNow, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers, I can subtract the smaller number from the larger one and add one. So, the count is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nLet me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n that satisfy the condition. Each of these n's corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2865.\n\nWait, let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. I started by setting sin(1/x) = 0, which gives 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). Then, I substituted x into the interval and took reciprocals correctly, flipping the inequalities. Then, I solved for n, which gave me a range of n from approximately 318.31 to 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, I took the next integer above 318.31, which is 319, and the integer below 3183.098, which is 3183. Then, subtracting 319 from 3183 gives 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. That seems right.\n\nI think I might have made a mistake in the initial inequality when taking reciprocals. Let me verify that again. The original inequality is 0.0001 < x < 0.001, and x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and flipping the inequalities) gives 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. That's correct because 1/(0.001) is 1000, and 1/(0.0001) is 10000. So, yes, that part is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that as x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is very close to zero, the function sin(1/x) will oscillate a large number of times, each oscillation corresponding to a peak and a trough, and each time it crosses the x-axis, that's an x-intercept. So, the number of intercepts should be proportional to the number of periods of the sine function in that interval.\n\nEach period of sin(\u03b8) is 2\u03c0, so the number of zeros (x-intercepts) in a range from \u03b8 = a to \u03b8 = b is roughly (b - a)/\u03c0, because each half-period (\u03c0) gives one zero. Wait, actually, each full period of 2\u03c0 gives two zeros. So, perhaps the number of zeros is approximately (b - a)/(\u03c0), because between each \u03c0 interval, you get one zero. Let me check that.\n\nIf \u03b8 goes from a to b, then the number of times sin(\u03b8) crosses zero is floor(b/\u03c0) - floor(a/\u03c0). Hmm, but in our case, \u03b8 is 1/x, so as x goes from 0.0001 to 0.001, \u03b8 goes from 10000 to 1000. So, \u03b8 decreases from 10000 to 1000 as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001. So, the range of \u03b8 is from 1000 to 10000, but in reverse. Wait, actually, when x increases, 1/x decreases, so \u03b8 decreases from 10000 to 1000. So, the number of zeros would be the number of times \u03b8 crosses n\u03c0 as it decreases from 10000 to 1000.\n\nSo, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which is the same as before. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 zeros. So, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, the number of zeros can be approximated by the difference between 1/(0.001\u03c0) and 1/(0.0001\u03c0). Let me compute that:\n\nNumber of zeros \u2248 (1/(0.001\u03c0) - 1/(0.0001\u03c0)) = (1000/\u03c0 - 10000/\u03c0) = (1000 - 10000)/\u03c0 = (-9000)/\u03c0. But since we're taking absolute value, it's 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.198. Hmm, that's close to 2865, but not exactly the same. The difference is because when we take the floor function, we might lose a little bit, but in our earlier calculation, we got exactly 2865. So, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but 9000/\u03c0 is approximately 2866.198, but our exact count was 2865. So, that's very close, just off by one. That's probably because when we take the floor of 10000/\u03c0 and 1000/\u03c0, we might have lost a little bit. Let me check:\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so floor(1000/\u03c0) = 318.\n\n10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so floor(10000/\u03c0) = 3183.\n\nSo, the number of integers n from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 318 = 2865. Wait, no, that's not correct because 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865, as I had before. So, the formula using 1/(0.001\u03c0) and 1/(0.0001\u03c0) gives us an approximate value, but the exact count is 2865.\n\nSo, I think my initial calculation is correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer n. Within the interval (0.0001, 0.001), x must satisfy 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, leading to 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing by \u03c0 gives 318.31 < n < 3183.098, so n ranges from 319 to 3183, yielding 2865 integer values.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

Let me write that down: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. I can solve this inequality for n to find the range of integers n that satisfy it.\n\nFirst, let's take the reciprocals of all parts, remembering that flipping the inequalities will reverse them because reciprocating positive numbers reverses the order. So, taking reciprocals, I get:\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001.\n\nCalculating the reciprocals: 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So now I have:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nTo solve for n, I can divide all parts by \u03c0. So:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nLet me compute these values numerically. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So:\n\n1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184.\n\nSimilarly, 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nSince n has to be an integer, n must be greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184. So, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183. \n\nNow, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Let me compute that:\n\n3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nWait, is that correct? Wait, actually, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, it's 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nLet me compute 3183 - 319 first. 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2864 + 1 = 2865.\n\nSo, there are 2865 integers n such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Each of these integers corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so the next integer is 319. Then 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so the largest integer n is 3183. Then the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nWait, 3183 - 319 is indeed 2864, plus 1 is 2865. That seems correct. So, I think that's the answer: 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider the endpoints. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is an open interval, meaning it doesn't include the endpoints. So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0). Let me compute 1/(319\u03c0) to see if it's greater than 0.0001.\n\nCompute 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's see, 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477, 19\u03c0 \u2248 59.690, so total is approximately 942.477 + 59.690 \u2248 1002.167. So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.167 \u2248 0.0009978, which is approximately 0.0009978, which is just under 0.001. Wait, but 0.0009978 is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Wait, but 0.0009978 is greater than 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nSimilarly, for n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0). Let's compute 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.777, 183\u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's see, 180\u03c0 \u2248 565.486, 3\u03c0 \u2248 9.424, so total is 565.486 + 9.424 \u2248 574.910. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.777 + 574.910 \u2248 10,000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10,000 = 0.0001. But since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so x=0.0001 is excluded. So, is 1/(3183\u03c0) equal to 0.0001? Let's check: 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10,000, because \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 3183 * \u03c0 = 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute more accurately.\n\nCompute 3183 * \u03c0:\n\nFirst, 3000\u03c0 = 9424.77796077\n183\u03c0 = 183 * 3.1415926535\nCompute 180\u03c0 = 565.486677646\n3\u03c0 = 9.42477796077\nSo, 183\u03c0 = 565.486677646 + 9.42477796077 \u2248 574.911455607\nSo, total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796077 + 574.911455607 \u2248 10,000. (Wait, exactly 10,000? Let me check 3183 * \u03c0. If 3183 * \u03c0 = 10,000, then 1/(3183\u03c0) = 0.0001, but since \u03c0 is irrational, 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10,000. Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0 precisely.\n\nCompute 3183 * \u03c0:\n\nLet me use a calculator approach:\n\n3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 \n\nFirst, 3000 * 3.1415926535 = 9424.77796077\n\n183 * 3.1415926535:\n\nCompute 100 * 3.1415926535 = 314.15926535\n\n80 * 3.1415926535 = 251.32741228\n\n3 * 3.1415926535 = 9.4247779605\n\nSo, adding those: 314.15926535 + 251.32741228 = 565.48667763 + 9.4247779605 \u2248 574.91145559\n\nSo, total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796077 + 574.91145559 \u2248 10,000. So, 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10,000.00000000? Wait, that can't be because \u03c0 is irrational, so 3183\u03c0 is not exactly 10,000. Wait, but in reality, 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10,000, but slightly more or less?\n\nWait, let's compute 3183 * \u03c0 with more precision.\n\nCompute 3183 * 3.1415926535:\n\nLet me do it step by step:\n\n3183 * 3 = 9549\n\n3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 \n\nFirst, 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3\n\n3183 * 0.04 = 127.32\n\n3183 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 \n\nCompute 3183 * 0.001 = 3.183\n\n3183 * 0.0005926535 \u2248 approximately 3183 * 0.0005 = 1.5915, and 3183 * 0.0000926535 \u2248 ~0.294. So total \u2248 1.5915 + 0.294 \u2248 1.8855\n\nSo, 3183 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 3.183 + 1.8855 \u2248 5.0685\n\nNow, adding up all parts:\n\n3183 * 0.1 = 318.3\n\n3183 * 0.04 = 127.32\n\n3183 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 5.0685\n\nTotal \u2248 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.0685 \u2248 450.6885\n\nSo, total 3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 450.6885\n\nSo, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 9549 + 450.6885 \u2248 10,000. (Wait, 9549 + 450.6885 is 9999.6885, which is just under 10,000.)\n\nWait, 9549 + 450.6885 = 9999.6885, which is 0.3115 less than 10,000.\n\nSo, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.6885, which is less than 10,000. Therefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.6885 \u2248 0.0001000031.\n\nWait, that's approximately 0.0001000031, which is just over 0.0001. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so 0.0001000031 is included because it's greater than 0.0001. Wait, but that seems contradictory because 3183\u03c0 is less than 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001.\n\nWait, but if 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.6885, then 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000031, which is indeed greater than 0.0001. So, that x is included in the interval.\n\nSimilarly, for n=319, 319\u03c0 \u2248 1002.167, so 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval.\n\nWait, but when n increases, x decreases, right? So, as n increases from 319 to 3183, x decreases from approximately 0.0009978 down to approximately 0.0001000031. So, all these x values are within (0.0001, 0.001), which is the interval we're considering.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is indeed 2865.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me check the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive. The formula is b - a + 1, where a=319 and b=3183. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 gives 2865. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as starting from n=1, where x=1/\u03c0, and as n increases, x decreases. So, each n corresponds to a unique x in the interval. Therefore, the count should be correct.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 2865 x-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for each integer n. To find how many such x lie in (0.0001, 0.001), we solve 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, leading to 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. The number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive is 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

But x is equal to 1/(n\u03c0), so substituting that in, I get 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. I can solve this inequality for n to find the range of integers n that satisfy this condition.\n\nLet me rewrite the inequalities:\n\nFirst, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that taking reciprocals reverses the inequality, I get 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Calculating 1/0.0001 gives me 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, which is approximately 3.14159, I get n < 10000 / \u03c0. Let me compute that: 10000 divided by 3.14159 is approximately 3183.09886. So n must be less than approximately 3183.09886.\n\nNext, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0. 1/0.001 is 1000, so 1000 < n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, I get n > 1000 / \u03c0. Calculating that, 1000 divided by 3.14159 is approximately 318.309886. So n must be greater than approximately 318.309886.\n\nSince n has to be an integer, n must satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Now, I need to count how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is given by b - a + 1. So, plugging in the values, it would be 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives me 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n that satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 3183.09886, so n must be less than that. Since n has to be an integer, the largest n can be is 3183. Similarly, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 318.309886, so the smallest integer n can be is 319. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me think about this another way to confirm. The x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for each integer n. So, for each n, we get a distinct x-intercept as long as x is within our interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, the number of such x-intercepts should correspond to the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001). Which is exactly what I calculated. So, that seems consistent.\n\nIs there any chance I might have missed something? Let me check the endpoints. The interval is open, so x = 0.0001 and x = 0.001 are not included. But since x = 1/(n\u03c0), when n is 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but since it's open, we don't include it. Similarly, when n is 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000) = 0.001, which is the upper bound, but again, it's open, so we don't include that either. Therefore, the x-intercepts are strictly between 0.0001 and 0.001, so n must be strictly greater than 318.309886 and strictly less than 3183.09886. Therefore, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, which are both integers, so that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the function y = sin(1/x) oscillates more and more frequently as x approaches 0. In the interval from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is from 10^{-4} to 10^{-3}, the function is oscillating very rapidly. Each time x passes through a value 1/(n\u03c0), it crosses the x-axis. So, the number of crossings is the number of n's such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in that interval. So, again, n must be between 319 and 3183, inclusive. So, the count is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, let me just compute 3183 minus 319 again. 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then minus 19 more is 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865. Yep, that's correct.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. I considered the function, set it equal to zero, found the condition on n, computed the range for n, and then counted the integers in that range. I also checked the endpoints to make sure I wasn't including them when I shouldn't. So, I'm confident that the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Solving for n gives 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

So, I need to find all integers n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me write that down: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. I can rewrite these inequalities to solve for n. Starting with the left inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Taking reciprocals on both sides (and remembering that flipping inequalities when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive), we get: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Calculating 1/0.0001: that's 10000. So, 10000 > n\u03c0, which means n < 10000/\u03c0. Similarly, the right inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals again: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Now, let me compute these values numerically to find the range of n. First, 10000 divided by \u03c0. Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n is an integer, the maximum integer n can be is 3183. Now, the lower bound: 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618. Since n is an integer, the smallest integer n can be is 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range, inclusive. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, it's 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me calculate that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then +1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in that interval. Wait, let me double-check that I didn't make a mistake in the number of terms. The formula is (last - first) + 1. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 is 2865. Yeah, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of it as starting at n=319 and ending at n=3183, so the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1.

    "text": " So, each x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n.\n\nNow, the interval I'm looking at is (0.0001, 0.001). I need to find all x in this interval such that x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, I can set up inequalities to find the range of n that satisfies 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nI can solve for n here. Let's first find the lower bound:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0)\n\nMultiplying both sides by n\u03c0 (since n and \u03c0 are positive, the inequality direction doesn't change):\n\n0.0001 * n\u03c0 < 1\n\nDividing both sides by 0.0001:\n\nn\u03c0 < 1 / 0.0001\nn\u03c0 < 10000\n\nSo, n < 10000 / \u03c0\n\nCalculating that, \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618\n\nSince n has to be an integer, n \u2264 3183.\n\nNow, let's find the upper bound:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nAgain, multiplying both sides by n\u03c0:\n\n1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0\n\nDividing both sides by 0.001:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0\n\nSo, n > 1000 / \u03c0\n\nCalculating that, 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618\n\nSince n has to be an integer, n \u2265 319.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive.\n\nNow, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add 1 (since both endpoints are included).\n\nSo, number of intercepts = 3183 - 319 + 1\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\n2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, 3183 - 319: Let's compute 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. So, yes, 2864, then add 1 gives 2865.\n\nHmm, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because each n corresponds to a unique x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, each integer n between 319 and 3183 gives a distinct x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, the number of x-intercepts should be equal to the number of integers n in that range.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm the initial setup. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001). So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001.\n\nSo, 0.0001 < x < 0.001\n\nBut x = 1/(n\u03c0), so substituting:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nTherefore, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nWhich, as I calculated earlier, is approximately 318.30988618 < n < 3183.0988618\n\nSince n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the subtraction.\n\nLet me compute 3183 - 319:\n\n3183 - 300 = 2883\n\n2883 - 19 = 2864\n\nYes, so 2864, then adding 1 gives 2865.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nBut wait, let me think about this again. Because as x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a finite interval, how many zeros does it have?\n\nWait, but according to the calculation, it's 2865, which is a finite number. That makes sense because the interval is finite, so even though sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely as x approaches 0, in this specific interval, it's a finite number of oscillations.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, the function sin(1/x) is sin(\u03b8) where \u03b8 goes from 1000\u03c0 to 10000\u03c0.\n\nNow, sin(\u03b8) has a period of 2\u03c0, so between \u03b8 = 1000\u03c0 and \u03b8 = 10000\u03c0, how many zeros are there?\n\nEach zero occurs at \u03b8 = n\u03c0, so between 1000\u03c0 and 10000\u03c0, the number of zeros would be the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 in that interval.\n\nSo, the smallest n where n\u03c0 > 1000\u03c0 is n = 1001, because 1000\u03c0 is the lower bound, so n starts at 1001.\n\nWait, no, because \u03b8 starts at 1000\u03c0, so the next zero after \u03b8 = 1000\u03c0 would be at \u03b8 = 1001\u03c0, which is greater than 1000\u03c0.\n\nSimilarly, the last zero before \u03b8 = 10000\u03c0 is at \u03b8 = 10000\u03c0, but since \u03b8 approaches 10000\u03c0 from below, the largest n is 10000, but \u03b8 = 10000\u03c0 is the upper limit, which is excluded because x is less than 0.001, so \u03b8 is less than 10000\u03c0. So, the largest n is 9999, because \u03b8 = 9999\u03c0 is less than 10000\u03c0.\n\nWait, this seems conflicting with my earlier approach. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, earlier, I set x = 1/(n\u03c0), so n = 1/(x\u03c0). So, when x is in (0.0001, 0.001), then n ranges from 319 to 3183. So, the number of n's is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nBut now, if I think of \u03b8 = 1/x, which ranges from 1000 to 10000. So, \u03b8 ranges from 1000 to 10000. The zeros of sin(\u03b8) occur at \u03b8 = k\u03c0, where k is an integer. So, the number of zeros in \u03b8 \u2208 (1000, 10000) is equal to the number of integers k such that 1000 < k\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nWhich is the same as k \u2208 (1000/\u03c0, 10000/\u03c0), which is approximately (318.31, 3183.098). So, k starts at 319 and ends at 3183, same as before. So, the number of zeros is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that between \u03b8 = a and \u03b8 = b, the number of zeros of sin(\u03b8) is floor(b/\u03c0) - ceil(a/\u03c0) + 1, if I'm not mistaken.\n\nWait, let's test that formula.\n\nIf \u03b8 ranges from a to b, then the number of zeros is the number of integers k such that k\u03c0 is in (a, b). So, k must satisfy a < k\u03c0 < b, which is equivalent to a/\u03c0 < k < b/\u03c0.\n\nSo, the number of integers k is floor(b/\u03c0) - ceil(a/\u03c0) + 1.\n\nIn our case, a = 1000, b = 10000.\n\nSo, ceil(1000/\u03c0) = ceil(318.30988618) = 319\n\nfloor(10000/\u03c0) = floor(3183.0988618) = 3183\n\nSo, number of zeros is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865, same as before.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you count inclusive ranges, you have to be careful whether the endpoints are included or not. But in this case, since the interval for x is open, (0.0001, 0.001), so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. Therefore, \u03b8 = 1/x cannot be exactly 10000 or 1000. So, the zeros occur at \u03b8 = k\u03c0 where k is from 319 to 3183, but \u03b8 = 319\u03c0 must be greater than 1000, and \u03b8 = 3183\u03c0 must be less than 10000.\n\nWait, let me check if 319\u03c0 is greater than 1000.\n\n319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let me compute 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477, 19\u03c0 \u2248 59.690, so total \u2248 942.477 + 59.690 \u2248 1002.167, which is greater than 1000. So, yes, 319\u03c0 > 1000.\n\nSimilarly, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.777, 183\u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 180\u03c0 \u2248 565.486, 3\u03c0 \u2248 9.42477, so total \u2248 565.486 + 9.42477 \u2248 574.910. So, 3000\u03c0 + 183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.777 + 574.910 \u2248 9999.687, which is less than 10000. So, yes, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.687 < 10000.\n\nTherefore, the number of zeros is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to see if my formula is correct.\n\nSuppose I have \u03b8 from 2\u03c0 to 4\u03c0. Then, the zeros of sin(\u03b8) occur at \u03b8 = 2\u03c0, 3\u03c0, 4\u03c0, etc., but in the interval (2\u03c0, 4\u03c0), the zeros are at 3\u03c0 only. So, number of zeros is 1.\n\nUsing the formula: ceil(2\u03c0/\u03c0) = ceil(2) = 2, floor(4\u03c0/\u03c0) = floor(4) = 4. So, number of zeros = 4 - 2 + 1 = 3. But in reality, there's only one zero in (2\u03c0, 4\u03c0), which is at 3\u03c0. So, the formula gives 3, but correct answer is 1. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, so my formula might be incorrect. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the example, \u03b8 \u2208 (2\u03c0, 4\u03c0). The zeros occur at \u03b8 = 3\u03c0, which is one zero. But according to the formula, ceil(2\u03c0/\u03c0) = 2, floor(4\u03c0/\u03c0) = 4, so 4 - 2 + 1 = 3. That's not correct. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula should be floor(b/\u03c0) - ceil(a/\u03c0). Let's try that.\n\nIn the example, floor(4\u03c0/\u03c0) = 4, ceil(2\u03c0/\u03c0) = 2, so 4 - 2 = 2, but the actual number is 1. Hmm, still not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is floor(b/\u03c0) - ceil(a/\u03c0) + 1, but in the example, that would be 4 - 2 + 1 = 3, which is still wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think.\n\nThe number of zeros of sin(\u03b8) in (a, b) is equal to the number of integers k such that k\u03c0 \u2208 (a, b). So, k must satisfy a < k\u03c0 < b, which is equivalent to a/\u03c0 < k < b/\u03c0.\n\nSo, the number of integers k is floor(b/\u03c0 - 1) - ceil(a/\u03c0) + 1. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute it as the number of integers between a/\u03c0 and b/\u03c0.\n\nSo, if a = 2\u03c0, b = 4\u03c0, then a/\u03c0 = 2, b/\u03c0 = 4.\n\nThe integers k such that 2 < k < 4 are k=3, which is one integer. So, the number of zeros is 1.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, a = 1000, b = 10000, so a/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, b/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618.\n\nThe number of integers k such that 318.30988618 < k < 3183.0988618 is floor(3183.0988618) - ceil(318.30988618) = 3183 - 319 = 2864. But wait, that's not including both endpoints. Wait, but in the example, when a=2\u03c0, b=4\u03c0, a/\u03c0=2, b/\u03c0=4, so the number of integers k with 2 < k <4 is 1 (k=3). So, the formula would be floor(b/\u03c0) - ceil(a/\u03c0). So, 4 - 2 = 2, but the actual number is 1. Hmm, that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is floor(b/\u03c0) - ceil(a/\u03c0). In the example, floor(4\u03c0/\u03c0)=4, ceil(2\u03c0/\u03c0)=2, so 4 - 2 = 2, but actual number is 1. So, that's incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is floor((b - \u03b5)/\u03c0) - ceil((a + \u03b5)/\u03c0) + 1, where \u03b5 is a small positive number to account for open intervals. But that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of zeros is equal to the number of times the sine function crosses zero between \u03b8 = a and \u03b8 = b, which is equal to the number of half-periods in that interval, but that might not be precise.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to realize that between \u03b8 = a and \u03b8 = b, the number of zeros is equal to the number of times \u03b8 crosses a multiple of \u03c0. So, the number of such crossings is the number of integers k where a < k\u03c0 < b. So, the number of k's is floor(b/\u03c0) - ceil(a/\u03c0) + 1 if a/\u03c0 is not an integer, but in our case, a=1000 and b=10000, neither of which are multiples of \u03c0, so it's safe.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, a=2\u03c0, b=4\u03c0, which are both multiples of \u03c0. So, the number of zeros in (2\u03c0, 4\u03c0) is the number of k where 2\u03c0 < k\u03c0 < 4\u03c0, which is k=3, so only one zero at 3\u03c0.\n\nBut according to the formula floor(b/\u03c0) - ceil(a/\u03c0) +1, when a=2\u03c0, b=4\u03c0:\n\nfloor(4\u03c0/\u03c0) =4, ceil(2\u03c0/\u03c0)=2, so 4 - 2 +1=3, which is wrong.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct formula is floor(b/\u03c0) - ceil(a/\u03c0). So, in the example, 4 -2=2, but actual is 1. Hmm, still not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is floor((b - \u03b5)/\u03c0) - ceil((a + \u03b5)/\u03c0) +1, but that might be overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of zeros is the integer part of (b/\u03c0) minus the integer part of (a/\u03c0). But in the example, 4/\u03c0 \u22481.273, but that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think differently.\n\nIn the interval \u03b8 \u2208 (a, b), the number of zeros is the number of integer solutions k to a < k\u03c0 < b. So, k must satisfy a/\u03c0 < k < b/\u03c0. The number of integers k in that interval is floor(b/\u03c0 - 1) - ceil(a/\u03c0) +1? Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute it as the number of integers k such that k > a/\u03c0 and k < b/\u03c0. So, the smallest integer k satisfying k > a/\u03c0 is ceil(a/\u03c0) +1? Wait, no.\n\nWait, if a/\u03c0 is not an integer, then the smallest integer greater than a/\u03c0 is floor(a/\u03c0) +1. Similarly, the largest integer less than b/\u03c0 is floor(b/\u03c0).\n\nSo, the number of integers k is floor(b/\u03c0) - (floor(a/\u03c0) +1) +1 = floor(b/\u03c0) - floor(a/\u03c0) -1 +1 = floor(b/\u03c0) - floor(a/\u03c0).\n\nWait, in the example where a=2\u03c0, b=4\u03c0:\n\nfloor(b/\u03c0) = floor(4) =4, floor(a/\u03c0)=floor(2)=2, so number of zeros=4-2=2, but actual is 1. Hmm, still not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps this approach is not correct. Maybe I should instead consider that between \u03b8=a and \u03b8=b, the number of zeros is floor((b - a)/(\u03c0)) + something. Wait, that might not work either.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula that the number of zeros of sin(\u03b8) in (a, b) is equal to the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 in that interval, which is the same as the number of integers k such that a < k\u03c0 < b. So, the number of such k is floor(b/\u03c0) - ceil(a/\u03c0) +1 if a/\u03c0 is not an integer. Wait, let's test that.\n\nIn the example, a=2\u03c0, b=4\u03c0:\n\nceil(a/\u03c0)=ceil(2)=2, floor(b/\u03c0)=floor(4)=4, so 4 -2 +1=3, which is incorrect because only k=3 is in (2\u03c0,4\u03c0).\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is floor(b/\u03c0) - ceil(a/\u03c0). So, 4 -2=2, but actual is 1.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is floor((b - \u03b5)/\u03c0) - ceil((a + \u03b5)/\u03c0), where \u03b5 is a small positive number. So, in the example, floor((4\u03c0 - \u03b5)/\u03c0)=3, ceil((2\u03c0 + \u03b5)/\u03c0)=3, so 3 -3=0, which is also incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Maybe it's better to think that in the interval (a, b), the number of zeros is the number of times \u03b8 crosses a multiple of \u03c0, which is the number of integers k where a < k\u03c0 < b. So, the number of such k is equal to the number of integers between a/\u03c0 and b/\u03c0.\n\nSo, the number of integers between a/\u03c0 and b/\u03c0 is equal to floor(b/\u03c0) - ceil(a/\u03c0) +1 if a/\u03c0 is not an integer and b/\u03c0 is not an integer.\n\nWait, in the example, a=2\u03c0, b=4\u03c0, a/\u03c0=2, b/\u03c0=4.\n\nSo, the number of integers between 2 and 4 is 3 (2,3,4), but since the interval is open, (2,4), we exclude 2 and 4, so only 3 is included, which is 1 integer.\n\nSo, the formula would be floor(b/\u03c0) - ceil(a/\u03c0). Because ceil(2)=2, floor(4)=4, so 4 -2=2, but actual is 1. Hmm, still not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is floor(b/\u03c0 - 1) - ceil(a/\u03c0) +1. Let's test that.\n\nIn the example, floor(4\u03c0/\u03c0 -1)=floor(4 -1)=3, ceil(2\u03c0/\u03c0)=2, so 3 -2 +1=2, which is still incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach.\n\nIn the original problem, \u03b8 ranges from 1000 to 10000. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers k such that 1000 < k\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nWhich is equivalent to k > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248318.30988618 and k < 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.0988618.\n\nSo, k must be integers from 319 to 3183, inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1=2865.\n\nIn the example, a=2\u03c0\u22486.283185307, b=4\u03c0\u224812.56637061.\n\nSo, k must satisfy 6.283185307 <k\u03c0<12.56637061.\n\nWhich is k>6.283185307/\u03c0\u22482, and k<12.56637061/\u03c0\u22484.\n\nSo, k must be integers 3.\n\nThus, number of zeros is 1.\n\nSo, in this case, k ranges from 3 to3, so number of integers is1.\n\nSo, in this case, the formula works as 3 -3 +1=1.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the lower bound was 319 and upper 3183, so 3183 -319 +1=2865.\n\nSimilarly, in the example, lower bound is 3, upper is3, so 3 -3 +1=1.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nWait, so in the example, the number of zeros is 1, which matches.\n\nSo, perhaps the formula is correct.\n\nSo, in the original problem, the number of zeros is 2865.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the initial step where I set x=1/(n\u03c0). Since x is in (0.0001, 0.001), then n must satisfy 1000 <n\u03c0<10000, which gives n from 319 to 3183, inclusive, so 2865 integers.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). For x in (0.0001, 0.001), we find n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. This gives n from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

    "text": " \n\nWait, so x is equal to 1 divided by (n times pi). That makes sense. So, every time x is of the form 1/(n\u03c0), the function will cross the x-axis. Now, I need to find all such x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, let me write down the inequalities: 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), I can substitute that into the inequalities. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nNow, I can solve these inequalities for n. Let me start with the left inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that flipping inequalities when taking reciprocals reverses them, so I get 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Calculating 1/0.0001 is 10,000, so 10,000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, I get n < 10,000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10,000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10,000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n is an integer, n \u2264 3183.\n\nNow, let's look at the right inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, which reverses the inequality, so n\u03c0 > 1/0.001. 1/0.001 is 1000, so n\u03c0 > 1000. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Since n must be an integer, n \u2265 319.\n\nSo, putting it together, n must be an integer such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Now, I need to count how many integers are in this range. To find the number of integers from a to b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, plugging in, it's 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me check the calculations again. 10,000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 3183.0988, so the maximum integer n is 3183. 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 318.3099, so the minimum integer n is 319. So, the integers n start at 319 and go up to 3183. The number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more, so 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Let me just think if there's any chance I missed something. For example, does n start at 1 or 0? Well, n has to be a positive integer because x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which are positive, so n must be positive. So, n starts at 319, which is correct. Also, since 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001, the maximum n is 3183, as we found. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the exact values to make sure that n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0) which is approximately 1/(1002.94) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so that's okay. And n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.01) \u2248 0.000099999, which is just above 0.0001, so that's included. So, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive are valid. So, the count is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. We need to find how many such x lie between 0.0001 and 0.001.\n\n1. Set up the inequalities: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n2.

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so every x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n. Now, I need to find all such x that lie within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, I should find all integers n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me write that down:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nHmm, okay, so I can solve for n here. Let me first flip the inequalities because when I take reciprocals, the inequalities reverse. So, if I take reciprocals of all parts, remembering that all terms are positive, I get:\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nCalculating those reciprocals:\n\n1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000.\n\nSo now I have:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nTo solve for n, I can divide all parts by \u03c0. Let me compute that:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nCalculating 1000/\u03c0: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 1000/3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184\n\nSimilarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000/3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, n must satisfy:\n\n318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184\n\nSince n has to be an integer, n can take integer values starting from the next integer after 318.309886184, which is 319, up to the integer before 3183.09886184, which is 3183.\n\nNow, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then add 1 (since both endpoints are inclusive). Wait, actually, it's from 319 to 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\n2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute the number of integers between a and b inclusive as b - a + 1. So, if a is 319 and b is 3183, then the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating 3183 - 319:\n\n3183 - 300 = 2883\n\n2883 - 19 = 2864\n\nThen 2864 + 1 = 2865.\n\nHmm, so that suggests there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait a second, but I need to make sure that each of these n corresponds to an x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Let me check for n=319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.38) \u2248 0.0009966, which is approximately 0.001, but since 0.0009966 is less than 0.001, it's within the interval. Similarly, for n=3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10003.38) \u2248 0.000099966, which is approximately 0.0001, but just slightly less, so it's within the interval as well.\n\nWait, but 0.0001 is 10^{-4}, and 0.001 is 10^{-3}. So, the x-intercepts are at x = 1/(n\u03c0), so as n increases, x decreases. So, the smallest n is 319, giving x \u2248 0.0009966, which is just below 0.001, and the largest n is 3183, giving x \u2248 0.000099966, which is just above 0.0001. So, all these x's lie within (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of intercepts is indeed 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when I take n from 319 to 3183, inclusive, how many terms is that? Let me compute 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's see: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and 2864 + 1 is 2865. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it as the floor of 10000/\u03c0 minus the ceiling of 1000/\u03c0, and then add 1. Let me check:\n\n10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so floor of that is 3183.\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so ceiling is 319.\n\nSo, number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial step. So, x has to be in (0.0001, 0.001). So, 0.0001 < x < 0.001.\n\nBut x = 1/(n\u03c0), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nWhich implies 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nDivide by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nSo, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so the smallest integer n is 319.\n\nSimilarly, n must be less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so the largest integer n is 3183.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Hmm, but 2865 seems like a lot of intercepts. Let me think about how the function behaves.\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) oscillates more and more frequently as x approaches 0. So, as x approaches 0 from the positive side, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates between -1 and 1 infinitely many times. But in our interval, we're looking between x = 0.0001 and x = 0.001, which is a pretty small interval near zero, so the function is oscillating very rapidly there.\n\nBut how many zeros are there between x = 0.0001 and x = 0.001? Each zero occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0), so the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is between 0.0001 and 0.001.\n\nWhich is exactly what we computed: n from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 zeros.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, the sine function sin(1/x) will go through a complete cycle every 2\u03c0 interval in 1/x. So, the number of zeros should be approximately the number of times 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0 in that interval.\n\nSo, the number of zeros is roughly the number of n where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0), and x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, so n is between 319 and 3183, as we found.\n\nSo, the number of zeros is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check with n=319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.38) \u2248 0.0009966, which is just below 0.001, so that's included. Similarly, n=3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10003.38) \u2248 0.000099966, which is just above 0.0001, so that's included as well.\n\nTherefore, the count is correct.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the calculation of 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 minus 319:\n\n3183 - 300 is 2883.\n\n2883 - 19 is 2864.\n\nThen, 2864 + 1 is 2865.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think that's the answer. There are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we start by noting that the x-intercepts occur where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\). This happens when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for some integer \\( n \\), which implies \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n\nWe need to find the integers \\( n \\) such that \\( 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\). Taking reciprocals and dividing by \\( \\pi \\), we get:\n\n\\[\n1000 < n\\pi < 10000\n\\]\n\nDividing by \\( \\pi \\approx 3.1415926535 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1000}{\\pi} \\approx 318.309886184 < n < \\frac{10000}{\\pi} \\approx 3183.09886184\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( n \\) must be an integer between 319 and 3183 inclusive. The number of such integers is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is \\(\\boxed{2865}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nWait, so each x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0), where n is a positive integer because x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a very small positive number. So, I need to find all integers n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me write that down:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nI can rewrite this inequality to solve for n. Let's take the reciprocals, remembering that flipping the inequality signs when taking reciprocals because all terms are positive. So, flipping the inequalities:\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nCalculating those values:\n\n1/0.001 = 1000\n\n1/0.0001 = 10000\n\nSo, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nNow, divide all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nCalculating these values:\n\n\u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so:\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184\n\n10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, n must be an integer such that 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184\n\nSince n has to be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319 and the largest possible n is 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are between 319 and 3183 inclusive.\n\nTo find the number of integers from a to b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, let's apply that:\n\nNumber of integers = 3183 - 319 + 1\n\nCalculating that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\n2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nSo, there are 2865 integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. So, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 minus 319. 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more, which is 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the number of integers from 1 to 3183 minus the number of integers from 1 to 318. So, 3183 - 318 = 2865. Hmm, wait, that's not quite right because 3183 - 318 would be 2865, but since we're starting at 319, which is 318 + 1, maybe that's another way to see it. Either way, it seems consistent.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial step, let me verify the inequality again. The x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0). We want x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals, as I did before, gives 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so n must be between approximately 318.31 and 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, which gives 2865 integers. That seems right.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts at x = 1/(n\u03c0) where n is an integer. To find the number of such x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), we solve for n:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001  \n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000  \n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.10\n\nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

    "text": " \n\nNow, I need to find all x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) such that x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, I can set up inequalities to find the range of n that satisfies 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me write that down:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nTo solve for n, I can take reciprocals on all parts, remembering that flipping the inequalities when taking reciprocals (since all terms are positive):\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nCalculating those reciprocals:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nNow, divide all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nLet me compute these values. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so:\n\n1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184\n10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSince n has to be an integer, I need to find all integers n such that 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. \n\nTo find the number of integers between two numbers, I can subtract the smaller number from the larger one and add one. So, the count is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nWait, that seems like a lot of intercepts. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, I started with 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Then I took reciprocals correctly, remembering that flipping the inequality when taking reciprocals because all terms are positive. So, 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000 is correct.\n\nDividing by \u03c0 gives me 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n has to be greater than approximately 318.31, so the next integer is 319, and less than approximately 3183.098, so the last integer is 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 2865 integer values of n, each corresponding to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait a second, but I just thought about it, the interval is (0.0001, 0.001). So, does that include the endpoints? The problem says \"in the interval (0.0001, 0.001)\", which is an open interval, so it doesn't include the endpoints. Therefore, x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001, but since the x-intercepts are at x = 1/(n\u03c0), and 1/(n\u03c0) is between 0.0001 and 0.001, I think we're okay because 1/(n\u03c0) will never be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001 unless n is exactly 10000/\u03c0 or 1000/\u03c0, which are not integers because \u03c0 is irrational. So, all the x-intercepts are strictly inside the interval, so the count remains 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check if n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0) which is approximately 1/(319*3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(1002.30) \u2248 0.0009976, which is just below 0.001, so it's inside the interval. Similarly, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.00) \u2248 0.0001, but since the interval is open, does 0.0001 get included? Wait, no, because the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but is it greater than 0.0001?\n\nWait, let's compute 1/(3183\u03c0). Let's compute 3183 * \u03c0:\n\n3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute that:\n\n3183 * 3 = 9549\n3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.14 \u2248 445.62, and 3183 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 ~5.06, so total \u2248 445.62 + 5.06 \u2248 450.68. So total \u03c0*3183 \u2248 9549 + 450.68 \u2248 10,000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10,000, because \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 10,000.000000... something. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001, right? Because if 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10,000, then 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001. So, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, which is outside the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included in the interval. So, the maximum n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is when n is the largest integer less than 10000/\u03c0, which is 3183, but since 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10,000, 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the largest n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3182. Let me check that.\n\nCompute 1/(3182\u03c0). Since 3182\u03c0 is slightly less than 10,000, because 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10,000, so 3182\u03c0 \u2248 10,000 - \u03c0 \u2248 10,000 - 3.1415926535 \u2248 9996.8584. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.8584 \u2248 0.00010003, which is just above 0.0001. So, x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010003, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nSimilarly, let's check n=319. 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.30) \u2248 0.0009976, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nNow, let's compute the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive. That's 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that:\n\n3182 - 319 = 2863\n2863 + 1 = 2864\n\nWait, that's different from before. So, previously, I thought n went up to 3183, but actually, it's 3182 because 3183\u03c0 is just over 10,000, making x=1/(3183\u03c0) just under 0.0001, which is excluded. So, the correct upper bound for n is 3182, making the number of intercepts 2864.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this. Let me compute 3182\u03c0:\n\n3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3000\u03c0 = 9424.77796, 182\u03c0 \u2248 182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 571.238898. So, total \u2248 9424.77796 + 571.238898 \u2248 10,000.016858. Wait, that can't be right because 3182\u03c0 should be less than 10,000. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 3182 * \u03c0 more accurately.\n\nWait, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 10,000.000000 something, as per the initial calculation, because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000. So, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 3183\u03c0 - \u03c0 \u2248 10,000 - \u03c0 \u2248 10,000 - 3.1415926535 \u2248 9996.8584. Therefore, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.8584 \u2248 0.00010003, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. So, n=3182 is acceptable, but n=3183 is not because x=1/(3183\u03c0) is just under 0.0001.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 3182 - 319 = 2863; 2863 +1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, which is correct? Let me check again.\n\nWait, when n starts at 319 and ends at 3182, the number of terms is (3182 - 319) + 1. So, 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the initial step where I took reciprocals. So, starting from 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, taking reciprocals correctly (since all terms are positive), we get 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which is correct. Then, dividing by \u03c0, we get 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184, so the smallest integer n is 319. And n must be less than approximately 3183.09886184, so the largest integer n is 3183. But as we saw, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but it's less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the largest n is 3182, which gives x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010003, which is just over 0.0001, so included.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with specific examples to ensure I haven't missed anything. Let's take n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009976, which is between 0.0001 and 0.001, so included. n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010003, which is just over 0.0001, so included. n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009997, which is just under 0.0001, so excluded. So, yes, n goes up to 3182.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but after considering the upper bound, it's 2864. So, which is correct?\n\nLet me compute 3182 - 319 + 1:\n\n3182 - 319 = 2863\n2863 + 1 = 2864\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The number of integers between a and b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, if a=319 and b=3182, then 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is the number of integers between 319 and 3182 is the same as the number of integers less than or equal to 3182 minus the number less than 319. So, floor(3182) - floor(318.309886184) = 3182 - 318 = 2864. That also gives the same result.\n\nYes, so I think 2864 is the correct number of x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider a smaller interval to test the method. Suppose I wanted to find the number of x-intercepts between x=0.0002 and x=0.0003. Then, 0.0002 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.0003. Taking reciprocals, 1/0.0003 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0002, which is 3333.333... < n\u03c0 < 5000. So, n must be between 3333.333.../\u03c0 \u2248 1061.0329 and 5000/\u03c0 \u2248 1591.5494. So, n ranges from 1062 to 1591 inclusive. The number of integers is 1591 - 1062 + 1 = 530. Let me check with n=1062: x=1/(1062\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3335.103) \u2248 0.0002998, which is just under 0.0003, so it's included. Wait, no, 0.0002998 is less than 0.0003, so it's included. Wait, but 0.0002998 is greater than 0.0002, so it's included. Similarly, n=1591: x=1/(1591\u03c0) \u2248 1/(5000.00) \u2248 0.0002, which is the lower bound, but since the interval is (0.0002, 0.0003), it's open, so x=0.0002 is excluded. Therefore, n=1591 gives x=1/(1591\u03c0) \u2248 0.0002, which is excluded. So, the maximum n is 1590, which gives x=1/(1590\u03c0) \u2248 0.0002001, which is just over 0.0002, so included. Therefore, n ranges from 1062 to 1590 inclusive, which is 1590 - 1062 + 1 = 529. Wait, but according to the earlier calculation, it was 530. Hmm, so perhaps my initial method was slightly off.\n\nWait, but in this smaller example, the number of intercepts is 529, but according to the formula, it's 1590 - 1062 +1 = 529. So, that's correct. So, in that case, the formula works. So, in the original problem, using the same method, it's 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864. So, I think that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me recompute 3182 - 319 +1:\n\n3182 - 319 = 2863\n2863 +1 = 2864\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3182 - 319:\n\n3182 - 300 = 2882\n2882 - 19 = 2863\nSo, 3182 - 319 = 2863\n2863 +1 = 2864\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think I've carefully checked each step, and the conclusion is that there are 2864 x-intercepts in the given interval.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

Let me write that down: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. \n\nTo find the values of n that satisfy this inequality, I can solve for n. Let's take the reciprocal of all parts, remembering to reverse the inequalities when taking reciprocals because all terms are positive. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those, 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. \n\nNow, divide all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. \n\nSince n must be an integer, n ranges from the smallest integer greater than 318.309886184 to the largest integer less than 3183.09886184. The smallest integer greater than 318.309886184 is 319, and the largest integer less than 3183.09886184 is 3183. \n\nSo, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range, inclusive. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is given by b - a + 1. So, plugging in the values: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, and then plus 1 is 2865. \n\nWait, let me check that again. 3183 minus 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more, so 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n that satisfy the condition. \n\nBut hold on, I should double-check if both endpoints are included correctly. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the count is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319 first. 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then minus 19 is 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, yes, that seems correct. \n\nTherefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial setup. The function is sin(1/x), so x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which is when 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). Then, I set 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so n is between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which gives the integer range from 319 to 3183. Counting these integers gives 2865. That seems consistent. \n\nI think that's the correct number of x-intercepts. So, the final answer should be 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) has x-intercepts where \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\), which occurs at \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\) for integer \\( n \\).

Since \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, let's calculate:\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184\n10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, n must be an integer strictly greater than approximately 318.309886184 and strictly less than approximately 3183.09886184. Therefore, n can take integer values from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1, but since our range is from 319 to 3183, and both endpoints are integers, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, if I have numbers from m to n inclusive, the count is n - m + 1. So here, m is 319 and n is 3183. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nSo, there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in that interval.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. So, 10000/\u03c0 is approximately 3183.098, so the largest integer n is 3183. Similarly, 1000/\u03c0 is approximately 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319:\n\n3183 - 300 = 2883\n2883 - 19 = 2864\n\nThen, 2864 + 1 = 2865. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Each n corresponds to a unique x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, each n gives a distinct x in the interval. Since n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, that's 2865 values of n, so 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nIs there any chance I might have made a mistake in setting up the inequality? Let me check:\n\nWe have x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), substituting, we get 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals, as I did, reverses the inequalities because all terms are positive. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Then, dividing by \u03c0 gives 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.309886 < n < 3183.098862. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 2865 integers.\n\nWait, but let me think about whether the endpoints are included. The interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. So, when I took 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, that's correct because x has to be strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. So, n must satisfy n > 1000/\u03c0 and n < 10000/\u03c0, but since n must be an integer, the smallest n is 319 because 318 would give x = 1/(318\u03c0) which is approximately 1/(1000.09) \u2248 0.0009999, which is greater than 0.001? Wait, hold on, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, no, wait, x = 1/(n\u03c0). If n = 318, then x = 1/(318\u03c0). Let me compute 318\u03c0. 318 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 318 * 3.1416 \u2248 318 * 3 = 954, 318 * 0.1416 \u2248 45. So, total \u2248 954 + 45 = 999. So, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/999 \u2248 0.001001, which is just over 0.001. But our interval is up to 0.001, exclusive. So, x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.001001 is just outside the upper bound of 0.001. Therefore, n must be greater than 318.309886, so the smallest integer n is 319. Similarly, n = 3183 gives x = 1/(3183\u03c0). Let's compute 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.1416 \u2248 450, so total \u2248 9549 + 450 \u2248 10,000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10,000 = 0.0001. But our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001. So, n must be less than 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 3183.098862. So, the largest integer n is 3183, which gives x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since our interval is open at 0.0001, we need to check if x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001.\n\nWait, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10,000) = 0.0001 exactly? Wait, no, because 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since 3183 * \u03c0 is slightly more than 10,000, because \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute that more accurately.\n\n3183 * 3 = 9549\n3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3\n3183 * 0.0415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32\n3183 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 Approximately 3183 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0928\n\nSo adding those up: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.0928 \u2248 450.7128\n\nSo total 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 9549 + 450.7128 \u2248 9999.7128, which is just under 10,000. Therefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.7128 \u2248 0.0001000028, which is just over 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000028, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n can be 3183.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.001001, which is just over 0.001, so n=318 is excluded because x must be less than 0.001. So, n starts at 319.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me make sure about the lower bound. For n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0). Let me compute 319\u03c0:\n\n319 * 3 = 957\n319 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 319 * 0.1 = 31.9\n319 * 0.0415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 319 * 0.04 = 12.76\n319 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 Approximately 319 * 0.0016 \u2248 0.5104\n\nAdding up: 31.9 + 12.76 = 44.66 + 0.5104 \u2248 45.1704\n\nSo, total 319\u03c0 \u2248 957 + 45.1704 \u2248 1002.1704\n\nSo, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.1704 \u2248 0.0009978, which is approximately 0.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval. So, n=319 is valid.\n\nSimilarly, for n=3183, as computed earlier, x\u22480.0001000028, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again for the number of integers. The formula is (upper - lower) + 1. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 is 2865. So, that seems correct.\n\nIs there any chance I missed something? For example, could there be overlapping or something else? Hmm, no, because each n gives a unique x in the interval, and since n is an integer, each x is unique. So, 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check with n=319 and n=3183.\n\nn=319: x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009978, which is in (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nn=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001000028, which is in (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nAnd n=318: x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.001001, which is just outside the upper bound, so not included.\n\nSimilarly, n=3184: x=1/(3184\u03c0). Let's compute 3184\u03c0\u22483184*3.1415926535\u22483184*3=9552, 3184*0.1415926535\u22483184*0.1=318.4, 3184*0.0415926535\u22483184*0.04=127.36, 3184*0.0015926535\u22483184*0.0016\u22485.0944. So total\u2248318.4+127.36=445.76+5.0944\u2248450.8544. So total\u22489552+450.8544\u2248999, 9552+450.8544\u2248999, wait, 9552 + 450.8544\u2248999, wait, that can't be right. Wait, 3184*\u03c0\u22483184*3.1415926535\u2248Let me compute more accurately:\n\n3184 * 3 = 9552\n3184 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3184 * 0.1 = 318.4\n3184 * 0.0415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3184 * 0.04 = 127.36\n3184 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 3184 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0944\n\nSo, adding up: 318.4 + 127.36 = 445.76 + 5.0944 \u2248 450.8544\n\nSo total 3184\u03c0 \u2248 9552 + 450.8544 \u2248 999, 9552 + 450.8544 = 999, wait, 9552 + 450.8544 = 999, no, that's not correct. Wait, 9552 + 450.8544 is actually 999, because 9552 + 450.8544 = 999, no, wait, 9552 + 450.8544 is 999, but that can't be right because 9552 + 450 is 999, but 9552 + 450 is actually 999, but 9552 + 450 is 999, which is incorrect because 9552 + 450 is 999, but that's not correct. Wait, 9552 + 450 is 999, but 9552 + 450.8544 is 999, which is less than 10,000. Wait, no, that can't be because 3184 * \u03c0 should be around 10,000, right?\n\nWait, no, 3183 * \u03c0\u224810,000, so 3184 * \u03c0\u224810,000 + \u03c0\u224810,003.14159. So, 3184\u03c0\u224810,003.14159, so 1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.000099968, which is less than 0.0001, so x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.000099968, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included in the interval. Therefore, n=3184 gives x outside the interval, so the maximum n is 3183.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is indeed 2865.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

Let me write that down as inequalities: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. I can solve these inequalities for n to find the range of integers that satisfy them.\n\nFirst, let's solve 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that flipping inequalities when reciprocating (since all terms are positive), it becomes 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Calculating 1/0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, which is approximately 3.14159, gives n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: 10000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 10000 / 3.14159 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.098.\n\nNext, let's solve the other inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n > 1000 / \u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 / 3.14159 \u2248 318.309. Therefore, n must be greater than approximately 318.309.\n\nSince n has to be an integer, the values of n that satisfy both inequalities are integers from 319 up to 3183, because 3183 is less than 3183.098, and 318 is less than 318.309, so the next integer is 319.\n\nNow, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the numbers, it's 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations. So, 3183 minus 319: 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then minus 19 is 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct.\n\nBut hold on, I should make sure that both endpoints are included. The original interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, meaning it doesn't include the endpoints. So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. Therefore, x cannot be equal to 0.0001 or 0.001, but since x = 1/(n\u03c0), we need to check if n=319 gives x just above 0.001 and n=3183 gives x just below 0.0001.\n\nWait, actually, let me think again. When n increases, x decreases because x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, the smallest n is 319, which gives the largest x in the interval, and the largest n is 3183, which gives the smallest x in the interval.\n\nWait, let me compute x for n=319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(319*3.14159) \u2248 1/1003.03 \u2248 0.000997. Hmm, that's just below 0.001, right? Because 0.001 is 1/1000, so 1/1003.03 is approximately 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval.\n\nSimilarly, for n=3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183*3.14159) \u2248 1/10000.003 \u2248 0.0000999999, which is just above 0.0001, since 0.0001 is 1/10000. So, 0.0000999999 is less than 0.0001? Wait, no, 0.0000999999 is 9.99999e-5, which is less than 0.0001 (which is 1e-4). So, actually, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0000999999, which is less than 0.0001. Wait, that's a problem because our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001. So, does x = 1/(3183\u03c0) lie within the interval?\n\nWait, let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0) more accurately. 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.0415926535 \u2248 let's compute 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, and 3183 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 approximately 5.06. So adding up: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.06 \u2248 450.68. So total is 9549 + 450.68 \u2248 9999.68. Therefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.68 \u2248 0.0001000032. Wait, that's approximately 0.0001000032, which is just above 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000032, which is indeed greater than 0.0001, so it's within the interval.\n\nSimilarly, for n=319: 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1003.03 \u2248 0.00099697, which is just below 0.001, so it's within the interval.\n\nWait, so n=319 gives x \u2248 0.00099697, which is within (0.0001, 0.001), and n=3183 gives x \u2248 0.0001000032, which is also within the interval. So, both endpoints are included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving us 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the exact values. Let me compute 1/(319\u03c0) precisely. Using a calculator, 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477, 19\u03c0 \u2248 59.690, so total \u2248 942.477 + 59.690 \u2248 1002.167. Therefore, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.167 \u2248 0.00099783, which is approximately 0.00099783, which is less than 0.001, so it's inside the interval.\n\nSimilarly, 3183\u03c0: 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.777, 183\u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 180\u03c0 \u2248 565.486, and 3\u03c0 \u2248 9.42477. So, 565.486 + 9.42477 \u2248 574.9107. Therefore, total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.777 + 574.9107 \u2248 9999.6877. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.6877 \u2248 0.0001000032, which is just above 0.0001, so it's within the interval.\n\nSo, both n=319 and n=3183 give x-values within (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of integers n from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, there are 2865 x-intercepts in that interval.\n\nWait, but I should check if n=3183 is included. Since 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000032 is just above 0.0001, which is the lower bound of the interval. The interval is open, so it doesn't include 0.0001, but since 0.0001000032 is greater than 0.0001, it's included. Similarly, n=319 gives x \u2248 0.00099783, which is less than 0.001, so it's included as well. So, both endpoints are valid, and hence, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, the number of intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when n increases by 1, x decreases by 1/(n+1)\u03c0 - 1/(n\u03c0) \u2248 something small, but each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept in the interval. So, each integer n in that range corresponds to exactly one x-intercept in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the count is indeed 2865.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 1/(n\u03c0) between these values. Solving for n gives n between approximately 318.31 and 3183.098. Thus, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, yielding 2865 intercepts.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

Let me write that down as inequalities:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nI need to solve for n here. Let me take the reciprocal of all parts, remembering that flipping inequalities when taking reciprocals (since all terms are positive). So:\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001.\n\nCalculating those reciprocals:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nNow, divide each part by \u03c0 to solve for n:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nLet me compute these values. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So:\n\n1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184.\n\nSimilarly, 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nSince n has to be an integer, n must be greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184. So, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183.\n\nNow, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the values:\n\nNumber of integers = 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864.\n\nThen, 2864 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, let me double-check that subtraction. 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then minus 19 more is 2864. Yeah, that's correct. So, adding 1 gives 2865.\n\nBut hold on, let me make sure that 3183 is indeed less than 10000/\u03c0. Since 10000/\u03c0 is approximately 3183.09886184, so 3183 is less than that. Similarly, 319 is greater than 1000/\u03c0 which is approximately 318.309886184. So, 319 is indeed the next integer after that.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts should be 2865.\n\nWait a second, let me think again. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001). So, x is greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, when I take x = 1/(n\u03c0), n must be such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in that interval. So, n must be between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which we found as approximately 318.31 to 3183.0988. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864.\n\n2864 + 1 = 2865.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nBut wait, is there a possibility that when n is 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) is just over 0.0001, and when n is 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is just under 0.001? Let me check.\n\nCompute 1/(319\u03c0):\n\n1/(319 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(1001.390) \u2248 0.0009986, which is approximately 0.0009986, which is less than 0.001. Wait, but 0.0009986 is less than 0.001, so x = 0.0009986 is just under 0.001, which is within the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but 1/(319\u03c0) is approximately 0.0009986, which is about 0.001, but 0.001 is the upper limit. Since the interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), does that include 0.001? No, it doesn't. So, x must be less than 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) must be less than 0.001, so n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31, so n starts at 319, as before.\n\nSimilarly, the lower end: 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001, so n must be less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988. So, n goes up to 3183, since 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001001, which is just over 0.0001. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, does 0.0001 included? No, it doesn't. So, we need 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which implies n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988. So, n must be less than that, so the maximum integer n is 3183. But wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001001, which is just over 0.0001, so that's acceptable because x must be greater than 0.0001. So, 3183 is acceptable.\n\nWait, but if n=3183, then x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001001, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.0009986, which is just below 0.001, so it's included.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me check if n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001001, which is just over 0.0001, so it's within the interval. Similarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.0009986, which is just under 0.001, so also within the interval.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when n increases, x decreases. So, as n goes from 319 to 3183, x goes from approximately 0.0009986 down to approximately 0.0001001. So, each n corresponds to an x in the interval, and each x in the interval corresponds to a unique n. So, the count should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about how many periods of sin(1/x) there are in the interval. But perhaps that's complicating it more than necessary.\n\nWait, another way: The function sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. Between x=0.0001 and x=0.001, which is a very small interval near zero, the function oscillates infinitely many times, but in this case, we're only considering x down to 0.0001, so it's a finite number of oscillations. Each oscillation crosses zero twice, except perhaps the first one. Wait, no, each period of sin(\u03b8) is 2\u03c0, and each period has two zeros. So, perhaps the number of zeros is related to how many periods fit into the interval.\n\nWait, but in this case, we have x going from 0.0001 to 0.001, so 1/x goes from 1000 to 10000. So, \u03b8 = 1/x goes from 1000 to 10000 radians. The number of zeros of sin(\u03b8) between \u03b8=1000 and \u03b8=10000 is equal to the number of times \u03b8 crosses a multiple of \u03c0, which is every \u03c0 radians. So, the number of zeros is approximately (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 \u2248 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866. But wait, that's not matching exactly with the previous count. Wait, 9000/\u03c0 is approximately 2866.197, so that would suggest about 2866 zeros. But earlier, I got 2865. Hmm, so which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the number of zeros of sin(\u03b8) between \u03b8=a and \u03b8=b is floor(b/\u03c0) - ceil(a/\u03c0) + 1, I think. Because each zero occurs at \u03b8 = n\u03c0, so the number of zeros between a and b is the number of integers n where a < n\u03c0 < b, which is floor(b/\u03c0) - ceil(a/\u03c0) + 1.\n\nIn this case, a = 1000, b = 10000.\n\nSo, number of zeros = floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0) + 1.\n\nCompute 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so floor of that is 3183.\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so ceil of that is 319.\n\nSo, number of zeros = 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nAh, so that matches my initial calculation. So, 2865 zeros.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that each period has two zeros, so perhaps the number of zeros is approximately 2*(b - a)/(2\u03c0) ) = (b - a)/\u03c0, which is (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 \u2248 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.197, which is about 2866. But according to the exact count using floor and ceiling, it's 2865.\n\nSo, the discrepancy is because when you calculate (b - a)/\u03c0, you're getting an approximate, but the exact count is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think: Each zero occurs at \u03b8 = n\u03c0, so between \u03b8=1000 and \u03b8=10000, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so n starts at 319, and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so n ends at 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nTherefore, the exact number is 2865.\n\nSo, the answer should be 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check with specific values. For example, when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009986, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. When n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001001, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, both ends are included, so the count is correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought about the number of periods, which would be (10000 - 1000)/(2\u03c0) \u2248 9000/(6.283185307) \u2248 1432.39. So, about 1432 periods, each with two zeros, so about 2864 zeros. But that's approximate, and the exact count is 2865. So, the exact count is one more than that approximation. That makes sense because the exact count includes both endpoints if they fall exactly on a zero, but in our case, the endpoints don't fall exactly on a zero, but the zeros are just inside the interval.\n\nWait, but in our case, the interval is open, so the endpoints aren't included, but the zeros are just inside, so perhaps that's why the count is 2865.\n\nWait, no, in our case, the zeros occur at x=1/(n\u03c0), which are strictly inside (0.0001, 0.001) for n from 319 to 3183. So, the count is exactly 2865.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0, leading to x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 1/(n\u03c0) must be between 0.0001 and 0.001. Solving for n gives n between 319 and 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

Let me calculate that. 1000 divided by 3 is approximately 333.333, and since \u03c0 is a bit more than 3, the result will be a bit less than 333.333. Let me compute it more accurately. \n\nUsing a calculator, 1000 \u00f7 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. So, n must be at least approximately 318.309886184. Since n must be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319 because 318.309886184 is just a bit more than 318, so n starts at 319. \n\nNow, the upper limit: 10000 divided by \u03c0. That's 10000 / 3.1415926535. Let me compute that. 10000 divided by 3 is approximately 3333.333, but again, since \u03c0 is a bit more than 3, the result will be a bit less than 3333.333. Let me compute it accurately. \n\n10000 \u00f7 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be at most approximately 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, the largest possible n is 3183 because 3183.09886184 is just a bit more than 3183, so n goes up to 3183. \n\nNow, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the numbers: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, 3183 minus 319. Let's do 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. \n\nBut wait, let me check that calculation again. 3183 - 319: Let's do it step by step. 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. Yes, that's correct. \n\nBut hold on, I should make sure that each integer n from 319 to 3183 corresponds to a unique x in (0.0001, 0.001). Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), and as n increases, x decreases. So, for each n, we have a unique x in the interval. So, each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept. \n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is equal to the number of integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive, which is 2865. \n\nWait, but let me confirm if n=319 gives x within the interval. x = 1/(319\u03c0). Let's compute that. 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477, and 19\u03c0 \u2248 59.690. So, total \u2248 942.477 + 59.690 \u2248 1002.167. So, x \u2248 1/1002.167 \u2248 0.0009978, which is approximately 0.0009978. Now, 0.0001 is 0.0001, and 0.001 is 0.001. So, 0.0009978 is just a bit less than 0.001, so it's within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nSimilarly, for n=3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0). Let's compute that. 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 let's see, 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.777, and 183\u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 100\u03c0 \u2248 314.159, 80\u03c0 \u2248 251.327, 3\u03c0 \u2248 9.424, so total \u2248 314.159 + 251.327 = 565.486 + 9.424 \u2248 574.91. So, 3000\u03c0 + 183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.777 + 574.91 \u2248 1000, approximately? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 3183\u03c0 is approximately 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute that more accurately. \n\n3183 * 3.1415926535: Let's break it down. 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 180 * \u03c0 \u2248 565.4867, 3 * \u03c0 \u2248 9.424777. Adding them together: 9424.77796 + 565.4867 \u2248 9990.26466 + 9.424777 \u2248 9999.689437. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.689437 \u2248 0.0001000032. Wait, that's just a bit more than 0.0001, right? Because 1/10000 is 0.0001, so 1/9999.689437 is approximately 0.0001000032, which is just a hair above 0.0001. But our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.0001, so x must be greater than 0.0001. So, 0.0001000032 is just barely above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. \n\nWait, but let me check: 0.0001 is 1e-4, and 0.0001000032 is 1.000032e-4, which is indeed greater than 1e-4. So, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is within the interval. \n\nWait, but earlier when I calculated n=319, x was approximately 0.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so that's within the interval as well. So, both n=319 and n=3183 correspond to x-values within (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nBut wait, let me check if n=319 is the first n where x is still in the interval. Let's check n=318: x=1/(318\u03c0). 318\u03c0 \u2248 318 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477, 18\u03c0 \u2248 56.548, so total \u2248 942.477 + 56.548 \u2248 999.025. So, x=1/999.025 \u2248 0.001001001, which is just a bit more than 0.001, so it's outside the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=318 corresponds to x\u22480.001001, which is just above 0.001, so it's not included. Hence, the smallest n is indeed 319, as previously determined. \n\nSimilarly, let's check n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001000032, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. Now, what about n=3184? Let's compute x=1/(3184\u03c0). 3184\u03c0 \u2248 3184 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute 3000\u03c0\u22489424.777, 184\u03c0\u2248578.024. So, 9424.777 + 578.024\u22489999.801. So, x\u22481/9999.801\u22480.000100002, which is still just above 0.0001, so it's included. Wait, but earlier I thought n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001000032, which is just above 0.0001, so n=3183 is included, and n=3184 would give x\u22480.000100002, which is also just above 0.0001, so it's included as well. Wait, but wait, 1/(n\u03c0) decreases as n increases, so as n increases, x decreases. So, n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001000032, and n=3184 gives x\u22480.000100002, which is slightly less, but still above 0.0001. So, both are included. Wait, but how does that affect our count? \n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because when I calculated 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.09886184, which means that n can go up to 3183, because 3183\u03c0\u22489999.689, which is less than 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001000032 is within the interval. However, n=3184 would give 3184\u03c0\u22483184*3.1415926535\u2248let me compute that accurately. Let's compute 3184 * \u03c0: \n\n3184 * 3 = 9552, 3184 * 0.1415926535\u22483184 * 0.1415926535. Let me compute that: 3184 * 0.1 = 318.4, 3184 * 0.0415926535\u22483184 * 0.04 = 127.36, 3184 * 0.0015926535\u2248approximately 5.06. So, total\u2248318.4 + 127.36 = 445.76 + 5.06\u2248450.82. So, total 3184\u03c0\u22489552 + 450.82\u22489999.82. Wait, that can't be right because 3184 is larger than 3183, so 3184\u03c0 should be larger than 3183\u03c0\u22489999.689. Wait, but 3184\u03c0\u22483184*3.1415926535\u2248let me use a calculator approach: 3184 * 3.1415926535. \n\nWait, 3184 * 3 = 9552, 3184 * 0.1415926535\u22483184 * 0.1415926535. Let me compute 3184 * 0.1=318.4, 3184*0.04=127.36, 3184*0.0015926535\u22485.06. So, adding those: 318.4 + 127.36 = 445.76 + 5.06\u2248450.82. So, total 3184\u03c0\u22489552 + 450.82\u22489999.82. So, x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22481/9999.82\u22480.0001000018, which is still just above 0.0001, so it's included. \n\nWait a second, that suggests that n can go beyond 3183, but that contradicts my earlier calculation where 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.09886184, so n=3183.09886184 would give x=10000/\u03c0\u22483183.09886184\u03c0\u224810000. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 1/x= n\u03c0, so x=1/(n\u03c0). So, if x=0.0001, then n=1/(0.0001\u03c0)=10000/\u03c0\u22483183.09886184. So, n must be less than or equal to 3183.09886184, so the maximum integer n is 3183. Therefore, n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0001000018, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. But wait, if x must be greater than 0.0001, then 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which implies n\u03c0 < 10000, so n < 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.09886184. Therefore, n can be up to 3183, because 3183 < 3183.09886184, but 3184 would be greater than 3183.09886184, so n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0001000018, which is still greater than 0.0001, but n=3184 would be beyond the limit because n must be less than 3183.09886184. Wait, but 3184 is greater than 3183.09886184, so n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0001000018, which is still greater than 0.0001, but n=3184 is beyond the upper limit. Wait, this is confusing. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, x must be greater than 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. That implies that n\u03c0 < 10000, so n < 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.09886184. So, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so the maximum integer n is 3183. Therefore, n=3184 would give n\u03c0\u22483184*3.1415926535\u224810000.000..., which would make x=1/(n\u03c0)=0.0001 exactly, but since the interval is open at 0.0001, x must be greater than 0.0001, so n=3184 gives x=0.0001 exactly, which is excluded. Therefore, n can only go up to 3183, which gives x\u22480.0001000032, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. \n\nWait, so that means the maximum n is 3183, and the minimum n is 319. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again. 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that's 2865 integers. Therefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nBut wait, let me just confirm that there are no overlaps or missed intercepts. Each n corresponds to exactly one x in the interval, and each x in the interval corresponds to exactly one n. So, the count should be accurate. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the number of zeros of sin(1/x) in (a, b) is equal to the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (a, b). So, solving for n, we get n in (1/(b\u03c0), 1/(a\u03c0)). Since a=0.0001 and b=0.001, 1/a=10000 and 1/b=1000. So, n must be in (1000/\u03c0, 10000/\u03c0). As we calculated earlier, that's approximately (318.309886184, 3183.09886184). So, the number of integers in this interval is floor(3183.09886184) - ceil(318.309886184) + 1. Which is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. \n\nSo, I think that's correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

    "text": " \n\nSo, essentially, the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer values of n. Now, I need to find all such x that lie within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Let me write that down: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. \n\nWait, actually, since x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, and x = 1/(n\u03c0), that would mean that 1/(n\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, flipping the inequalities, because if I take reciprocals, the inequalities reverse. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Let me calculate those values. \n\n1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, dividing each part by \u03c0, which is approximately 3.1415926535, I get 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. \n\nCalculating those values: 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. \n\nSince n has to be an integer, n must be greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184. So, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183. \n\nNow, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, no, actually, it's 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that. \n\n3183 - 319 is 2864, and then adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies within (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nBut wait a second, let me double-check that. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 minus 300 is 2883, minus 19 more is 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. Yep, that seems right. \n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the reciprocals. The original interval is x between 0.0001 and 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), then n\u03c0 must be between 1/0.001 and 1/0.0001, which is 1000 and 10000. So, n must be between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.309886184 to 3183.09886184. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, inclusive. \n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is the number of integer n's in that range, which is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. \n\nWait, but I should also consider whether 1/(n\u03c0) is strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. So, does n = 319 give x = 1/(319\u03c0)? Let me compute 1/(319\u03c0). 319 times \u03c0 is approximately 319 * 3.14159265 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's see, 300*3.1416=942.48, 19*3.1416\u224859.6904, so total \u2248 942.48 + 59.6904 \u2248 1002.1704. So, 1/1002.1704 \u2248 0.0009978, which is approximately 0.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so that's within the interval. \n\nSimilarly, for n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0). Let's compute 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's approximate. 3000*3.1416=9424.8, 183*3.1416\u2248575.1528, so total \u2248 9424.8 + 575.1528 \u2248 10,000. So, 1/10,000 is 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 is just a bit more than 10,000, x is just a bit less than 0.0001. Wait, but our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001. So, does 1/(3183\u03c0) equal exactly 0.0001? No, because 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but slightly less. So, does that mean that x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001? Because if 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, then 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but actually, since 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10,000, 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001. So, does that mean that x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is just below 0.0001, which is outside the interval (0.0001, 0.001)? \n\nWait, so does that mean that n can only go up to 3182? Because 3182\u03c0 would be 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 let's compute that. 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's see, 3000*3.1416=9424.8, 182*3.1416\u2248572. So, 9424.8 + 572 \u2248 10,000 - 10,000 is 10,000, so 3182\u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 10,000 - (\u03c0*(3183 - 3182)) \u2248 10,000 - \u03c0 \u2248 10,000 - 3.1416 \u2248 9996.8584. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.8584 \u2248 0.00010003, which is just above 0.0001. So, that's within the interval. \n\nWait, so when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but slightly less, so it's below 0.0001, which is outside the interval. So, n can only go up to 3182. \n\nSo, that would mean that n starts at 319 and ends at 3182, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that. 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 is 2864. So, 2864 intercepts. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought n went up to 3183, but now I see that n=3183 gives x just below 0.0001, which is outside the interval. So, n should go up to 3182. So, the number of intercepts is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this more carefully. Let me compute 1/(3182\u03c0) and 1/(3183\u03c0) to see where they lie. \n\nCompute 3182\u03c0: 3182 * 3.14159265 \u2248 let's compute 3000\u03c0 = 9424.77796, 182\u03c0 \u2248 571.8978. So, total \u2248 9424.77796 + 571.8978 \u2248 9996.67576. So, 1/9996.67576 \u2248 0.000100033, which is just above 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100033, which is within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nNow, 3183\u03c0: 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 let's compute 3000\u03c0 = 9424.77796, 183\u03c0 \u2248 575.1528. So, total \u2248 9424.77796 + 575.1528 \u2248 10,000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but slightly less, because 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10,000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's just below the lower bound of the interval. \n\nTherefore, n can only go up to 3182, because n=3183 gives x just below 0.0001, which is outside the interval. So, the upper limit for n is 3182. \n\nSimilarly, for the lower end, n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 1002.1704, so 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so that's within the interval. \n\nSo, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3182. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3182 inclusive, it's 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 is 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, there are 2864 integer values of n, which correspond to 2864 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused now because earlier I thought it was 2865, but after checking, it's 2864. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the subtraction. 3182 minus 319: 3182 - 300 is 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863. Then, adding 1 gives 2864. Yes, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the number of integers from 1 to 3182 is 3182, and from 1 to 318 is 318, so subtracting gives 3182 - 318 = 2864. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, because n starts at 319, which is 318 + 1. So, the number of terms from 319 to 3182 inclusive is (3182 - 319) + 1 = 2864. \n\nYes, that's correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. \n\nBut wait, let me think again. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. So, between 0.0001 and 0.001, it's oscillating a lot. Each oscillation crosses the x-axis twice, once going up and once going down. Wait, no, actually, each period of the sine function is 2\u03c0, so each period would have one maximum, one minimum, and two x-intercepts. Wait, but in terms of x, each x-intercept corresponds to a solution of sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, each x-intercept is at x = 1/(n\u03c0), and each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept. So, the number of x-intercepts is equal to the number of integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies within (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nSo, as we found earlier, n ranges from 319 to 3182, inclusive, giving 2864 x-intercepts. \n\nWait, but I just realized that when I computed n from 319 to 3182, I got 2864, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, which one is correct? Let me check again. \n\nThe formula is: number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a = 319, b = 3182. So, 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. So, that's correct. \n\nBut let me check with a smaller example to make sure. Suppose I have numbers from 3 to 5 inclusive. 5 - 3 + 1 = 3 numbers: 3,4,5. That's correct. So, applying that to 319 to 3182, it's 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. \n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is the function sin(1/x) has a period of 2\u03c0 in terms of \u03b8 = 1/x. So, as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001, \u03b8 increases from 1000 to 10000. So, the number of periods is (10000 - 1000)/(2\u03c0) = 9000/(2\u03c0) \u2248 4500/\u03c0 \u2248 1432.396. So, each period has two x-intercepts, so total x-intercepts would be approximately 2 * 1432 = 2864. So, that matches our earlier count. \n\nWait, that's interesting. So, that method also gives 2864 x-intercepts. So, that seems to confirm that 2864 is the correct number. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the number of x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2864. \n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it in a couple of different ways, so I'm confident that's the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

    "text": " \n\nSo, the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n. Now, I need to find all such x that lie within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Let me write that down: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. \n\nTo find the possible values of n, I should solve this inequality for n. Let me first consider the left part of the inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that flipping inequalities when reciprocating reverses them if both sides are positive, which they are here. So, 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Calculating 1/0.0001 gives me 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, I get n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1416 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.098.\n\nNow, looking at the right part of the inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n\u03c0 > 1000, which implies n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309.\n\nSince n has to be an integer, n must satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Let me check that again. If n > 318.309, the smallest integer n is 319. And n < 3183.098, so the largest integer n is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive.\n\nNow, I need to find how many integers are in this range. To find the number of integers from a to b inclusive, it's b - a + 1. So, plugging in the numbers: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that step by step. 3183 - 319 is... let's see, 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives me 2865. So, there are 2865 integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that calculation because that seems like a lot of intercepts. So, the interval is from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is a pretty narrow range near zero. But since 1/x is a rapidly increasing function as x approaches zero, the function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x gets closer to zero. So, it's plausible that there are many x-intercepts in that interval.\n\nBut let me confirm the bounds again. The x-intercepts are at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, when x is 0.0001, that corresponds to n = 1/(0.0001 * \u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so n is approximately 3183. Similarly, when x is 0.001, n = 1/(0.001 * \u03c0) \u2248 318.309, so n is approximately 318.309. Therefore, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nWait, 3183 minus 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, that seems correct. Hmm, but 2865 intercepts in that tiny interval? That seems like a lot, but considering the function oscillates infinitely as x approaches zero, I guess it makes sense. So, I think my reasoning is correct.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The x-intercepts occur where sin(1/x) = 0, which happens when 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). I need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n, I get n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183. The number of integers in that range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that should be the number of x-intercepts in the given interval.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think the answer is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts at x = 1/(n\u03c0) where n is an integer. To find the number of such x in (0.0001, 0.001), we solve 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, leading to n ranging from 319 to 3183. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

Let me write that down: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. I can solve this inequality for n to find the range of integers that satisfy it.\n\nFirst, let's solve the left part of the inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that taking reciprocals reverses the inequality, I get 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Calculating 1/0.0001, that's 10,000. So, 10,000 > n\u03c0, which means n < 10,000/\u03c0. Let me compute 10,000 divided by \u03c0. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10,000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n is an integer, the maximum possible n here is 3183.\n\nNow, let's solve the right part of the inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that, 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. Since n must be an integer greater than this value, the smallest possible n here is 319.\n\nSo, n must be an integer from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to count how many integers are in this range. To find the number of integers from a to b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. But wait, in this case, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that.\n\n3183 minus 319 is... Let's see, 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more, which is 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that subtraction. 3183 - 319. Let me compute 3183 - 300 first, which is 2883, then subtract 19 more, so 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in determining the range of n. The x-intercepts are at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, for each integer n, we have an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). Now, we're looking for x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001.\n\nSo, substituting x = 1/(n\u03c0), we get 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me verify the inequalities again.\n\nStarting with 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0 (which is positive, so inequality remains the same), we get 0.0001 * n\u03c0 < 1. Then, dividing both sides by 0.0001, we have n\u03c0 < 10,000, so n < 10,000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n can be up to 3183.\n\nSimilarly, for 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, multiplying both sides by n\u03c0 gives 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0. Then, dividing both sides by 0.001, we get n\u03c0 > 1000, so n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be at least 319.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again to be sure.\n\n3183 - 319: Let's break it down. 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more, so 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, 2865 integers. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but I should check if n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0). Let me compute that to make sure it's greater than 0.0001. 3183\u03c0 is approximately 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 10,000 (since 3183 is approximately 10,000/\u03c0). So, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, which is the lower bound. But the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001. So, does x=1/(3183\u03c0) equal exactly 0.0001? Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0):\n\n3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, and 183\u03c0 \u2248 575.286. So, total is approximately 9424.77796 + 575.286 \u2248 10,000.064. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10,000.064 \u2248 0.000099999, which is just slightly less than 0.0001. So, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.000099999, which is less than 0.0001. So, it's outside the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 gives x just below 0.0001, which is not included in the interval. So, the maximum n should be 3182 instead of 3183.\n\nWait, that changes things. Let me recast the problem. So, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not in the interval. Therefore, the maximum n for which x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is when n is such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, solving for n, n < 10,000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, the maximum integer n is 3183, but as we saw, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is just below 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the maximum n that gives x > 0.0001 is n=3182.\n\nWait, let me check that. Let's compute x when n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0). Let's compute 3182\u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.14159265 \u2248 3182 * 3 = 9546, 3182 * 0.14159265 \u2248 3182 * 0.14 \u2248 445.48, so total \u2248 9546 + 445.48 \u2248 9991.48. So, 1/(9991.48) \u2248 0.000100085, which is greater than 0.0001. So, x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100085, which is within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3182 is valid, but n=3183 is not. So, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nSimilarly, let's check n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0). Let's compute 319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.14159265 \u2248 319 * 3 = 957, 319 * 0.14159265 \u2248 319 * 0.14 \u2248 44.66, so total \u2248 957 + 44.66 \u2248 1001.66. So, 1/1001.66 \u2248 0.0009983, which is less than 0.001. So, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009983, which is within the interval. So, n=319 is valid.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n starts at 319 because 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, so n must be greater than that, so n=319 is the smallest integer. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, now, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\nLet me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then adding 1 gives 2864. So, there are 2864 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n=3183 was giving x just below 0.0001, so it's excluded, so n goes up to 3182. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another approach. Let's consider that n must satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nSo, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 10,000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618, so n \u2264 3183.\n\nBut as we saw, n=3183 gives x \u2248 0.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so n must be \u2264 3182.\n\nSimilarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, so n \u2265 319.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nNumber of integers = 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\nCompute 3182 - 319:\n\n3182 - 300 = 2882\n\n2882 - 19 = 2863\n\nThen, 2863 + 1 = 2864.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but after realizing that n=3183 is excluded, it's 2864.\n\nLet me check with n=319 and n=3182:\n\nn=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009983 < 0.001, so included.\n\nn=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100085 > 0.0001, so included.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is indeed 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought n=3183 was excluded, I had to subtract one from the initial count. So, let me see: initially, I thought n ranges from 319 to 3183, which would be 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. But since n=3183 is excluded, it's actually 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nSo, the correct number is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not making a miscalculation in the number of integers. Let's consider a smaller example. Suppose I have numbers from 3 to 5 inclusive. That's 3,4,5: 3 numbers. So, 5 - 3 + 1 = 3. Similarly, from 3 to 4 inclusive: 2 numbers. 4 - 3 + 1 = 2.\n\nSo, applying that, from 319 to 3182 inclusive: 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19: 2882 - 19 = 2863. Then, 2863 + 1 = 2864.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the number of integers from 1 to 3182 is 3182, and the number of integers from 1 to 318 is 318. So, the number from 319 to 3182 is 3182 - 318 = 2864. Yes, that's another way to see it.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check if I missed any edge cases. For example, when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009983, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. When n=3182, x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100085, which is greater than 0.0001, so included. And n=3183 gives x\u22480.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so excluded.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the initial approach. I had n starting at 319 and ending at 3183, but n=3183 is excluded, so it's up to 3182. So, the count is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the values of x. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001). So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 0.0001 < x < 0.001.\n\nSince x = 1/(n\u03c0), we can write 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nWhich is equivalent to 1/(0.001) > n\u03c0 > 1/(0.0001).\n\nSo, 1000 > n\u03c0 > 10,000.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because taking reciprocals reverses the inequalities. Let me correct that.\n\nFrom 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, taking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities):\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001.\n\nSo, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10,000.\n\nThen, dividing by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10,000/\u03c0.\n\nWhich is approximately 318.30988618 < n < 3183.0988618.\n\nSo, n must be an integer from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nBut as we saw, n=3183 gives x\u22480.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, n must be from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but in this approach, I initially thought n goes up to 3183, but upon checking, n=3183 is excluded, so it's up to 3182. So, the count is 2864.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me try to compute 3182 - 319 + 1 again.\n\n3182 - 319: Let's compute 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863. Then, adding 1: 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, yes, 2864.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the number of terms in the sequence from 319 to 3182 inclusive. The formula for the number of terms is (last - first) + 1, so (3182 - 319) + 1 = 2864.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- The x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n.\n\n- We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\n- Solving for n, we find 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3182.\n\n- The number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we determine where \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\). This occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for integer \\( n \\), leading to \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n\nWe need \\( 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\), which translates to:\n- \\( \\frac{1}{0.001} < n\\pi < \\frac{1}{0.0001} \\)\n- \\( 1000 < n\\pi < 10,000 \\)\n- Dividing by \\( \\pi \\), we get \\( \\frac{1000}{\\pi} < n < \\frac{10,000}{\\pi} \\)\n- Approximating, \\( 318.31 < n < 3183.098 \\)\n\nThus, \\( n \\) ranges from 319 to 3182. The number of integers in this range is:\n- \\( 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864 \\)\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}."

    "text": " So, each x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n. \n\nNow, I need to find all such x that lie in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). That means I need to find all integers n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me write that down:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nI can rewrite this inequality to solve for n. Let's start with the left part:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0)\n\nIf I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that flipping the inequality sign when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive:\n\n1/0.0001 > n\u03c0\n\nWhich is:\n\n10000 > n\u03c0\n\nSimilarly, for the right part:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nTaking reciprocals again:\n\nn\u03c0 > 1/0.001\n\nWhich is:\n\nn\u03c0 > 1000\n\nSo, combining both inequalities, I have:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nLet me compute these values. Since \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, let me calculate 1000 divided by \u03c0 and 10000 divided by \u03c0.\n\nFirst, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184\n\nSimilarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184.\n\nSince n has to be an integer, n can take integer values from the next integer after 318.309886184, which is 319, up to the integer just below 3183.09886184, which is 3183.\n\nNow, to find how many integers are in this range, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of integers n is:\n\nNumber of n = 3183 - 319 + 1\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\n2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nWait, hold on, that can't be right. Wait, 3183 - 319 is 2864, but adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, but let me check: if n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183, inclusive, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me verify with a smaller example: say from 3 to 5, inclusive. 5 - 3 + 1 = 3, which is correct: 3,4,5. So, yes, the formula is correct.\n\nSo, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) lies in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in that interval.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because 2865 seems like a lot, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the arithmetic.\n\nFirst, 1000/\u03c0 is approximately 318.309886184, so the smallest integer n is 319. Then, 10000/\u03c0 is approximately 3183.09886184, so the largest integer n is 3183.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that step by step:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\n2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 2865 is the number of x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me think again: the interval is (0.0001, 0.001). So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, 1/x must be in (1000, 10000). So, n\u03c0 must be in (1000, 10000). So, n must be in (1000/\u03c0, 10000/\u03c0), which is approximately (318.309886184, 3183.09886184). So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of n is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because 2865 seems like a very large number of intercepts in such a small interval. Let me think: as x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is from 0.0001 to 0.001, that's a very narrow interval near zero. So, the function sin(1/x) will oscillate very rapidly in this interval, crossing the x-axis each time 1/x is a multiple of \u03c0. So, the number of intercepts should be roughly proportional to the length of the interval in terms of 1/x. Let me see: the interval for x is from 0.0001 to 0.001, so in terms of 1/x, that's from 1000 to 10000. The distance between consecutive zeros of sin(1/x) is when 1/x increases by \u03c0, so the number of zeros should be approximately (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0, which is 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.197. Hmm, that's close to 2865, so that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but I got 2865, and the approximate value is 2866.197. So, that's almost the same, which makes sense because we're dealing with integer counts.\n\nWait, but let me check: if I have 1/x from 1000 to 10000, that's a span of 9000. Each zero occurs every \u03c0 units in 1/x, so the number of zeros is approximately 9000/\u03c0, which is about 2866.197. Since n must be an integer, the number of zeros would be the floor of 10000/\u03c0 minus the ceiling of 1000/\u03c0, which is 3183 - 319 = 2864, but then we have to add 1 to include both endpoints, so 2865. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again: if n starts at 319, then the first x-intercept is at x = 1/(319\u03c0), which is approximately 1/(1002.506) \u2248 0.0009975, which is just above 0.0001. The last x-intercept is at x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10002.506) \u2248 0.000099975, which is just below 0.001. Wait, no, wait: 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 1/(10002.506) \u2248 0.000099975, which is less than 0.0001, so that's outside the interval. Wait, that can't be right because 0.000099975 is less than 0.0001, so x must be greater than 0.0001, so 1/x must be less than 10000. Wait, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.000099975, which is less than 0.0001, so that x is outside the interval. Therefore, the largest n such that 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 is n = floor(10000/\u03c0) = 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.000099975, which is less than 0.0001, so that x is less than 0.0001, which is outside our interval. Therefore, the largest n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001 is when n is such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, so n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, the largest integer n is 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.000099975, which is less than 0.0001, so that x is less than 0.0001, which is outside our interval. Therefore, the largest n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001 is when n is less than 3183.09886184, so the largest integer n is 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, which is outside the interval. Therefore, the largest n such that x is in (0.0001, 0.001) is n = 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000 - \u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is still less than 0.0001. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099975, which is less than 0.0001. So, to have x > 0.0001, we need n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so n must be less than that, so the largest integer n is 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so that's not in the interval. Therefore, the largest n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001 is n = floor(10000/\u03c0) - 1 = 3183 - 1 = 3182. Let me check 1/(3182\u03c0): 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute that:\n\n3182 * 3 = 9546\n3182 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3182 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3182 * 0.1416 \u2248 3182 * 0.1 = 318.2; 3182 * 0.04 = 127.28; 3182 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0912. Adding up: 318.2 + 127.28 = 445.48 + 5.0912 \u2248 450.5712. So total is 9546 + 450.5712 \u2248 9996.5712. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.5712 \u2248 0.000100034, which is just above 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100034, which is in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n can go up to 3182. Wait, but earlier I thought n goes up to 3183, but that gives x less than 0.0001, which is outside. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nWe have x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < x < 0.001.\n\nWe have x = 1/(n\u03c0), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nTaking reciprocals:\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nTherefore, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nSince n must be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319, and the largest possible n is 3183. But wait, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000099975<0.0001, which is outside the interval. So, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so the largest integer n is 3183, but that gives x less than 0.0001. Therefore, the largest n such that x > 0.0001 is n=3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.000100034>0.0001.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory. Let me check:\n\nIf n=3182, then x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.000100034, which is just above 0.0001, so it's in the interval.\n\nIf n=3183, x\u22480.000099975, which is below 0.0001, so not in the interval.\n\nSo, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nSimilarly, the minimum n is 319, because n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.0009975, which is less than 0.001? Wait, no, wait: 1/(318\u03c0)\u22481/(1000.076)\u22480.0009999, which is just below 0.001, so x=0.0009999 is less than 0.001, so it's in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but earlier I thought n starts at 319, but if n=318 gives x\u22480.0009999, which is less than 0.001, so it's in the interval. Wait, so perhaps n can be as low as 319, but wait, 1/(319\u03c0)\u22481/(1002.506)\u22480.0009975, which is less than 0.001, so x=0.0009975 is in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n=319 gives x\u22480.0009975, which is in the interval. But wait, n=318 gives x\u22480.0009999, which is still in the interval. Wait, but 1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.0009999, which is less than 0.001, so it's in the interval. So, perhaps n can be as low as 318, but wait, let's check:\n\nWait, 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001, so n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.09886184.\n\nSimilarly, 1/(n\u03c0) must be less than 0.001, so n > 1/(0.001\u03c0)=1000/\u03c0\u2248318.309886184.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184.\n\nTherefore, n can be integers from 319 up to 3183, but when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000099975<0.0001, which is outside the interval. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.000100034>0.0001, which is inside.\n\nSimilarly, the minimum n is 319, because 1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009975<0.001, which is inside.\n\nWait, but 1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009975, which is less than 0.001, so it's in the interval.\n\nWait, but n=318 gives x\u22480.0009999, which is also in the interval. So, why did I think n starts at 319? Because 318.309886184 is approximately 318.31, so the next integer is 319. So, n must be greater than 318.309886184, so n starts at 319.\n\nWait, but 318 is less than 318.309886184, so n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.0009999, which is less than 0.001, so it's in the interval. Wait, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309886184, so n=319 is the smallest integer. So, n=319 is the first n where x=1/(n\u03c0) is less than 0.001, but wait, no: when n increases, x decreases. So, n=319 gives x\u22480.0009975, which is less than 0.001, so it's in the interval. But n=318 gives x\u22480.0009999, which is also less than 0.001, so it's in the interval. So, perhaps my initial calculation was wrong.\n\nWait, let me think again: the condition is 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nSo, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.09886184.\n\nAnd 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n > 1000/\u03c0\u2248318.309886184.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, n can be any integer from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. Because 3183 is less than 3183.09886184, so it's allowed. So, n=319, 320, ..., 3183.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that n=3183 gives x\u22480.000099975, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. But according to the inequality, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so n=3183 is allowed because 3183 < 3183.09886184. So, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000099975, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. Therefore, n=3183 is not allowed. So, the maximum n is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.000100034>0.0001.\n\nTherefore, the number of n is from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nSo, number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 3182 - 319 = 2863 +1=2864.\n\nWait, that's different from before. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let me compute 3182 - 319 +1:\n\n3182 - 319 = 2863\n\n2863 +1=2864\n\nSo, 2864.\n\nBut earlier, when I considered n up to 3183, I got 2865, but that includes n=3183, which gives x outside the interval. So, the correct number should be 2864.\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\nn starts at 319 and ends at 3182.\n\nSo, the number of terms is 3182 - 319 +1.\n\nCompute 3182 - 319:\n\n3182 - 300 = 2882\n\n2882 - 19 = 2863\n\nSo, 2863 +1 =2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I considered 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.09886184, so n=3183 is less than that, so it's allowed, but x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000099975<0.0001, so it's outside. Therefore, n=3183 is excluded, so the maximum n is 3182.\n\nTherefore, the number of n is 3182 - 319 +1=2864.\n\nSo, that's the correct number.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach.\n\nThe interval for x is (0.0001, 0.001). So, 0.0001 < x < 0.001.\n\nWe can write x = 1/(n\u03c0), so substituting:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n <10000/\u03c0\n\nWhich is approximately 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184.\n\nTherefore, n can be any integer from 319 up to 3183.\n\nBut when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000099975<0.0001, so it's excluded.\n\nTherefore, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nThus, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 +1=2864.\n\nWait, but let me compute 3182 - 319:\n\n3182 - 319:\n\n3182 - 300 = 2882\n\n2882 - 19 = 2863\n\nSo, 2863 +1=2864.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but that was a mistake because n=3183 gives x outside the interval, so we have to exclude it, resulting in 2864.\n\nWait, but let me think again: if n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183, that's 3183 - 319 +1=2865 numbers. But since n=3183 gives x outside, we have to subtract 1, so 2865 -1=2864.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the correct number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me think of it another way.\n\nThe interval for x is from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is a span of 0.0009 in x. But since x is varying in the reciprocal space, the number of zeros is determined by how many times 1/x passes through multiples of \u03c0. So, 1/x goes from 1000 to 10000, which is a span of 9000. Each zero occurs every \u03c0 units, so the number of zeros is approximately 9000/\u03c0\u22482866.197. Since we can't have a fraction of a zero, we take the integer part, which is 2866. But since the exact count is 2864, perhaps this approximation is slightly off.\n\nWait, but according to our earlier calculation, it's 2864.\n\nWait, but let me compute 3182 - 319 +1=2864.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, the number of integers between a and b inclusive is floor(b) - ceil(a) +1.\n\nSo, in this case, a=318.309886184, so ceil(a)=319.\n\nb=3183.09886184, so floor(b)=3183.\n\nBut since n=3183 gives x outside the interval, we have to take floor(b)=3182.\n\nWait, no, floor(b)=3183, but since x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, we have to exclude it. So, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nTherefore, number of integers is floor(b)-1 - ceil(a) +1=3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me think of it in terms of the span. The interval for 1/x is from 1000 to 10000, which is 9000. Each zero occurs every \u03c0 units, so the number of zeros is 9000/\u03c0\u22482866.197. But since we can't have a fraction, it's either 2866 or 2867. But according to our calculation, it's 2864. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps the approximation is not accurate because the interval is not inclusive of the endpoints. Let me think: the number of zeros is equal to the number of times 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0 in the interval (1000, 10000). So, the number of zeros is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0) +1.\n\nWait, but in our case, floor(10000/\u03c0)=3183, and ceil(1000/\u03c0)=319.\n\nSo, number of zeros=3183 - 319 +1=2865.\n\nBut as we saw, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000099975<0.0001, which is outside the interval, so we have to subtract 1, giving 2864.\n\nTherefore, the correct number is 2864.\n\nWait, but perhaps the formula is different. The number of zeros is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0). So, 3183 - 319=2864.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with a small example to make sure I'm not making a mistake.\n\nSuppose I have x in (0.001, 0.002). Then, 1/x is in (500, 1000). The number of zeros would be floor(1000/\u03c0) - ceil(500/\u03c0) +1.\n\nCompute 500/\u03c0\u2248159.1549431, so ceil is 160.\n\n1000/\u03c0\u2248318.309886184, so floor is 318.\n\nNumber of zeros=318 -160 +1=159.\n\nBut let me check: the number of n where 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.001, 0.002), which is equivalent to n in (500, 1000)/\u03c0\u2248(159.1549, 318.309886). So, n from 160 to 318 inclusive.\n\nNumber of integers=318 -160 +1=159. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in our original problem, the number of zeros is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0)=3183 -319=2864.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but in the small example, I had (0.001, 0.002), which corresponds to 1/x in (500, 1000). The number of zeros is 159, which is 318 -160 +1=159.\n\nSimilarly, in our problem, 1/x in (1000, 10000), so n from 319 to 3183, but since n=3183 gives x outside, we have to go up to n=3182, so number of zeros=3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier step where I thought n goes up to 3183, which would give 2865, but realized that n=3183 gives x outside, so it's 2864.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where the function crosses the x-axis, i.e., where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\). This occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for some integer \\( n \\), which implies \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n\nWe need \\( x \\) to lie in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\).

    "text": " \n\nNow, the x-values we are interested in are between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, I need to find all integers n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me write that down:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nI can solve for n by taking reciprocals, but I have to remember that taking reciprocals reverses the inequalities. So, let's invert all parts:\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001.\n\nCalculating those values, 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So,\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nNow, I can divide all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nLet me compute these values. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So,\n\n1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184.\n\nSimilarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n can take values from 319 up to 3183. \n\nNow, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers, I can subtract the smaller number from the larger one and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Each of these n values corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). \n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, n starts at 319 because 318.309886184 is just a little over 318, so the next integer is 319. And the upper limit is 3183.09886184, so the largest integer less than that is 3183. So, yes, from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nJust to double-check, let me compute 3183 - 319 + 1 again. 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865.

    "text": " So, the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer values of n. \n\nNow, I need to find all such x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, I can set up the inequality 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me write that down:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nI can solve this inequality for n to find the range of integers n that satisfy it. Let me first solve the left part of the inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that flipping the inequality when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive, I get:\n\n1/0.0001 > n\u03c0\n\nWhich simplifies to 10000 > n\u03c0. Then, dividing both sides by \u03c0, I get n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating that, \u03c0 is approximately 3.1416, so 10000 divided by 3.1416 is roughly 3183.098. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.098.\n\nNow, solving the right part of the inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0, which is 1000 < n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, I get n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that, 1000 divided by 3.1416 is approximately 318.309. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309.\n\nSince n has to be an integer, n must satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Wait, but hold on, 3183.098 is the upper bound, so n can be up to 3183 because n has to be less than that. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive.\n\nNow, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1. Wait, actually, let me think about it. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 3183 - 319. Let me subtract 300 from 3183 to get 2883, then subtract 19 more to get 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there should be 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Because sometimes when dealing with inequalities, especially with reciprocals, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me verify the calculations step by step.\n\nStarting with the inequality:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nTaking reciprocals (and flipping inequalities):\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing each part by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nWhich is approximately:\n\n318.309 < n < 3183.098\n\nSince n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again to be sure.\n\n3183 minus 319: Let's do 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to check is to compute 3183 - 319 = 2864, then adding 1 gives 2865. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when n is 319, x is 1/(319\u03c0), which is approximately 1/(319*3.1416) \u2248 1/1003. So, 1/1003 is approximately 0.000997, which is just above 0.0001. Wait, no, 0.0001 is 10^{-4}, which is 0.0001, and 0.001 is 10^{-3}. So, 1/(319\u03c0) is approximately 1/(1003) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Similarly, when n is 3183, x is 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000), which is 0.0001, but since the interval is open at 0.0001, we need to check if 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0): 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.0001, we have to make sure that x is greater than 0.0001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, since 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since the interval is open, we need to check if 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Wait, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 exactly, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which doesn't include 0.0001, so x must be greater than 0.0001. Therefore, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded. So, does that mean n can only go up to 3182?\n\nWait, that's a critical point. Let me clarify: if n = 3183, then x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is exactly the lower bound of the interval, but the interval is open at 0.0001, so x must be greater than 0.0001. Therefore, n must satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which is n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than 3183.098, meaning the maximum integer n is 3183. But wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, so it's not greater than 0.0001, it's equal. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded. So, does that mean that n can only go up to 3182?\n\nWait, let's compute 1/(3182\u03c0). 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77, 182\u03c0 \u2248 571.88, so total \u2248 9424.77 + 571.88 \u2248 10, 9424.77 + 571.88 = 9996.65. So, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9996.65, so 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.65 \u2248 0.0001000335, which is just above 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000335, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. Therefore, n can be up to 3183, but wait, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is not included, so n can only go up to 3182.\n\nWait, so this changes the upper limit. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001 exactly, which is excluded. So, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nSimilarly, when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3182.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 +1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 gives 2864. So, there are 2864 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n went up to 3183, but now I see that n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so n must go up to 3182. So, the correct number is 2864.\n\nWait, let me confirm this again. Let's compute 1/(3183\u03c0) = 1/(3183 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1415926535). Let me compute 3183 * 3.1415926535.\n\nFirst, compute 3000 * 3.1415926535 = 9424.7779605.\n\nThen, 183 * 3.1415926535: Let's compute 100 * 3.1415926535 = 314.15926535.\n\n80 * 3.1415926535 = 251.32741228.\n\n3 * 3.1415926535 = 9.4247779605.\n\nAdding those together: 314.15926535 + 251.32741228 = 565.48667763 + 9.4247779605 \u2248 574.91145559.\n\nSo, total 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.7779605 + 574.91145559 \u2248 9999.68941609.\n\nSo, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.68941609 \u2248 0.0001000031, which is just over 0.0001. Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000031, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but I thought 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000, but it's actually slightly less, 9999.689, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000031, which is just over 0.0001. Therefore, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), so n can be 3183.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000, but it's actually 9999.689, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000031, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. Therefore, n can be up to 3183.\n\nWait, but let me check with n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001000031, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, n can go up to 3183.\n\nSimilarly, for n=3184: x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22481/(3184*3.1415926535). Let's compute 3184*3.1415926535. 3000*\u03c0\u22489424.7779605, 184*\u03c0\u2248577.5398258. So total\u22489424.7779605+577.5398258\u224810002.3177863. So, 1/(3184\u03c0)\u22481/10002.3177863\u22480.000099976, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, n=3184 gives x\u22480.000099976, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3183.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 3183\u03c0\u22489999.689, so 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001000031, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. So, n can be up to 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that 3183\u03c0\u224810000, but it's actually slightly less, so 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001000031, which is just above 0.0001, so included. Therefore, n can be up to 3183, so the count is 3183 - 319 +1=2865.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought 3183\u03c0\u224810000, I thought that 1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001, but actually, 3183\u03c0\u22489999.689, so 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001000031, which is just above 0.0001, so included. Therefore, n=3183 is valid.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check with n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22481/(1003)\u22480.000997, which is less than 0.001, so included. And n=3183: x\u22480.0001000031, which is just above 0.0001, so included. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 +1=2865.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that 3183\u03c0\u224810000, but it's actually 3183\u03c0\u22489999.689, so 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001000031, which is just above 0.0001, so included. Therefore, the count is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought that n=3183 gives x=0.0001 exactly, but it's actually just over 0.0001, so included. Therefore, the count is 2865.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me think about the endpoints. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so open at both ends. So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001.\n\nSo, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 10000/\u03c0 \u22483183.098, so n can be up to 3183, since 3183 < 3183.098.\n\nSimilarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248318.309, so n starts at 319.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 +1=2865.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer n. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, resulting in 2865 x-intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

    "text": " \n\nWait, so the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for each integer n. Now, I need to find how many such x's lie within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Let me write that down: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, I can solve this inequality for n to find the range of integers that satisfy it. \n\nLet me start by solving the left part of the inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that reversing the inequality when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive, I get 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Calculating 1/0.0001 gives me 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, which is approximately 3.14159, I get n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000/3.14159 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.098. Since n is an integer, the maximum n can be is 3183.\n\nNow, let's solve the right part of the inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, which reverses the inequality, gives me n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000/3.14159 \u2248 318.309. Since n must be an integer, the smallest n can be is 319 because 318.309 is just a bit more than 318, so the next integer is 319.\n\nSo, putting it all together, n must satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is given by b - a + 1. So, substituting the values, it's 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that calculation to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 3183 minus 319: Let's do it step by step. 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct. So, there are 2865 integers n such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Each of these n's corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nWait, but let me confirm that each x = 1/(n\u03c0) indeed lies within (0.0001, 0.001). For n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.1) \u2248 0.000996, which is just under 0.001, so that's within the interval. For n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, but since the interval is open at 0.0001, does that mean we exclude it? Wait, hold on. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so it doesn't include 0.0001 or 0.001. So, we need to check whether x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0): 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159 \u2248 10000.0, so 1/10000 is 0.0001 exactly. But since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001. So, x = 0.0001 is excluded, which would correspond to n = 3183, because 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. So, n = 3183 would give x = 0.0001, which is not included in the interval. So, the upper bound for n is actually 3182 instead of 3183. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought n goes up to 3183 because 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n must be less than that, meaning n can be 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, n can go up to 3182. Let me check: 1/(3182\u03c0) is approximately 1/(3182 * 3.14159) \u2248 1/(10000 - something), so it would be slightly more than 0.0001, which is within the interval. So, n can be up to 3182. \n\nSimilarly, for the lower bound, n starts at 319. Let me check n = 319: 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.1) \u2248 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, the range of n is from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Now, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 is 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, there are 2864 x-intercepts in that interval. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought 3183 - 319 +1 was 2865, but now considering that n can't be 3183, it's 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864. So, which one is correct? Let me check again. The original inequality was 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. \n\nSo, solving 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 gives n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is not included because the interval is open. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but since 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is not in the interval, we have to take n up to 3182. \n\nSimilarly, for the lower bound: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 gives n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. \n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. The number of integers from 319 to 3182 is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3182 - 319 is 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. \n\nWait, but earlier when I took n from 319 to 3183, I got 2865, but upon realizing that n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, the correct count is 2864. So, I think 2864 is the correct number. \n\nLet me just confirm with a small example to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Suppose I have an interval (a, b), and I want to find integers n such that c < n < d. The number of integers would be floor(d - 1) - ceil(c + 1) + 1, or something like that. Wait, maybe it's better to think of it as the number of integers between m and n inclusive is n - m + 1. So, if m = 319 and n = 3182, then the count is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the number of terms in the sequence 319, 320, ..., 3182. The number of terms is (3182 - 319) + 1 = 2864. So, that seems consistent. \n\nAnother way to check is to calculate how many terms there are between 1 and 3182, which is 3182 terms, and subtract the number of terms before 319, which is 318 terms (from 1 to 318). So, 3182 - 318 = 2864. That matches as well. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct number of x-intercepts is 2864. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial steps. So, the function is y = sin(1/x). The x-intercepts occur where sin(1/x) = 0, which implies 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing by \u03c0, we get 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating those: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be integers greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098. Therefore, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. But since x must be greater than 0.0001, which is 1/(3183\u03c0), we have to exclude n=3183 because x=1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001 is not included. So, n goes up to 3182. \n\nThus, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought 3183 - 319 + 1 is 2865, but since n can't be 3183, it's 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864. So, 2864 is the correct count. \n\nI think that's solid. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3182. The number of integers in this range is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\n$\\boxed{2864}$"

Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), I can substitute this into the inequality to find the range of n. Let me do that step by step.\n\nFirst, substitute x = 1/(n\u03c0) into 0.0001 < x < 0.001. That gives me 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Now, I can rewrite this inequality to solve for n. Let's take the reciprocal of all parts, remembering that reversing the inequality signs when taking reciprocals. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those reciprocals: 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. \n\nNext, I can divide all parts of the inequality by \u03c0 to solve for n. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute those values numerically. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535.

Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nSince n has to be an integer, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. So, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nTo find the number of integers between two numbers, I can subtract the smaller number from the larger one and add 1. So, the number of integers n is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n in this range.\n\nWait, but I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me verify the reciprocals again. The original interval is 0.0001 < x < 0.001. So, x is between 1/10000 and 1/1000. Therefore, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. Since 1/x = n\u03c0, n must be between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.31 and 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. \n\nCalculating the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive: 3183 - 319 = 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nI think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, let me consider whether all these x-values lie strictly within (0.0001, 0.001). Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), and n ranges from 319 to 3183, the smallest x is 1/(3183\u03c0) and the largest x is 1/(319\u03c0). Let me compute these to ensure they are within the interval.\n\nCalculating 1/(319\u03c0): 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 1003. So, 1/(1003) \u2248 0.000997, which is approximately 0.001. Wait, but 0.000997 is just slightly less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Similarly, 1/(3183\u03c0): 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 10000. So, 1/10000 is 0.0001, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, which is the lower bound. So, both endpoints are included in the interval, but the interval is open, meaning it doesn't include 0.0001 and 0.001. Hmm, so does that mean we have to exclude n = 319 and n = 3183?\n\nWait, let me think. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, x = 1/(n\u03c0) must satisfy 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. Therefore, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so n can be up to 3183. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, so n starts at 319. \n\nBut wait, when n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. When n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so x = 0.0001 is excluded. Therefore, n can be up to 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, which is excluded. So, does that mean n should go up to 3182? Wait, no, because 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but let me compute it more accurately.\n\nLet me compute 3183 * \u03c0: 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute this precisely. 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796. 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 574.595. So, total is approximately 9424.77796 + 574.595 \u2248 9999.373. So, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 9999.373, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.373 \u2248 0.000100006. Wait, that's actually slightly greater than 0.0001. Wait, no, 1/9999.373 is approximately 0.000100006, which is 1.00006e-4, which is just a bit more than 0.0001 (which is 1e-4). So, 0.000100006 is greater than 0.0001, so x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is just barely greater than 0.0001, so it is included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, when n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1003 \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Therefore, both n = 319 and n = 3183 are valid because their corresponding x-values lie within the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nWait, but earlier I thought 1/(3183\u03c0) was approximately 0.0001, but more accurately, it's about 0.000100006, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included. So, n can be from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscalculate 3183 - 319. Let's compute that: 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then minus 19 more is 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865. So, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that for each n from 319 to 3183, we get a unique x-intercept in the interval. So, the total number is 2865.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 2865 x-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. For x in (0.0001, 0.001), we find n ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 intercepts.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

    "text": " \n\nNow, the interval I'm looking at is from 0.0001 to 0.001. Let me write that down as (0.0001, 0.001). Since x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, 1/x will be between 1000 and 10000. So, 1/x is in (1000, 10000). Therefore, n\u03c0 must lie between 1000 and 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. \n\nTo find the integer values of n, I can divide the bounds by \u03c0. Let me calculate that. So, the lower bound is 1000/\u03c0 and the upper bound is 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values. \n\nI know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 1000 / 3.1415926535. Let me compute that. \n\n1000 \u00f7 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. \n\nSimilarly, 10000 \u00f7 \u03c0 is 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, n must be an integer such that 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184. \n\nSince n has to be an integer, the smallest integer greater than 318.309886184 is 319, and the largest integer less than 3183.09886184 is 3183. \n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1. Wait, no, actually, if I have a range from a to b inclusive, the number of integers is b - a + 1. \n\nWait, but in this case, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that. \n\n3183 minus 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, starting from n=319, each n gives a distinct x-intercept at x=1/(n\u03c0). Since each n corresponds to a unique x in the interval, and n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, the count is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. \n\nLet me compute 3183 - 319. 3183 minus 300 is 2883, minus 19 more is 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, yes, that seems correct. \n\nI should also make sure that each of these x-values is indeed within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), and n is from 319 to 3183, the smallest x is 1/(3183\u03c0) and the largest x is 1/(319\u03c0). Let me compute these to confirm. \n\nFirst, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(319 * 3.1415926535). Let's compute 319 * 3.1415926535. \n\n319 * 3 is 957, 319 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 319 * 0.1416 \u2248 319 * 0.1 is 31.9, 319 * 0.0416 \u2248 13.3184. So, total \u2248 31.9 + 13.3184 \u2248 45.2184. So, 319\u03c0 \u2248 957 + 45.2184 \u2248 1002.2184. Therefore, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.2184 \u2248 0.0009977. \n\nSimilarly, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1415926535). Let's compute 3183 * 3.1415926535. \n\n3183 * 3 is 9549, 3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.0415926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, and 3183 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 approximately 5.07. So, total \u2248 318.3 + 127.32 + 5.07 \u2248 450.69. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9549 + 450.69 \u2248 10,000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10000 = 0.0001. \n\nWait, that's interesting. So, 1/(319\u03c0) is approximately 0.0009977, which is just under 0.001, and 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001. So, the x-values corresponding to n=319 is just under 0.001, and n=3183 is just over 0.0001. \n\nWait, but our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, meaning it doesn't include the endpoints. So, we need to check if x=1/(319\u03c0) is less than 0.001 and x=1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. \n\nFrom the approximation, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009977, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval. Similarly, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is equal to the lower bound, but since the interval is open, we don't include 0.0001. So, we need to check if n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) which is just above 0.0001. Wait, actually, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but let me compute it more accurately. \n\nLet me compute 3183 * \u03c0: \n\n3183 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute 3000\u03c0 = 9424.77796, 183\u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 183*3=549, 183*0.1415926535\u224825.96. So, total \u2248 549 + 25.96 \u2248 574.96. So, total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796 + 574.96 \u2248 10,000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. \n\nBut since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but since it's open, we don't include it. Therefore, the smallest n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. \n\nSo, let's find the smallest integer n such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. \n\nThat is, n < 1/(0.0001 * \u03c0) = 1/(0.0001 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(0.00031415926535) \u2248 3183.09886184. \n\nWait, so n must be less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n is an integer, the largest integer n such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3183, because 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since it's open, we have to make sure that x=1/(n\u03c0) is strictly greater than 0.0001. \n\nWait, maybe I should solve for n such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. \n\nSo, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n\u03c0 < 10000 => n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, the largest integer n is 3183, but we need to check if 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. \n\nWait, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but is it slightly more or less? Let me compute 3183\u03c0 with more precision. \n\nLet me compute 3183 * \u03c0. \n\n\u03c0 \u2248 3.141592653589793. \n\nSo, 3183 * 3.141592653589793. \n\nLet me compute 3000\u03c0 = 9424.77796077, 183\u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.141592653589793 \u2248 574.9556843. \n\nAdding them together: 9424.77796077 + 574.9556843 \u2248 10,000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000. Therefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. \n\nBut since 3183\u03c0 is slightly less than 10,000, because 3183 * \u03c0 is approximately 10,000, but let's see: \n\nWait, 3183 * \u03c0 = 3183 * 3.141592653589793. \n\nLet me compute 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.141592653589793 \u2248 3183 * 0.141592653589793. \n\nCompute 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.041592653589793 \u2248 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, 3183 * 0.001592653589793 \u2248 approximately 5.07. So, total \u2248 318.3 + 127.32 + 5.07 \u2248 450.69. \n\nSo, total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9549 + 450.69 \u2248 10,000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. \n\nBut since 3183\u03c0 is slightly less than 10,000, because 3183\u03c0 is exactly 10,000 only if \u03c0 is exactly 10,000/3183, which it's not. So, actually, 3183\u03c0 is slightly less than 10,000, making 1/(3183\u03c0) slightly greater than 0.0001. \n\nWait, let me think: if 3183\u03c0 = 10,000, then 1/(3183\u03c0) = 0.0001. But since \u03c0 is slightly more than 3.1415926535, 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10,000, making 1/(3183\u03c0) slightly less than 0.0001. Wait, no, actually, if \u03c0 is slightly more, then 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001. \n\nWait, let me clarify: \n\nIf we have n\u03c0 = 10,000, then x = 1/(10,000) = 0.0001. \n\nBut since n is 3183, and 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10,000, because \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 3183 * \u03c0 is 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 10,000.000...something? Wait, no, let me compute more accurately. \n\nWait, 3183 * \u03c0: \n\nLet me compute 3183 * 3.141592653589793. \n\n3183 * 3 = 9549. \n\n3183 * 0.141592653589793: \n\nLet me compute 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3 \n\n3183 * 0.041592653589793: \n\nFirst, 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32 \n\n3183 * 0.001592653589793 \u2248 3183 * 0.0015 \u2248 4.7745 \n\nSo, adding up: 318.3 + 127.32 + 4.7745 \u2248 450.3945 \n\nSo, total \u03c0 * 3183 \u2248 9549 + 450.3945 \u2248 10,000 - wait, 9549 + 450.3945 is 9999.3945. \n\nSo, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.3945, which is less than 10,000. Therefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.3945 \u2248 0.000100006. \n\nWait, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100006, which is just slightly above 0.0001. Therefore, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.000100006, which is greater than 0.0001, so it is included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nSimilarly, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009977, which is less than 0.001, so it's included as well. \n\nTherefore, the values of n from 319 to 3183 inclusive correspond to x in (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 + 1. \n\nLet me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 gives 2865. \n\nTherefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the subtraction: 3183 - 319. \n\n3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. Yep, that's correct. \n\nSo, I think that's the answer. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine when \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\). This occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for some integer \\( n \\), which implies \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n\nGiven the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need \\( x \\) to satisfy:\n\\[ 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\]\n\nThis translates to:\n\\[ 1000 < n\\pi < 10000 \\]\n\nDividing by \\( \\pi \\) (approximately 3.1415926535), we get:\n\\[ \\frac{1000}{\\pi} \\approx 318.31 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{10000}{\\pi} \\approx 3183.09886184 \\]\n\nThus, \\( n \\) must be an integer such that:\n\\[ 318.31 < n < 3183.09886184 \\]\n\nThe smallest integer \\( n \\) is 319 and the largest integer \\( n \\) is 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is:\n\\[ 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is \\(\\boxed{2865}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nWait, so for each integer n, there's an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). But I need to find how many such x's lie within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, I should find all integers n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me write that down:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nI can rewrite these inequalities to solve for n. Let's take the left inequality first:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0)\n\nMultiplying both sides by n\u03c0 (since n is positive, because x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which are positive, so n must be positive as well), we get:\n\n0.0001 * n\u03c0 < 1\n\nThen, dividing both sides by 0.0001\u03c0:\n\nn < 1 / (0.0001\u03c0)\n\nCalculating that, 1 / 0.0001 is 10000, so n < 10000 / \u03c0. Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1416, so 10000 / 3.1416 \u2248 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n can be at most 3183.\n\nNow, the right inequality:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nMultiplying both sides by n\u03c0:\n\n1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0\n\nDividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0:\n\n1 / (0.001\u03c0) < n\n\nCalculating that, 1 / 0.001 is 1000, so 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.309. Since n must be an integer, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n can be is 319.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. To find the number of integers from a to b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. But here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I set up the inequalities correctly, right? 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Then, solving for n, I correctly inverted the inequalities when taking reciprocals, remembering that flipping inequalities when taking reciprocals reverses the inequality signs. Wait, actually, when I have 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0), taking reciprocals would give n\u03c0 < 10000, but since both sides are positive, the inequality sign remains the same when taking reciprocals? Wait no, actually, when you take reciprocals, the inequality reverses. So, if a < b and a and b are positive, then 1/a > 1/b. So, I think I might have made a mistake in the direction of the inequality when solving for n.\n\nLet me go back. Starting with 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Taking reciprocals, since both sides are positive, we get 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0, which is 10000 > n\u03c0. Then, dividing both sides by \u03c0, we get n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, which is correct as before. Similarly, for the right inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals, since both sides are positive, we get n\u03c0 > 1000. Then, dividing by \u03c0, we get n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n \u2265 319, which is correct.\n\nSo, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. Now, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that 1/(319\u03c0) is indeed greater than 0.001. Let me compute 1/(319 * \u03c0). 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 319 * 3.1416. Let me compute 300 * 3.1416 = 942.48, and 19 * 3.1416 \u2248 59.6904, so total \u2248 942.48 + 59.6904 \u2248 1002.1704. So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.1704 \u2248 0.000998, which is just under 0.001. Wait, but 0.000998 is less than 0.001, so 1/(319\u03c0) is approximately 0.000998, which is less than 0.001, so that would mean that n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.000998, which is just below 0.001, so it's within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but 0.000998 is less than 0.001, so it is included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), so n=319 is valid.\n\nSimilarly, for n=3183, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound of the interval. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, does that mean x=0.0001 is excluded? So, we need to check whether 1/(n\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001, not just equal to it.\n\nWait, so 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183. But 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but we need to check if 1/(3183\u03c0) is indeed greater than 0.0001.\n\nWait, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but is it greater than 0.0001? Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 exactly. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded. So, the largest n such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3183, but wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, so it's not greater, it's equal. Therefore, the largest n such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) would be slightly larger than 0.0001.\n\nWait, this is a crucial point. Let me check it again. So, if n=3183, then 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 exactly. Since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, we need x > 0.0001 and x < 0.001. Therefore, 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, for n=3183, 1/(3183\u03c0) = 0.0001 exactly, which is not included in the interval. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but since 3183\u03c0 = 10000 approximately, 1/(3183\u03c0) = 0.0001 exactly, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) would be slightly larger than 0.0001.\n\nSimilarly, let's check n=3182: 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 3182 * 3 = 9546, 3182 * 0.1416 \u2248 3182 * 0.1 = 318.2, 3182 * 0.0416 \u2248 132. So total \u2248 9546 + 318.2 + 132 \u2248 9546 + 450.2 \u2248 9996.2. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.2 \u2248 0.00010004, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval.\n\nSimilarly, n=319: 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 1002.17, so 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000998, which is just under 0.001, so it's included in the interval.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n=319 was valid, but now I'm questioning whether n=3183 is valid. So, if n=3183 gives x=0.0001 exactly, which is excluded, so the maximum n is 3182.\n\nWait, so let me recast the inequalities correctly:\n\nWe have 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nWhich translates to:\n\n1/(0.001) < n\u03c0 < 1/(0.0001)\n\nSo, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098\n\nSince n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. But wait, when n=3183, 1/(n\u03c0) = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded because the interval is open at 0.0001. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is not included. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nWait, but earlier when I calculated n=3182, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010004, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included. So, n can go up to 3182.\n\nWait, but let's check n=3183: 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but since it's open, it's excluded. So, the maximum n is 3182. Therefore, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me recast it:\n\nThe lower bound: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098 \u21d2 n \u2264 3183. But since 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nSimilarly, the upper bound: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u21d2 n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 \u21d2 n \u2265 319.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nNow, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3182 - 319 + 1 = 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, where did I go wrong? Let me check the initial calculation again.\n\nInitially, I thought n goes from 319 to 3183, which would be 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. But upon realizing that n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so n should go up to 3182, giving 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nSo, the correct number should be 2864.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with specific numbers. Let me take n=319: 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000998, which is within (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nn=3182: 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010004, which is just above 0.0001, so included.\n\nn=3183: 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 exactly, which is excluded.\n\nSo, n starts at 319 and ends at 3182, inclusive. So, number of terms is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 2864.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that 3182 - 319 is indeed 2863, and adding 1 gives 2864.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the number of integers between a and b exclusive is floor(b) - ceil(a) + 1, but I need to be careful with open intervals.\n\nWait, but in this case, the interval for x is (0.0001, 0.001), which corresponds to 1/(n\u03c0) being in that interval, so n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which translates to 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.309 < n < 3183.098.\n\nSo, n can be 319, 320, ..., 3183. But wait, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so n can go up to 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, n must be up to 3182.\n\nWait, but 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, which is the lower bound, so it's excluded. Therefore, n can be up to 3182.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with n=3182: 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000 - let me compute more accurately. Let's compute 3182 * \u03c0:\n\n3182 * 3 = 9546\n\n3182 * 0.1416 \u2248 3182 * 0.1 = 318.2\n\n3182 * 0.0416 \u2248 132.0\n\nAdding up: 318.2 + 132.0 \u2248 450.2\n\nSo, total is approximately 9546 + 450.2 \u2248 9996.2\n\nThus, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.2 \u2248 0.00010004, which is just above 0.0001, so included.\n\nSimilarly, n=3183: 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.1416 \u2248 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.0416 \u2248 132.3, so total \u2248 9549 + 318.3 + 132.3 \u2248 9549 + 450.6 \u2248 9999.6\n\nSo, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.6 \u2248 0.000100004, which is just over 0.0001. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier assumption. Wait, if 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.6, then 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100004, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, perhaps I was wrong earlier when I thought that n=3183 gives exactly 0.0001. It actually gives slightly more than 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nWait, let me compute 3183 * \u03c0 more accurately. Let's use \u03c0 \u2248 3.1415926535.\n\nSo, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535.\n\nLet me compute this step by step:\n\n3183 * 3 = 9549\n\n3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3\n\n3183 * 0.0415926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, and 3183 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 approx 5.06.\n\nSo, total \u2248 318.3 + 127.32 + 5.06 \u2248 450.68\n\nSo, total 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 9549 + 450.68 \u2248 9999.68\n\nSo, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.68 \u2248 0.000100003, which is just over 0.0001, so included in the interval.\n\nTherefore, n=3183 is valid because 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100003 > 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nWait, but then earlier I thought 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 exactly, but it's actually slightly more. So, n=3183 is valid.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, so this contradicts my earlier conclusion. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let's check n=3183: 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100003, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 is valid.\n\nSimilarly, n=319: 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000998, which is less than 0.001, so included.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, so the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that 1/(3183\u03c0) was exactly 0.0001, but with more accurate calculation, it's slightly over. So, n=3183 is valid.\n\nTherefore, the correct number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check n=3183 again. 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 9999.68, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100003, which is indeed greater than 0.0001, so included.\n\nSimilarly, n=3184: 3184 * \u03c0 \u2248 3184 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3184 * 3 = 9552, 3184 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3184 * 0.1 = 318.4, 3184 * 0.0415926535 \u2248 approx 132.4, so total \u2248 9552 + 318.4 + 132.4 \u2248 9552 + 450.8 \u2248 9999.2\n\nWait, that can't be right because 3184 * \u03c0 should be slightly more than 3183 * \u03c0. Wait, maybe my approximation is off. Let me compute more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute 1/(n\u03c0) for n=3183 and n=3184 to see where they fall.\n\nFor n=3183: 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183*3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(9999.68) \u2248 0.000100003\n\nFor n=3184: 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3184*3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10002.56) \u2248 0.000099975, which is less than 0.0001, so excluded.\n\nWait, so n=3184 gives x\u22480.000099975, which is less than 0.0001, so excluded. Therefore, n=3184 is too big, so the maximum n is 3183.\n\nSo, n=3183 is valid, n=3184 is invalid.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 exactly, but it's actually approximately 0.000100003, which is just over 0.0001, so included.\n\nTherefore, the correct number is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another approach. The number of zeros of sin(1/x) between x=a and x=b is equal to the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is between a and b. So, in this case, a=0.0001 and b=0.001.\n\nSo, the number of n's is the number of integers n satisfying 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nWhich is equivalent to n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098 and n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309.\n\nSo, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183, inclusive.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think earlier confusion came from miscalculating whether n=3183 was included or not, but upon more accurate calculation, n=3183 gives x\u22480.000100003, which is included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

    "text": " \n\nWait, so for each integer n, there's an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). Now, I need to find all such x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, I can set up inequalities: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me write that down:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nI can solve for n here. Let me take the reciprocal of all parts, remembering that flipping inequalities reverses them because all terms are positive. So:\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001.\n\nCalculating the reciprocals, 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nNow, to solve for n, I can divide all parts by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nLet me compute these values numerically. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319, and the largest possible n is 3183.\n\nNow, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, let me check: the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Therefore, there should be 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, first, the reciprocal of 0.0001 is 10000, and the reciprocal of 0.001 is 1000. So, the inequality 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000 is correct. Then, dividing by \u03c0 gives 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Now, the count is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 minus 300 is 2883, minus 19 is 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 is 2865. That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I take n starting at 319, does that correspond to x = 1/(319\u03c0) being greater than 0.0001? Let me check: 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(319 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(1002.6) \u2248 0.000997, which is just under 0.001, right? Wait, 0.000997 is 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so that's okay because the interval is up to 0.001, but not including 0.001. Wait, so 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000997, which is greater than 0.0001, so that's within the interval. Similarly, the largest n is 3183, so x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), does x = 0.0001 count? No, because it's an open interval, so x must be greater than 0.0001. Therefore, I need to check if 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001.\n\nWait, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001. So, it's exactly 0.0001. But the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, x = 0.0001 is not included, so n = 3183 would give x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded. So, does that mean n should go up to 3182 instead?\n\nWait, hold on, let me recalculate. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n\u03c0 < 10000, so n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886. So, n must be less than 3183.09886, meaning the maximum integer n is 3183. But when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound of the interval, but since the interval is open at 0.0001, this x is not included. So, perhaps the maximum n is 3182, so that x = 1/(3182\u03c0) is just above 0.0001.\n\nWait, let me compute 1/(3182\u03c0). 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 3182 * 3 = 9546, 3182 * 0.1416 \u2248 3182 * 0.1 = 318.2, 3182 * 0.04 = 127.28, 3182 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0912. Adding those up: 9546 + 318.2 = 9864.2 + 127.28 = 9991.48 + 5.0912 \u2248 9996.5712. So, 1/9996.5712 \u2248 0.000100035, which is just a bit above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n can go up to 3183, but when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is not included. So, n must be up to 3182 to have x just above 0.0001.\n\nWait, but let's check n = 3183: 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.1416 \u2248 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, 3183 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0928. Adding those: 9549 + 318.3 = 9867.3 + 127.32 = 9994.62 + 5.0928 \u2248 9999.7128. So, 1/9999.7128 \u2248 0.0001000028, which is just above 0.0001, so x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000028, which is greater than 0.0001, so it is included in the interval. Wait, but 0.0001 is excluded, but 0.0001000028 is included. So, n = 3183 is acceptable.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but actually, it's a bit more. So, n can go up to 3183, because x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000028, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the maximum n is 3183.\n\nSimilarly, let's check the lower end: n starts at 319. So, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.6) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval. Therefore, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183, inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n in that range, which would correspond to 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when n increases by 1, x decreases by a certain amount. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept, right? Because each n gives a distinct x = 1/(n\u03c0), and all these x's are within the interval. So, each n in 319 to 3183 gives exactly one x-intercept.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check the count once more. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319, b is 3183. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 is 2865. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the number of terms in the arithmetic sequence starting at 319 and ending at 3183 with a common difference of 1. The formula for the number of terms is ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1, which gives ((3183 - 319)/1) + 1 = 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, that's consistent.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to make sure my counting is correct. Suppose I have n from 2 to 5 inclusive. The numbers are 2,3,4,5. So, 5 - 2 = 3, then +1 is 4 numbers. That works. Similarly, from 1 to 3: 3 -1 = 2, +1 = 3. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, I think my answer is 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial setup. The function is y = sin(1/x). The zeros occur at 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). Then, we need x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Then, n must be integer values from ceiling(1000/\u03c0) to floor(10000/\u03c0). Let me compute ceiling(1000/\u03c0) and floor(10000/\u03c0).\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so the ceiling is 319. 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so the floor is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which gives 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes when dealing with inequalities, especially with reciprocals, it's easy to flip the inequality signs incorrectly, but in this case, since all values are positive, the inequalities remain consistent when taking reciprocals.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me test with n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.6) \u2248 0.000997, which is indeed greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. Similarly, n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000028, which is just above 0.0001, so included. So, both ends are included, so the count is correct.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

    "text": " \n\nWait, so x is equal to 1 over n times \u03c0. So, for each integer n, there's an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). Now, I need to find how many such x's lie within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, I should find all integers n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. \n\nLet me write that inequality down: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. To find the range of n, I can take reciprocals on all sides, but I have to remember that taking reciprocals reverses the inequalities. So, if I take reciprocals, the inequality becomes 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those, 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10,000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10,000. \n\nNow, to solve for n, I can divide all parts of the inequality by \u03c0. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10,000/\u03c0. Let me calculate those values. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535. Let me compute that: 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10,000 / \u03c0 is 10,000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. \n\nSo, n must be an integer such that 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n can take values starting from the next integer after 318.309886184, which is 319, up to the integer just below 3183.09886184, which is 3183. \n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I got the inequalities right. When I took reciprocals, I flipped the inequalities, right? So, starting from 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, taking reciprocals gives 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10,000. So, dividing by \u03c0, I get 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31 < n < 10,000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. \n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.31 and less than 3183.098. Since n is an integer, the smallest possible n is 319, and the largest possible n is 3183. Now, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then add 1 to include both endpoints. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me think: the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. \n\nWait, that seems like a lot of x-intercepts. Let me verify that. So, the interval is from x = 0.0001 to x = 0.001, which is a very small interval near zero. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly as x approaches zero because 1/x becomes very large. So, as x gets closer to zero, the function oscillates infinitely many times, but in our case, we're looking at a specific interval where x is between 0.0001 and 0.001. \n\nWait, but according to my calculation, n ranges from 319 to 3183, which gives 2865 x-intercepts. That seems plausible because as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x decreases from 10,000 to 1000, so the function sin(1/x) completes 10,000/(2\u03c0) cycles down to 1000/(2\u03c0) cycles. The number of zeros would be roughly the number of times sin(1/x) crosses the x-axis, which is twice per period, so approximately 2*(10,000/(2\u03c0) - 1000/(2\u03c0)) = (10,000 - 1000)/\u03c0 = 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866. But my earlier count was 2865, which is close but off by one. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the exact count.\n\nWait, let me check the calculation again. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that step by step: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. But according to the approximation, it should be about 2866. So, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere. Let me double-check the initial inequalities.\n\nStarting again: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, taking reciprocals, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10,000. Dividing by \u03c0, we get 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 < n < 10,000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184. Since n is an integer, the smallest n is 319 and the largest is 3183. \n\nNow, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that again: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, that's correct. But in my approximation earlier, I thought it should be around 2866. Maybe the difference is because I approximated \u03c0 as 3.14159, but perhaps using more precise values would bring it closer. Alternatively, maybe the exact count is 2865, and the approximation was slightly off. \n\nWait, let me check the number of zeros more carefully. The function sin(1/x) has a zero at each x = 1/(n\u03c0), so for each integer n, we get a zero. The interval for x is (0.0001, 0.001), which corresponds to 1/x being between 1000 and 10,000. So, the values of n are such that 1/(n\u03c0) is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which translates to n being between 1000/\u03c0 and 10,000/\u03c0. \n\nSo, n starts at the smallest integer greater than 1000/\u03c0, which is 319, and ends at the largest integer less than 10,000/\u03c0, which is 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. \n\nWait, but when I approximate the number of zeros, I thought it would be roughly (10,000 - 1000)/\u03c0, which is 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866. So, why is there a discrepancy of one? Maybe because the endpoints are exclusive or inclusive. Let me check: the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001, but the zeros occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, we need to ensure that 1/(n\u03c0) is strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. \n\nSo, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 10,000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so n can be up to 3183. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so n starts at 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. \n\nWait, but in my approximation, I considered the number of periods between 1000 and 10,000, which is (10,000 - 1000)/(2\u03c0) periods, and each period has two zeros, so total zeros would be approximately 2*(9000)/(2\u03c0) = 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866. So, why is there a difference of one? It might be because the exact count is 2865, and the approximation rounds to 2866, but since we're dealing with integers, it's possible that the exact count is one less. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me check: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. That seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. \n\nWait, but let me think again: as x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so the function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is from 10^{-4} to 10^{-3}, 1/x goes from 10^4 to 10^3. So, the number of oscillations is (10^4 - 10^3)/(2\u03c0) = 9000/(2\u03c0) \u2248 1432.396. Each oscillation has two zeros, so total zeros would be approximately 2*1432.396 \u2248 2864.792, which is approximately 2865. So, that matches the exact count. \n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. \n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't include any endpoints that shouldn't be included. Since the interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), we don't include x = 0.0001 or x = 0.001. So, we need to check if x = 1/(n\u03c0) is strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. \n\nFor the lower bound: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 10,000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so the maximum integer n is 3183. For the upper bound: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so the minimum integer n is 319. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 2865 integers. \n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check for n=319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.25) \u2248 0.0009967, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. For n=3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10,000.00) \u2248 0.0001, but since it's an open interval, x=0.0001 is excluded, so we need to check if 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 1/(3183*3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10,000.00) exactly, which is 0.0001. But since our interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001. So, n must be less than 10,000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. Therefore, n can be up to 3183 because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000.00, but 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded. So, actually, the maximum n is 3182 because 1/(3182\u03c0) would be slightly greater than 0.0001. Wait, let me compute that: 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute 3182 * 3 = 9546, 3182 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3182 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 450. So, total is approximately 9546 + 450 \u2248 9996. So, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9996, so 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996 \u2248 0.00010004, which is just slightly above 0.0001, so it's included. \n\nWait, but 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10,000.00, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 exactly, which is excluded. So, n can go up to 3182, not 3183. So, that changes the count. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3182. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. \n\nWait, so earlier I thought n went up to 3183, but since 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded, n can only go up to 3182. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. \n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. If n=3183, then x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound of the interval, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), x must be greater than 0.0001, so x=0.0001 is excluded. Therefore, n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is not included, so the maximum n is 3182, which gives x\u22480.00010004, which is included. \n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought the approximation gave me around 2865, but now with n up to 3182, it's 2864. So, which one is correct? Let me see: \n\n- For n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009967, which is less than 0.001, so included.\n- For n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.00010004, which is greater than 0.0001, so included.\n- For n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is excluded.\n\nTherefore, the maximum n is 3182, so the number of x-intercepts is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the approximation was 2865. Let me check the approximation again. The number of zeros should be approximately (10,000 - 1000)/\u03c0 = 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866. But according to the exact count, it's 2864. Hmm, that's a discrepancy of two. Maybe because the approximation counts both endpoints, but in reality, we exclude both, so we subtract two. Alternatively, perhaps the initial approximation was off because it's an open interval. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the exact count. Let me recount: n starts at 319 and ends at 3182. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that step by step:\n\n3182 - 319 = 2863\n2863 + 1 = 2864\n\nSo, that's 2864. \n\nWait, but let me check with n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009967, which is within (0.0001, 0.001). For n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.00010004, which is just above 0.0001, so included. For n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001 exactly, which is excluded. So, n goes up to 3182. \n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought the approximation was 2865, but now it's 2864. Let me see where I went wrong. The approximation was based on the number of periods between 1000 and 10,000, which is (10,000 - 1000)/(2\u03c0) periods, each contributing two zeros. So, total zeros would be approximately 2*(9000)/(2\u03c0) = 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866. But in reality, since we're excluding the endpoints, the exact count is 2864, which is two less than the approximation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approximation counts the zeros at the endpoints, but since we're excluding them, we subtract two. So, 2866 - 2 = 2864. That makes sense. \n\nSo, the exact number of x-intercepts in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2864. \n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the exact count. Let me compute 3182 - 319 + 1 again:\n\n3182 - 319 = 2863\n2863 + 1 = 2864\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought that n started at 319, which is the first integer greater than 318.309886184, and ended at 3182, which is the last integer less than 3183.09886184. So, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. \n\nWait, but let me just check one more time with specific examples. Let's take n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009967, which is less than 0.001, so included. n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.00010004, which is greater than 0.0001, so included. n=3183: x=0.0001, excluded. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182, inclusive. \n\nSo, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 2864 x-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for each integer n. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10,000. Thus, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10,000, leading to n between approximately 319 and 3182. The number of integers in this range is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\n$\\boxed{2864}$"

    "text": " So, every x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n. Now, I need to find all such x that lie in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Let me write that down: 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Substituting x = 1/(n\u03c0), this becomes 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. I can rewrite this inequality to solve for n. Let's take the reciprocals, remembering that reversing the inequalities when taking reciprocals. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those reciprocals: 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Now, dividing all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values numerically. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.3098861. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.098861. So, n must satisfy 318.3098861 < n < 3183.098861. Since n has to be an integer, n can take integer values starting from the next integer after 318.3098861, which is 319, up to the integer just below 3183.098861, which is 3183. Now, to find how many integers are in this range, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and take the floor function. So, the number of integers n is 3183 - 319 + 1. Wait, let me think: If n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But wait a second, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the inequality 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals correctly flips the inequalities, so 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing by \u03c0 gives 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098861 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098861. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, yes, 2865 intercepts. Wait, but let me think again: Is every n in that range going to give an x in the interval? Let me check with n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.06) \u2248 0.000997, which is just below 0.001, so it's within the interval. For n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.06) \u2248 0.0000999994, which is just above 0.0001, so it's within the interval. So, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive give x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, the count is correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of x-intercepts of \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we find when \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\), which occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for integer \\( n \\).

Therefore, \\( n \\) ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. \n\nThe number of integers in this range is \\( 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 \\).\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

    "text": " So, every x-intercept is at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n.\n\nNow, I need to find all such x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). That means I need to find all integers n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me write that down as inequalities:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nI can solve these inequalities for n. Let me start with the left inequality:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0)\n\nIf I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that flipping the inequality when taking reciprocals (since both sides are positive), I get:\n\n1/0.0001 > n\u03c0\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\n10000 > n\u03c0\n\nSo, n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nCalculating that, \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618.\n\nSince n is an integer, the maximum possible n is 3183.\n\nNow, let's look at the right inequality:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nAgain, taking reciprocals:\n\nn\u03c0 > 1/0.001\n\nWhich is:\n\nn\u03c0 > 1000\n\nSo, n > 1000/\u03c0\n\nCalculating that, 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618.\n\nSince n is an integer, the smallest possible n is 319.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. That would be 3183 - 319 + 1. Wait, why +1? Because when you count inclusive ranges, you subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add 1. Let me check that: if n starts at 1 and goes to 5, that's 5 numbers, which is 5 - 1 + 1 = 5. Yeah, that works.\n\nSo, 3183 - 319 = 2864, and then +1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. Let me re-express the original interval for x: (0.0001, 0.001). So, x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is the same as 1e-4 < x < 1e-3. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), that means 1e-4 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 1e-3. Taking reciprocals, as I did before, gives 1e4 > n\u03c0 > 1e3, which is 1e3 < n\u03c0 < 1e4, so n is between 1e3/\u03c0 and 1e4/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.31 < n < 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct.\n\nI should also consider whether n can be zero or negative, but since x is in (0.0001, 0.001), which is positive, and n must be positive because 1/(n\u03c0) is positive. So, n must be a positive integer. So, negative n's don't contribute, and n=0 would make x undefined, so no problem there.\n\nWait, but let me check if n can be zero. If n=0, then x would be undefined because you can't have 1/(0\u03c0). So, n starts from 1, but in our case, n starts from 319, so that's fine.\n\nAnother thing to check is whether the endpoints are included. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. So, we need to make sure that 1/(n\u03c0) is strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. So, when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0). Let me compute that: 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 1003. So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1003 \u2248 0.000997, which is approximately 0.000997, which is less than 0.001. Similarly, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183*3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001. But since the interval is open, we have to exclude x=0.0001. So, does n=3183 give x=1/(3183\u03c0) which is approximately 0.0001? Let me check that more precisely.\n\nWait, 3183 * \u03c0 is approximately 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute 3183 * 3.1415926535:\n\nFirst, 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796\nThen, 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 574.775\nAdding them together: 9424.77796 + 574.775 \u2248 10,000 (exactly, since 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 10,000). So, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10,000 = 0.0001. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which doesn't include 0.0001, so n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, n must be less than 3183, so n=3182 is the maximum n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001.\n\nWait, this is a crucial point. Let me re-examine.\n\nWe have x = 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001, so:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001 \u21d2 n\u03c0 < 10,000 \u21d2 n < 10,000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618.\n\nSo, n must be less than 3183.0988618, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is exactly the lower bound of the interval, but since the interval is open, x cannot be 0.0001. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.0988618, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) is equal to 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n that satisfies x > 0.0001 is n=3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) is slightly larger than 0.0001.\n\nWait, let's check that. Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0) and 1/(3182\u03c0).\n\nCompute 3183\u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 10,000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 exactly, but since the interval is open, we can't include that. So, the next integer below is 3182. Let's compute 3182\u03c0:\n\n3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 182\u03c0 \u2248 182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 571.869. So, 9424.77796 + 571.869 \u2248 9996.646. So, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9996.646, so 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.646 \u2248 0.000100033, which is approximately 0.000100033, which is greater than 0.0001. So, yes, x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100033 is within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n=3182 is acceptable, but n=3183 is not because x=0.0001 is excluded.\n\nSimilarly, on the upper end, when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. If n were 318, x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.0) = 0.001 exactly, which is the upper bound, but since the interval is open, we can't include n=318 because x=0.001 is excluded. So, n must be greater than 318.30988618, so the smallest integer n is 319.\n\nSo, now, the range of n is from 319 to 3182, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 gives 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but now I'm getting 2864 because n goes up to 3182 instead of 3183. So, which is correct?\n\nLet me recount. The original range was n > 318.30988618, so n starts at 319. The upper limit was n < 3183.0988618, so n goes up to 3183, but since x=1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded, so n goes up to 3182. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me take a smaller example to see if my counting is correct. Suppose I have n from 3 to 5 inclusive. That's 3,4,5: three numbers. 5 - 3 + 1 = 3, which is correct. Similarly, from 319 to 3182: 3182 - 319 = 2863, +1 gives 2864. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n goes up to 3183, but since 3183 is excluded, it's up to 3182. So, the correct count is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded, so n=3183 is not included. So, the maximum n is 3182, so the count is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but let me think again: the original inequalities were 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n can be 319, 320, ..., 3183. But wait, when n=3183, 1/(n\u03c0) = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is equal to the lower bound, which is excluded. So, n must be less than 3183.0988618, so n=3183 is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. The number of integers between a and b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, if a=319 and b=3182, then it's 3182 - 319 +1= 2864.\n\nAlternatively, the number of integers greater than 318.30988618 and less than 3183.0988618 is the floor(3183.0988618) - ceil(318.30988618) + 1. So, floor(3183.0988618)=3183, ceil(318.30988618)=319. So, 3183 - 319 +1=2865. But wait, that would include n=3183, which gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. So, perhaps this formula is incorrect in this context because the upper limit is exclusive.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the number of integers n such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3182. So, that's 3182 - 319 +1=2864.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the number of integers between 318.30988618 and 3183.0988618, it's the floor(3183.0988618 - 1) - ceil(318.30988618) +1. Because the upper bound is exclusive, so we take floor(3183.0988618 - \u03b5) where \u03b5 is a small positive number, which would be 3183 -1=3182. So, the number is 3182 - 319 +1=2864.\n\nSo, yes, the correct number is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but upon closer inspection, it's 2864 because n=3183 is excluded.\n\nLet me confirm with another approach. Let's calculate how many terms are in the sequence from n=319 to n=3182 inclusive. The number of terms is equal to the difference between the upper and lower bounds plus one. So, 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the number of integers n where n > 318.30988618 and n < 3183.0988618. So, n can be 319, 320, ..., 3182, 3183. But since 3183\u03c0 \u224810,000, which gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so n=3183 is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. So, the count is 3182 - 319 +1=2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought it was 2865, but now I'm getting 2864. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial calculation.\n\nWait, let's compute 3183 - 319 +1. 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. But that would include n=3183, which is excluded, so it's actually 2864.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the correct number is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me think again: if I have n starting at 319 and ending at 3182, the number of terms is 3182 - 319 +1. Let me compute that:\n\n3182 - 319 = 2863\n\n2863 +1 = 2864\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 2864 is the correct number.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to make sure my counting is correct. Suppose I have n from 2 to 5 inclusive. So, n=2,3,4,5: that's 4 numbers. 5 -2 +1=4, which is correct. Similarly, if I have n from 3 to 6 inclusive, that's 4 numbers: 3,4,5,6. 6-3+1=4.\n\nNow, if I have n from 3 to 5 inclusive, that's 3 numbers: 3,4,5. 5-3+1=3, which is correct.\n\nSo, applying that to our problem, from 319 to 3182 inclusive, it's 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865 because I included n=3183, but that's incorrect because x=1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded. So, the correct count is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that n=3182 gives x=1/(3182\u03c0) which is greater than 0.0001. Let me compute 1/(3182\u03c0). As I calculated earlier, 3182\u03c0 \u22489996.646, so 1/9996.646\u22480.000100033, which is indeed greater than 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nSimilarly, n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22481/1003\u22480.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but I just want to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the number of terms. Let me compute 3182 -319 +1 again:\n\n3182 - 319 = 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 -19=2863. Then, +1=2864.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 2864 x-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n gives 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3182, yielding 2864 integers.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\n$\\boxed{2864}$"

Let me write that down: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Hmm, let me solve for n in this inequality. First, let's invert all parts, remembering that inverting inequalities reverses them. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those, 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Now, to solve for n, I'll divide all parts by \u03c0. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute those values. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 1000/\u03c0 is roughly 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, n can take integer values from the smallest integer greater than 318.309886184, which is 319, up to the largest integer less than 3183.09886184, which is 3183. Now, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are inclusive). So, 3183 - 318 = 2865, and 2865 + 1 = 2866.

    "text": " \n\nSo, the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer values of n. Now, I need to find all such x that lie within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). That means I need to find all integers n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me write that inequality down: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. \n\nTo find the range of n, I can solve this inequality for n. Let me start by solving the left part: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that flipping inequalities when reciprocating (since both sides are positive), I get 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Calculating 1/0.0001 gives 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, I get n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1416, so 10000 divided by 3.1416 is roughly 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n must be less than or equal to 3183.\n\nNow, solving the right part of the inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 divided by 3.1416 is approximately 318.309. Since n must be an integer, n must be greater than or equal to 319.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that again. If 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, then n\u03c0 > 1000, so n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So the smallest integer n can be is 319. Similarly, from the left inequality, n < 3183.098, so the largest integer n can be is 3183.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers in this range, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add one (since both ends are inclusive). So, that's 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. \n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, if n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 minus 319 is indeed 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n in this range, each corresponding to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). \n\nBut hold on, let me double-check if both endpoints are included correctly. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so we need to ensure that x = 1/(n\u03c0) is strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. \n\nSo, for the lower bound: x > 0.0001 implies 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which as we saw gives n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So n can be up to 3183. Similarly, for the upper bound: x < 0.001 implies 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which gives n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n starts at 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. \n\nWait, but let me check if n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0). Let me compute 3183\u03c0: 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416. Let me compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.777, 183\u03c0 \u2248 574.894, so total \u2248 9424.777 + 574.894 \u2248 10,000. Hmm, but wait, 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10,000, which would make x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but our interval is x > 0.0001, so x=0.0001 is excluded. Therefore, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but since the interval is open, we exclude x=0.0001. So, does that mean n=3183 is not included? Wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, because when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10,000) = 0.0001, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), we need x strictly greater than 0.0001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001, which implies n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So n can be up to 3183, but when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 exactly, which is not included in the open interval. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but does that x value lie within the interval? Wait, no, because it's exactly at 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n should be 3182, because 3182\u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's see, 3180\u03c0 is about 3180 * 3.1416 \u2248 3180 * 3 = 9540, 3180 * 0.1416 \u2248 450. So total \u2248 9540 + 450 \u2248 9990. So, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 3182 * 3 = 9546, 3182 * 0.1416 \u2248 let's compute 3000*0.1416=424.8, 182*0.1416\u224825.827, so total \u2248 424.8 +25.827\u2248450.627. So total \u22489546 +450.627\u22489996.627. So, x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22481/9996.627\u22480.00010003, which is just slightly above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. Therefore, n=3182 is included because x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.00010003 > 0.0001. Similarly, n=3183 would give x\u22480.0001, which is excluded.\n\nSo, now, I think my earlier calculation was wrong because I included n=3183, but actually, n=3183 is excluded. So, the upper bound for n is 3182. Similarly, the lower bound for n is 319, as before. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n went up to 3183, but now it's 3182. Let me confirm this. So, for n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so n=3183 is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. So, the number of integers is from 319 to 3182, inclusive.\n\nSo, 3182 - 319 +1 = let's compute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 -19=2863. Then add 1: 2864. So, 2864 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me take a small example to test. Suppose I have n from 2 to 5 inclusive. The count is 5-2+1=4. So, 2,3,4,5: four numbers. Similarly, if I have n from 319 to 3182, it's 3182 -319 +1. Let me compute 3182 -319: 3182 -300=2882, 2882 -19=2863, then +1=2864. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the number of integers greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x=0.0001 exactly, which is excluded, so n goes up to 3182. Therefore, the number of n's is 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let me compute the values for n=319 and n=3182.\n\nFor n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u22481/(1003.1)\u22480.0009969, which is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nFor n=3182, x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22481/(9996.627)\u22480.00010003, which is greater than 0.0001, so included.\n\nSo, the x values go from approximately 0.00010003 down to 0.0009969 as n increases from 319 to 3182.\n\nWait, no, actually, as n increases, x decreases because x=1/(n\u03c0). So, higher n gives smaller x. So, n=319 gives x\u22480.0009969, which is near the upper end of the interval (0.0001, 0.001). As n increases, x decreases towards 0.0001. So, n=3182 gives x\u22480.00010003, which is just above 0.0001.\n\nSo, the total number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the subtraction. 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1=2864. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute the number of integers between a and b inclusive as floor(b) - ceil(a) +1. Here, a=318.309, so ceil(a)=319. b=3183.098, so floor(b)=3183. But wait, earlier we saw that n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so actually, the upper limit is floor(b)-1=3182. So, the number of integers is 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The function y=sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a very small interval near zero, the function oscillates rapidly. Each oscillation corresponds to a zero crossing, which is an x-intercept. The number of zeros in this interval is determined by how many times 1/x passes through multiples of \u03c0 as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001.\n\nSo, each zero occurs at x=1/(n\u03c0), and we need to count how many such x lie between 0.0001 and 0.001. As established earlier, n ranges from 319 to 3182, giving 2864 zeros.\n\nWait, but let me check with specific values. Let's take n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009969, which is less than 0.001, so included.\n\nn=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.00010003, which is greater than 0.0001, so included.\n\nn=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so excluded.\n\nSo, n goes up to 3182, so the count is 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

    "text": " \n\nSo, the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer values of n. Now, I need to find how many such x's lie within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Let me write that down: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. \n\nTo find the range of n, I can take reciprocals on all sides, remembering to reverse the inequalities because taking reciprocals flips the order. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those reciprocals, 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. \n\nNow, I can divide all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618.\n\nSince n has to be an integer, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618 and less than approximately 3183.0988618. So, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183. Now, to find how many integers are in this range, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add one (since both endpoints are inclusive when considering integers). \n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 integer values of n, which correspond to 2865 x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.31, so the next integer is 319. 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so the integer part is 3183. So, from 319 to 3183 inclusive, the number of integers is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me calculate that again: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. \n\nI should also consider whether the endpoints 0.0001 and 0.001 are included in the interval. The problem specifies the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is an open interval, meaning it does not include the endpoints. So, x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001, but since our x-intercepts are at x = 1/(n\u03c0), we need to ensure that 1/(n\u03c0) is strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. \n\nLet me check the smallest n: n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.5) \u2248 0.0009975, which is approximately 0.001, but slightly less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Similarly, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, but since it's an open interval, we don't include x=0.0001. Wait, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but let me compute it more accurately. \n\nWait, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 let me compute 3000*3.1416=9424.8, and 183*3.1416\u2248575.3, so total is approximately 9424.8 + 575.3 \u2248 10,000.1. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10000.1 \u2248 0.00009999, which is just under 0.0001. Therefore, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the largest n for which x=1/(n\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001 is n=3182. Wait, let me check that. \n\nWait, if n=3183 gives x\u22480.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, the maximum n where x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3182. Let me check: 3182\u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 let me compute 3000*3.1416=9424.8, and 182*3.1416\u2248572.1, so total \u2248 9424.8 + 572.1 \u2248 9996.9. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.9 \u2248 0.00010003, which is just over 0.0001, so it is included in the interval. \n\nSimilarly, the minimum n where x=1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 is n=319, as 1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009975, which is less than 0.001, so included. \n\nSo, the values of n start at 319 and go up to 3182, inclusive. Now, how many integers are there from 319 to 3182 inclusive? Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 + 1. 3182 - 319 is 2863, plus 1 is 2864. Wait, that's different from my earlier calculation. So, I think I made a mistake earlier when I included n=3183, which actually gives x just below 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the correct upper limit is n=3182. \n\nWait, let me confirm that. If n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, the largest n where x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3182, as 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.00010003, which is just over 0.0001, so included. \n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, that's 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, there are 2864 x-intercepts. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but that was because I included n=3183, which actually gives x outside the interval. So, the correct number should be 2864. \n\nLet me check this again. The x-intercepts are at x=1/(n\u03c0), where n is integer. We need 0.0001 < x < 0.001, which translates to 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.31 < n < 3183.098. So, n can be 319, 320, ..., up to 3183. But wait, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, n goes up to 3182, which gives x\u22480.00010003, which is included. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3182. \n\nSo, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. \n\nWait, but let me check the calculation with more precise numbers to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Let me compute 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0 accurately. \n\nUsing \u03c0 \u2248 3.141592653589793. \n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.141592653589793 \u2248 318.3098861837907. \n\n10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.141592653589793 \u2248 3183.098861837907. \n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.3098861837907 and less than 3183.098861837907. \n\nTherefore, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest integer n is 3183, but as we saw earlier, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. \n\nWait, but 3182\u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let me compute this precisely. \n\n3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 \n\nLet me break it down:\n\n3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796077\n\n182 * \u03c0 \u2248 182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 \n\n180 * \u03c0 \u2248 565.486677646\n\n2 * \u03c0 \u2248 6.283185307\n\nSo, 182\u03c0 \u2248 565.486677646 + 6.283185307 \u2248 571.770862953\n\nTherefore, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796077 + 571.770862953 \u2248 9996.54882372\n\nThus, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1 / 9996.54882372 \u2248 0.0001000343\n\nWhich is approximately 0.0001000343, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nSimilarly, n=3183: 3183\u03c0 \u2248 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2248 9996.54882372 + 3.1415926535 \u2248 10000. (Approximately 10000. (Wait, 9996.54882372 + 3.1415926535 \u2248 9999.69041637? Wait, no: 9996.54882372 + 3.1415926535 \u2248 9999.69041637? Wait, that can't be, because 3183\u03c0 should be approximately 10000.098861837907, as per the earlier calculation. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation here. Let me check: \n\nWait, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9996.54882372, so 3183\u03c0 \u2248 3182\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2248 9996.54882372 + 3.1415926535 \u2248 9999.69041637. Hmm, but 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098861837907, so 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.098861837907? Wait, that seems conflicting. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0 accurately. \n\n3183 * \u03c0 = 3183 * 3.141592653589793. \n\nLet me compute this using a calculator approach: \n\nFirst, 3000 * \u03c0 = 9424.77796077\n\n183 * \u03c0 = ?\n\n180 * \u03c0 = 565.486677646\n\n3 * \u03c0 = 9.4247779608\n\nSo, 183\u03c0 \u2248 565.486677646 + 9.4247779608 \u2248 574.911455607\n\nTherefore, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796077 + 574.911455607 \u2248 9999.68941638\n\nSo, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.68941638, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1 / 9999.68941638 \u2248 0.00010000314\n\nWait, that's approximately 0.00010000314, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but earlier I thought that 3183\u03c0 was approximately 10000.098861837907, which would make 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, but that seems inconsistent. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approximation. Let me compute 3183\u03c0 more accurately. \n\nWait, 3183 * \u03c0 = 3183 * 3.141592653589793\n\nLet me compute this step by step:\n\nFirst, 3000 * \u03c0 = 9424.77796077\n\n183 * \u03c0:\n\nCompute 183 * 3 = 549\n\n183 * 0.141592653589793 \u2248 183 * 0.141592653589793 \u2248\n\n183 * 0.1 = 18.3\n\n183 * 0.041592653589793 \u2248 Let's compute 183 * 0.04 = 7.32, and 183 * 0.001592653589793 \u2248 approximately 0.2914.\n\nSo, 183 * 0.041592653589793 \u2248 7.32 + 0.2914 \u2248 7.6114\n\nSo, total 183 * 0.141592653589793 \u2248 18.3 + 7.6114 \u2248 25.9114\n\nTherefore, 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 549 + 25.9114 \u2248 574.9114\n\nTherefore, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796077 + 574.9114 \u2248 9999.68936077\n\nSo, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.68936077, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1 / 9999.68936077 \u2248 0.00010000314\n\nWhich is approximately 0.00010000314, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 gives x\u22480.00010000314, which is greater than 0.0001, so it is included. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought that 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098861837907, so 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.098861837907? But according to this calculation, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.68936077, which is less than 10000. There's a discrepancy here. Let me check using a calculator: \n\nCompute 3183 * \u03c0:\n\n3183 * 3.141592653589793\n\nLet me compute this using a calculator approach:\n\n3183 * 3 = 9549\n\n3183 * 0.141592653589793 \u2248 Let's compute 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3\n\n3183 * 0.041592653589793 \u2248\n\nFirst, 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32\n\n3183 * 0.001592653589793 \u2248 Approximately 3183 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0928\n\nSo, 3183 * 0.041592653589793 \u2248 127.32 + 5.0928 \u2248 132.4128\n\nSo, total 3183 * 0.141592653589793 \u2248 318.3 + 132.4128 \u2248 450.7128\n\nTherefore, total 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 9549 + 450.7128 \u2248 9999.7128\n\nSo, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.7128, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1 / 9999.7128 \u2248 0.0001000028\n\nWhich is approximately 0.0001000028, which is just over 0.0001, so included in the interval. \n\nWait, but according to the earlier calculation, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098861837907, which would mean that 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.098861837907, which is over 10000. But our manual calculation shows 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.7128, which is under 10000. So, which one is correct? \n\nLet me check using a calculator: 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute it accurately.\n\n3183 * 3 = 9549\n\n3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248\n\nCompute 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3\n\n3183 * 0.04 = 127.32\n\n3183 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0928\n\nSo, 3183 * 0.0415926535 \u2248 127.32 + 5.0928 \u2248 132.4128\n\nSo, 3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 318.3 + 132.4128 \u2248 450.7128\n\nTherefore, total 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 9549 + 450.7128 \u2248 9999.7128\n\nSo, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.7128, which is less than 10000. Therefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000028, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nTherefore, n can be up to 3183, because 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000028 > 0.0001. So, n=3183 is included. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought that 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098861837907, so n=3183 is just over 10000/\u03c0, meaning that 1/(3183\u03c0) is just under 0.0001. But according to this manual calculation, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.7128, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000028, which is just over 0.0001. \n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from the fact that 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098861837907, so n=3183 is just over 3183.098861837907? No, 3183 is less than 3183.098861837907, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 1/(3183.098861837907\u03c0) = 0.0001. Therefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) > 0.0001, so it's included. \n\nWait, but 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098861837907, so 3183 < 3183.098861837907, so 1/(3183\u03c0) > 1/(3183.098861837907\u03c0) = 0.0001. Therefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. \n\nTherefore, n can go up to 3183, because 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000028 > 0.0001. So, n=3183 is included. \n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, that's 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001000028, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included, making the count 2865. \n\nBut earlier I thought n=3183 was excluded, but that was a mistake. It's actually included. Therefore, the correct number is 2865. \n\nWait, let me confirm this again. \n\nWe have 0.0001 < x < 0.001\n\nWhich translates to 1000 < 1/x < 10000\n\nWhich translates to 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nWhich is approximately 318.31 < n < 3183.098861837907\n\nTherefore, n can be integers from 319 up to 3183 inclusive, because 3183 < 3183.098861837907, so n=3183 is allowed. \n\nTherefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001000028, which is just over 0.0001, so included. Therefore, the count is 2865.\n\nBut in my initial calculation, I thought n=3183 gives x\u22480.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so excluded, leading to 2864. But that was incorrect because the precise calculation shows that 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.7128, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000028, which is included. Therefore, the correct count is 2865.\n\nWait, let me check with n=3183: 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.7128, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000028, which is greater than 0.0001, so included. Therefore, n=3183 is included, making the total number of x-intercepts 2865.\n\nBut let me check with n=3184: 3184\u03c0 \u2248 3184 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let me compute that: 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.7128, so 3184\u03c0 \u2248 9999.7128 + \u03c0 \u2248 9999.7128 + 3.1415926535 \u2248 10002.8544, so 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/10002.8544 \u2248 0.0000999715, which is less than 0.0001, so excluded. Therefore, n=3184 is excluded, but n=3183 is included.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more: the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), open interval. So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001.\n\nSo, 0.0001 < x < 0.001\n\nx = 1/(n\u03c0)\n\nSo, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nWhich implies:\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nWhich is approximately 318.31 < n < 3183.098861837907\n\nTherefore, n can be integers from 319 up to 3183 inclusive, because 3183 is less than 3183.098861837907, so n=3183 is allowed.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nBut earlier I thought 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.7128, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000028, which is just over 0.0001, so included. Therefore, n=3183 is included, making the total 2865.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for each integer n. We need to find how many such x-intercepts lie in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\n1. Set up the inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n2. Take reciprocals: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n3. Divide by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618.\n4. Determine the integer range: n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n5. Calculate the number of integers: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nThus, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

    "text": " \n\nSo, the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer values of n. Now, I need to find all such x that lie within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Let me write that down as inequalities: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. I can solve these inequalities for n to find the range of integers that satisfy them.\n\nStarting with the left inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides (and remember that flipping the inequality when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive), I get 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0, which is 10000 > n\u03c0. So, n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1416, so 10000 divided by 3.1416 is approximately 3183.098. So, n must be less than about 3183.098.\n\nNow, the right inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 divided by 3.1416 is approximately 318.3098. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.3098.\n\nSince n has to be an integer, n must satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Wait, let me check that: 318.3098 is just a bit above 318, so the next integer is 319. Similarly, 3183.098 is just a bit above 3183, so the maximum integer n is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183 inclusive.\n\nNow, to find how many integers are in this range from 319 to 3183. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is given by b - a + 1. So, plugging in, that would be 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, then plus 1 is 2865. So, that would suggest there are 2865 x-intercepts. But wait, let me double-check that calculation because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake with the subtraction.\n\nSo, 3183 minus 319: Let me compute 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more, which gives 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. Yeah, that seems right. So, 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure that each n in this range actually gives an x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Let me test the endpoints. For n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0). Let me compute that: 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 1003. So, 1/1003 \u2248 0.000997, which is approximately 0.001. But 0.000997 is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Similarly, for n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0). Let's compute that: 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000. So, 1/10000 is 0.0001, which is the lower bound. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) is just a bit above 0.0001, so it's within the interval.\n\nWait, but when n increases, x decreases, right? Because as n increases, 1/(n\u03c0) gets smaller. So, n=319 gives x \u2248 0.000997, which is near the upper end of the interval (0.0001, 0.001). And n=3183 gives x \u2248 0.0001, which is near the lower end. So, each n from 319 to 3183 corresponds to an x in the interval. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When n increases by 1, x decreases by 1/(n+1)\u03c0 - 1/(n\u03c0). That is, each x is a distinct point, so each n gives a unique x-intercept. So, the count should be correct. Alternatively, I can think of it as the number of times the function oscillates between 0.0001 and 0.001. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0, so in this interval, it's oscillating very rapidly. Each oscillation corresponds to one x-intercept every \u03c0/(1/x) or something like that. Wait, perhaps another way to compute it is to find how many periods are in that interval.\n\nWait, the function sin(1/x) has a period that changes with x. The period of sin(\u03b8) is 2\u03c0, so for sin(1/x), the period would be the change in x that causes \u03b8 to increase by 2\u03c0. So, d\u03b8/dx = -1/x\u00b2, so the period in terms of x would be the change in x such that d\u03b8 = 2\u03c0. So, integrating d\u03b8 = -1/x\u00b2 dx, so 2\u03c0 = \u222b dx/x\u00b2 from x1 to x2. Solving that integral, \u222b dx/x\u00b2 = -1/x + C. So, 2\u03c0 = (-1/x2) - (-1/x1) = 1/x1 - 1/x2. So, the number of periods between x1 and x2 is (1/x1 - 1/x2)/(2\u03c0). Hmm, but maybe that's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since each zero crossing occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0), the number of zero crossings between x = a and x = b is the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is between a and b. Which is exactly what I did before. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so n is between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.3098 < n < 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, giving 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the subtraction. 3183 minus 319: Let's compute 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more, so 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute it as 3183 - 319 = 2864, so the number of integers is 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me test for a smaller interval to see if the approach is correct. Suppose I take an interval like (1/(3\u03c0), 1/(\u03c0)), which is approximately (0.1061, 0.3183). The x-intercepts here would be at x = 1/(2\u03c0), 1/(3\u03c0), 1/(4\u03c0), etc., but wait, in this interval, n would be from 1 to 3, since 1/(1\u03c0) = 0.3183, which is the upper bound, but 1/(2\u03c0) \u2248 0.1591, which is inside the interval, and 1/(3\u03c0) \u2248 0.1061, which is the lower bound. So, the x-intercepts in this interval would be at n=2 and n=3? Wait, no, wait: 1/(n\u03c0) for n=1 is 0.3183, which is the upper limit, so it's not included. For n=2, 1/(2\u03c0) \u2248 0.1591, which is inside (0.1061, 0.3183). For n=3, 1/(3\u03c0) \u2248 0.1061, which is the lower limit, so it's included if the interval is inclusive, but in our problem, the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so we don't include the endpoints. Wait, but in my test case, the interval is (1/(3\u03c0), 1/(\u03c0)), which is open, so x=1/(3\u03c0) is not included, but x=1/(2\u03c0) is included, and x=1/(1\u03c0) is not included. So, only n=2 gives an x-intercept in that interval. So, the number of x-intercepts would be 1, which is correct because n=2 is the only integer between 3 and 1, but wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the bounds.\n\nWait, in my test case, the interval is (1/(3\u03c0), 1/(\u03c0)), so the x-intercepts inside this interval are at x = 1/(2\u03c0), which is n=2. So, only one x-intercept, which is correct. So, using the formula, 1/(3\u03c0) < 1/(n\u03c0) < 1/(\u03c0). So, 1/(3\u03c0) < 1/(n\u03c0) implies n < 3, and 1/(n\u03c0) < 1/(\u03c0) implies n > 1. So, n must be 2, which is correct, giving one x-intercept. So, the formula works here.\n\nSimilarly, if I take the interval (1/(4\u03c0), 1/(2\u03c0)), which is approximately (0.0796, 0.1591). The x-intercepts here would be at n=3 and n=2, but wait, 1/(3\u03c0) \u2248 0.1061, which is inside the interval, and 1/(2\u03c0) \u2248 0.1591, which is the upper bound. Since the interval is open, 0.1591 is not included, so only n=3 gives an x-intercept inside the interval. Wait, but according to the formula, 1/(4\u03c0) < 1/(n\u03c0) < 1/(2\u03c0), so 2 < n < 4. So, n=3, which is correct, giving one x-intercept. So, the formula works.\n\nWait, but in my initial problem, the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x=0.0001 and x=0.001 are not included. But the x-intercepts at x=1/(n\u03c0) for n=319 and n=3183 would be just inside the interval. Let me check for n=319: 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. For n=3183: 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10000 \u2248 0.0001, which is equal to the lower bound, but since the interval is open, x=0.0001 is not included. Wait, so does that mean that n=3183 is excluded? Because 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, which is the lower bound, and since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), it's open at 0.0001, so x=0.0001 is not included. Therefore, n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is not in the interval, so we should exclude it.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So, in my initial calculation, I included n=3183, but since x=1/(3183\u03c0) is equal to 0.0001, which is not in the open interval, I should exclude it. Similarly, n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, the range of n should be from 319 up to 3182, because 3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the inequalities. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, solving for n:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u21d2 n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098.\n\nSimilarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u21d2 n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u21d2 n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098.\n\nSo, n must be an integer greater than 318.3098 and less than 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183, but wait, 3183 is less than 3183.098, so n=3183 is allowed. But wait, when n=3183, 1/(n\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is exactly the lower bound, but the interval is open at 0.0001, so x=0.0001 is not included. Therefore, n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so n must be less than 3183.098, meaning the maximum integer n is 3183, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is not in the interval. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) is slightly larger than 0.0001, so it's inside the interval.\n\nWait, let me compute 1/(3182\u03c0). So, 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 3182 * 3 = 9546, 3182 * 0.1416 \u2248 3182 * 0.1 = 318.2, 3182 * 0.04 = 127.28, 3182 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0912. So, adding those together: 9546 + 318.2 = 9864.2 + 127.28 = 9991.48 + 5.0912 \u2248 9996.5712. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.5712 \u2248 0.000100034, which is just a bit above 0.0001, so it's inside the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n=3182 gives x\u22480.000100034, which is inside, while n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001, which is excluded.\n\nSimilarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.000997, which is inside the interval. So, the range of n is from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 gives 2864. So, there are 2864 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, that's different from my initial calculation. So, I had 2865 before, but upon realizing that n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, I have to subtract one, giving 2864.\n\nWait, let me check that again. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, if n starts at 319 and ends at 3182, then the count is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863. Then, 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so n goes up to 3182. So, the total number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another example. Suppose I have the interval (1/(4\u03c0), 1/(2\u03c0)), which is approximately (0.0796, 0.1591). The x-intercepts in this interval are at n=3 and n=2, right? Wait, n=2 gives x=1/(2\u03c0)\u22480.1591, which is the upper bound, but since the interval is open, it's excluded. So, only n=3 gives x=1/(3\u03c0)\u22480.1061, which is inside the interval. So, the number of x-intercepts is 1. Using the formula: 1/(4\u03c0) < 1/(n\u03c0) < 1/(2\u03c0). So, n must satisfy 2 < n < 4. So, n=3, which is correct, giving 1 x-intercept.\n\nSimilarly, in the interval (1/(5\u03c0), 1/(3\u03c0)), which is approximately (0.0637, 0.1061), the x-intercepts are at n=4 and n=3. Wait, n=3 gives x=1/(3\u03c0)\u22480.1061, which is the upper bound, excluded, so only n=4 gives x=1/(4\u03c0)\u22480.0796, which is inside. So, only 1 x-intercept. So, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, since n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. The function sin(1/x) has an x-intercept at each x=1/(n\u03c0). So, in the interval (a, b), the number of x-intercepts is the number of integers n such that a < 1/(n\u03c0) < b. Which is equivalent to 1/(b\u03c0) < n < 1/(a\u03c0).\n\nSo, in our case, a=0.0001, b=0.001. So, 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0). Which is 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. As before, 1000/\u03c0\u2248318.3098, 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.098. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183. But since 1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001 is excluded, n goes up to 3182. So, number of integers is 3182 - 319 +1=2864.\n\nWait, but let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0) precisely. 3183 * \u03c0 = let's compute it more accurately. \u03c0\u22483.1415926535. So, 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute 3000\u03c0\u22489424.77796. 183\u03c0\u2248183*3.1415926535\u2248574.723. So, total is 9424.77796 + 574.723\u22489999.50096. So, 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22481/9999.50096\u22480.00010000498, which is just a bit above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but earlier I thought it was exactly 0.0001, but actually, it's slightly above. So, perhaps n=3183 gives x\u22480.00010000498, which is inside the interval. So, perhaps I was wrong earlier to exclude n=3183.\n\nWait, so 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00010000498, which is just a bit above 0.0001, so it's inside the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 is included, giving x\u22480.00010000498, which is inside the interval. So, then the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 +1=2865.\n\nWait, but wait, 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00010000498, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, n=3183 is allowed, so the count is 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that 3183\u03c0\u224810000, but more accurately, 3183\u03c0\u22489999.50096, so 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00010000498, which is indeed inside (0.0001, 0.001). So, n=3183 is included, so the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with a calculator. Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0. 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let's compute step by step:\n\n3183 * 3 = 9549\n\n3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3\n\n3183 * 0.04 = 127.32\n\n3183 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3183 * 0.001 = 3.183\n\n3183 * 0.0005926535 \u2248 Approximately 3183 * 0.0005 = 1.5915\n\nAdding up: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 3.183 = 448.803 + 1.5915 \u2248 450.3945\n\nSo, total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9549 + 450.3945 \u2248 9999.3945\n\nTherefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.3945 \u2248 0.000100006, which is approximately 0.000100006, which is just above 0.0001, so it's inside the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 is included, so the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that 3183\u03c0\u224810000, but it's actually about 9999.3945, so 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000100006, which is inside the interval. So, n=3183 is included, so the total number is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check for n=3183: 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000100006, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n=3183 is allowed, so the count is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. The number of x-intercepts is equal to the number of zeros of sin(1/x) in (0.0001, 0.001). Each zero occurs at x=1/(n\u03c0), so the number of such x in the interval is the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001). Which translates to n being in (1000/\u03c0, 10000/\u03c0). So, n ranges from ceiling(1000/\u03c0) to floor(10000/\u03c0). Let's compute ceiling(1000/\u03c0): 1000/\u03c0\u2248318.3098, so ceiling is 319. Similarly, floor(10000/\u03c0)=floor(3183.098)=3183. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 + 1=2865.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000100006, which is inside the interval, so n=3183 is included. So, the count is 2865.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

    "text": " \n\nSo, the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer values of n. Now, I need to find all such x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Let me write down the inequalities: 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), I can substitute that into the inequalities to find the range of n.\n\nStarting with the left side: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). To solve for n, I can take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that taking reciprocals reverses the inequality. So, 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0, which simplifies to 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, I get n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me calculate that: 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1416, which is roughly 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n can be at most 3183.\n\nNow, looking at the right side of the interval: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, I get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that, 1000 / 3.1416 is approximately 318.309. Since n must be an integer, n must be at least 319.\n\nWait, hold on, let me check that again. If 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, then n\u03c0 > 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, the smallest integer n is 319.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. To find the number of integers from a to b inclusive, it's b - a + 1. So, plugging in the values, it's 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n, which correspond to 2865 x-intercepts in the interval.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in determining the range of n. The x-intercepts are at x = 1/(n\u03c0). The interval is (0.0001, 0.001). So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, substituting x = 1/(n\u03c0) into these inequalities gives:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u2192 n\u03c0 < 10000 \u2192 n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n \u2264 3183.\n\nAnd,\n\n1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u2192 n\u03c0 > 1000 \u2192 n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n \u2265 319.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865.\n\nSo, that seems correct. So, there are 2865 x-intercepts in that interval.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches zero. In the interval from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is a very small interval near zero, the function oscillates rapidly. Each time x passes a point where x = 1/(n\u03c0), the function crosses the x-axis. So, the number of crossings should correspond to how many such points lie within the interval.\n\nBut let me visualize this. As x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000. So, \u03b8 = 1/x goes from 10000 down to 1000. So, sin(\u03b8) will oscillate between -1 and 1, crossing zero every \u03c0 units. So, the number of zeros is the number of times \u03b8 passes through a multiple of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000.\n\nWait, but \u03b8 is decreasing from 10000 to 1000 as x increases. So, each time \u03b8 passes a multiple of \u03c0, we get a zero. So, the number of zeros is the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. But since \u03b8 is decreasing, we're effectively counting the number of n where 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nWait, but earlier I had n starting at 319 because 319\u03c0 \u2248 1000.3, which is just above 1000, and n ending at 3183 because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000. So, the number of n's is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the number of integer n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309 and less than approximately 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is: the number of zeros is the number of times \u03b8 passes through a multiple of \u03c0 as \u03b8 goes from 1000 to 10000. So, the number of multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000 is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0) + 1. Let me compute that:\n\n10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so floor(10000/\u03c0) = 3183.\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so ceil(1000/\u03c0) = 319.\n\nSo, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that matches.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the direction. Since \u03b8 is decreasing from 10000 to 1000, the number of zeros is the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. So, each multiple of \u03c0 corresponds to a zero crossing. So, the number of zeros is indeed the number of n where n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nDividing all parts by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nWhich is approximately 318.309 < n < 3183.098.\n\nSo, n can be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nNumber of integers: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check if 319\u03c0 is greater than 1000 and 3183\u03c0 is less than 10000.\n\nCompute 319\u03c0: 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's compute 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477, 19\u03c0 \u2248 59.690, so total \u2248 942.477 + 59.690 \u2248 1002.167. So, 319\u03c0 \u2248 1002.167, which is greater than 1000, so 319 is the smallest n where n\u03c0 > 1000.\n\nSimilarly, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416. Let me compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.777, 183\u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.1416 \u2248 575.000. So, total \u2248 9424.777 + 575.000 \u2248 10,000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000. So, 3183\u03c0 is exactly 10,000 if \u03c0 were exactly 3.1415926535, but since it's approximate, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000. So, 3183 is the largest n where n\u03c0 < 10,000.\n\nTherefore, the number of n's is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check the exact calculation for 3183\u03c0. Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0:\n\n3183 * 3.1415926535.\n\nLet me compute 3000 * \u03c0 = 9424.77796077\n\n183 * \u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 575.00000000 (since 183 is 60*3.05, but more accurately, 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 575.00000000 because \u03c0 \u2248 22/7, but 183 * 22/7 \u2248 183 * 3.142857 \u2248 575.000). So, 3000\u03c0 + 183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796077 + 575.00000000 \u2248 10,000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000 exactly? Wait, no, because \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 3183 * 3.1415926535 = ?\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.\n\nLet me compute 3183 * \u03c0:\n\nFirst, 3000 * \u03c0 = 9424.77796077\n\nThen, 183 * \u03c0:\n\nCompute 180 * \u03c0 = 565.486677646\n\n3 * \u03c0 \u2248 9.4247779608\n\nSo, 183\u03c0 \u2248 565.486677646 + 9.4247779608 \u2248 574.911455607\n\nSo, total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796077 + 574.911455607 \u2248 10,000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000. So, 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10,000. So, 3183\u03c0 is less than 10,000? Wait, 3183 * 3.1415926535 = ?\n\nLet me compute 3183 * 3.1415926535:\n\n3183 * 3 = 9549\n\n3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.1415926535\n\nCompute 3000 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 424.7779607\n\n183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 25.9114556\n\nSo, total \u2248 424.7779607 + 25.9114556 \u2248 450.6894163\n\nSo, total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9549 + 450.6894163 \u2248 9999.6894163, which is just under 10,000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.6894, which is less than 10,000.\n\nSo, 3183\u03c0 < 10,000, so 3183 is included.\n\nSimilarly, 319\u03c0 \u2248 1002.167, which is greater than 1000, so 319 is included.\n\nTherefore, the number of n's is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check if 3183 is included. Since 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.6894 < 10,000, so yes, 3183 is included.\n\nSimilarly, 319\u03c0 \u2248 1002.167 > 1000, so 319 is included.\n\nSo, the total number of zeros is 2865.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The function sin(1/x) has a zero at each x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, for each integer n, there's a zero at x = 1/(n\u03c0). Now, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is x between 0.0001 and 0.001, we need to find how many x's of the form 1/(n\u03c0) lie within this interval.\n\nSo, x must satisfy 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nWhich is equivalent to 1/(0.001) > n\u03c0 > 1/(0.0001).\n\nWhich is 1000 > n\u03c0 > 10000.\n\nWait, hold on, that seems contradictory to what I had before. Wait, no: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nSo, taking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities):\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001.\n\nWhich is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nAh, so that's where I went wrong earlier. I think I mixed up the inequalities. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nTaking reciprocals:\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001.\n\nWhich is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nSo, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nThus, the number of integers n is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, so that's the same result as before, but now I see that I initially had the inequalities reversed, but then corrected it. So, the number is indeed 2865.\n\nBut wait, let me think again: the interval is (0.0001, 0.001). So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 1/x must be between 1000 and 10000. So, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). Therefore, 1/(n\u03c0) must be between 0.0001 and 0.001, which implies that n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000, as above.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so n must be between 319 and 3183, as before.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought about it, I thought that as x approaches zero, the function oscillates more and more, so in a small interval near zero, there should be a huge number of oscillations. But 2865 seems like a lot, but considering the interval is from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is a factor of 10 in x, but since 1/x is going from 1000 to 10000, which is a factor of 10 in \u03b8, and each \u03c0 interval in \u03b8 corresponds to a zero crossing. So, the number of zero crossings would be approximately (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 \u2248 9000/3.1416 \u2248 2866, which is close to 2865, so that seems reasonable.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 2865.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me do a smaller example to test my approach.\n\nSuppose I want to find the number of zeros in (0.001, 0.002). So, x in (0.001, 0.002). Then, 1/x is in (500, 1000). So, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, 0.001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.002.\n\nTaking reciprocals:\n\n1/0.002 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.001\n\nWhich is 500 < n\u03c0 < 1000.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 500/\u03c0 \u2248 159.15 < n < 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309.\n\nSo, n ranges from 160 to 318 inclusive.\n\nNumber of integers: 318 - 160 + 1 = 159.\n\nSo, there should be 159 zeros in (0.001, 0.002).\n\nLet me check that with a calculation:\n\nCompute 160\u03c0 \u2248 502.65, which is greater than 500.\n\n318\u03c0 \u2248 1000.00 (since 318 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 1000).\n\nSo, the number of n's is 318 - 160 + 1 = 159.\n\nSo, that seems correct. So, in this smaller interval, there are 159 zeros, which is roughly (1000 - 500)/\u03c0 \u2248 500/3.1416 \u2248 159.15, which matches.\n\nTherefore, applying the same logic to the original problem, the number of zeros in (0.0001, 0.001) is (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 \u2248 9000/3.1416 \u2248 2866, which is 2865 when calculated precisely.\n\nSo, I think I can confidently say that the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need to find how many such x lie in (0.0001, 0.001).\n\n1. Set up inequalities: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n2. Taking reciprocals: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n3.

    "text": " So, each x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n. Now, the interval given is from 0.0001 to 0.001. Let me write that as (0.0001, 0.001). Since we're dealing with x-intercepts, I need to find all integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies within this interval. So, I can set up inequalities: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me solve for n in these inequalities. Starting with the left inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides (and reverse the inequality because I'm taking reciprocals of positive numbers), I get 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. So, 10000 > n\u03c0. Then, dividing both sides by \u03c0, I get n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating 10000 divided by \u03c0, which is approximately 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n is an integer, the maximum possible n is 3183. Now, the right inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n\u03c0 > 1000, which means n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating 1000 divided by \u03c0, which is approximately 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618. Since n is an integer, the smallest possible n is 319. Therefore, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, to find how many integers are in this range, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, 3183 - 318 = 2865, and 2865 + 1 = 2866. Wait, let me double-check that. If n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, it's 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. Let me check for n=319: x = 1/(319\u03c0). Let me compute 319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 1003. So, x \u2248 1/1003 \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001. Okay, that's within the interval. For n=3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183*3.1416) \u2248 1/10000 \u2248 0.0001, but since it's 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.000..., so x \u2248 0.0001, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), we have to check if 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Wait, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but exactly, 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001. So, does that mean that n=3183 is just below 0.0001? Let me check more accurately. Let's compute 3183 * \u03c0: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796. Then, 183\u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 574.6435. So, total is 9424.77796 + 574.6435 \u2248 9999.4215. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.4215, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.4215 \u2248 0.0001000057, which is just over 0.0001. Wait, that's confusing because 3183\u03c0 is approximately 9999.4215, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001000057, which is just over 0.0001. So, since our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at both ends, does x=1/(3183\u03c0) lie within (0.0001, 0.001)? Let me compute 0.0001000057 is greater than 0.0001, so yes, it's within the interval. Therefore, n=3183 is included. So, that means the maximum n is 3183, and the minimum n is 319, so the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Wait, but earlier I thought that 3183\u03c0 was about 9999.4215, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000057, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. So, that means n can be 319 up to 3183, inclusive. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But let me check n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 1003. So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. And n=3183: 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000057, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. So, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive are valid, giving 2865 x-intercepts. Therefore, the answer is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for each integer n. We need to find how many such x-values lie within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\n1. Set up the inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n2. Solving for n:\n   - From 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001: n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618, so n \u2264 3183.\n   - From 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001: n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, so n \u2265 319.\n3. The integers n range from 319 to 3183, inclusive.\n4. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nThus, the number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

Let me write that down: 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), substituting, I get 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. \n\nI think I should solve for n here. Let me rearrange the inequalities. Starting with 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that flipping inequalities when taking reciprocals reverses them, I get 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Calculating 1/0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, I get n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n < 3183.0988618.\n\nNow, the other inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n\u03c0 > 1000, meaning n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n > 318.30988618.\n\nSince n has to be an integer, n must be greater than 318.30988618, so the smallest integer n can be is 319. Similarly, n must be less than 3183.0988618, so the largest integer n can be is 3183. \n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the values, it's 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. \n\nWait, let me double-check that calculation. 3183 minus 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. \n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me verify the steps again. \n\n1. The x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0).\n2. We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n3.

So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n5. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nI think that's correct. Another way to check is to consider how the function behaves. As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is very close to zero, the function will oscillate very rapidly. Each oscillation corresponds to a period of 2\u03c0 in the argument, so each period would give one positive and one negative crossing, but since we're only interested in x-intercepts, each period would give two x-intercepts. Wait, no, actually, each period of sin(\u03b8) has two x-intercepts: one at the start and one in the middle, but actually, each period has two zeros, but in terms of x-intercepts, each zero crossing is a single point. Wait, no, sin(\u03b8) crosses zero once between each maximum and minimum, so each period has two zeros: one at \u03b8 = n\u03c0 and another at \u03b8 = (n+1)\u03c0. Hmm, but in terms of x, each zero corresponds to a single x value. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), the number of zeros would be proportional to the number of n's such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) falls within that interval. So, as I calculated, n ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider the endpoints. When x approaches 0.0001 from the right, 1/x approaches 10000, so the corresponding n is just under 3183.0988618, so the largest integer n is 3183. Similarly, when x approaches 0.001 from the left, 1/x approaches 1000, so n is just over 318.30988618, so the smallest integer n is 319. Therefore, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 2865.\n\nI think that's solid.

Which is 1000 < n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that: 1000/3.14159265 \u2248 318.309. So n has to be greater than 318.309, meaning the smallest integer n can be is 319.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the numbers: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then adding 1 gives 2865. \n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me double-check my calculations. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. The number of terms in this sequence is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319 first: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more, which is 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865. So, that seems correct.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me think about the endpoints. When n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0). Let me compute that: 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 1003.5, so x \u2248 1/1003.5 \u2248 0.0009965, which is just above 0.0001, so that's within the interval. Similarly, when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/10000.03 \u2248 0.00009999, which is just below 0.001, so that's also within the interval.\n\nWait, but 0.00009999 is less than 0.001, so it's within (0.0001, 0.001). But wait, 0.00009999 is actually less than 0.0001, so maybe I made a mistake here. Because 0.00009999 is 0.00009999, which is 9.999e-5, which is less than 0.0001 (which is 1e-4). So, that would be outside the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Hmm, so perhaps I need to adjust the upper limit.\n\nWait, so when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0). Let me compute 3183\u03c0 more accurately. 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.777, then 183\u03c0 \u2248 574.646, so total is approximately 9424.777 + 574.646 \u2248 9999.423. So, 1/x \u2248 9999.423, so x \u2248 1/9999.423 \u2248 0.0001000057. Wait, that's approximately 0.0001000057, which is just over 0.0001, so it's within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, that's correct. So, n = 3183 gives x \u2248 0.0001000057, which is within the interval.\n\nWait, but earlier when I approximated 3183\u03c0 as 10000, that was a mistake because 3183 * \u03c0 is actually approximately 9999.423, not 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000057, which is just barely above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.5) \u2248 0.0009965, which is just below 0.001, so that's included as well. So, both endpoints are included, so the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, inclusive. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that's correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check a few more points. For example, n = 318: x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.75) \u2248 0.00099925, which is just below 0.001, so it's still within the interval. Wait, but earlier I thought n starts at 319, but n=318 gives x \u2248 0.00099925, which is still within (0.0001, 0.001). So, perhaps my initial calculation was off.\n\nWait, no, because when I solved 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, I got n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183. Similarly, for 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n starts at 319.\n\nWait, but when n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.00099925, which is less than 0.001, so it's still within the interval. So, why did I set n starting at 319? Because 1/(318\u03c0) is approximately 0.00099925, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, perhaps n starts at 318, not 319.\n\nWait, let me recast the inequalities. The inequality is 0.0001 < x < 0.001. So, x = 1/(n\u03c0), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let's solve for n.\n\nStarting with 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which gives n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183.\n\nSimilarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 gives n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, so the minimum integer n is 319.\n\nWait, but when n=318, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099925, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, why did I get n > 318.309, meaning n starts at 319? Because 318.309 is approximately 318.31, so the next integer is 319. But 318 is less than 318.31, so 318 is allowed? Wait, no, because n has to be greater than 318.309, so n must be at least 319. So, n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0) \u22480.00099925, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Wait, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is less than that, so it's not included. Hmm, that seems contradictory.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in solving the inequality. Let me re-express the inequalities step by step.\n\nWe have x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < x < 0.001.\n\nGiven x = 1/(n\u03c0), so substituting, we have:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nLet's solve for n in each inequality.\n\nFirst inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0).\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0 (positive, so inequality sign remains):\n\n0.0001 * n\u03c0 < 1.\n\nDivide both sides by 0.0001:\n\nn\u03c0 < 1 / 0.0001 = 10000.\n\nSo, n < 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.098.\n\nSecond inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0:\n\n1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0.\n\nDivide both sides by 0.001:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0.\n\nDivide both sides by \u03c0:\n\nn > 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.309.\n\nSo, combining both inequalities, n must satisfy 318.309 < n < 3183.098.\n\nSince n must be an integer, the smallest integer greater than 318.309 is 319, and the largest integer less than 3183.098 is 3183.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865.\n\nTherefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought about n=318, I saw that x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.00099925, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. But according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is less than that, so it's excluded. So, n starts at 319, which gives x\u22480.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22481/(1003.5)\u22480.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. And n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001000057, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included as well.\n\nSo, the total number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Since each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept, and there are 2865 integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, that should be the number of x-intercepts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the number of times the sine function oscillates as x approaches zero. But in this case, since we're dealing with a specific interval, the calculation seems correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: the function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly as x approaches zero. In the interval from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is from 1e-4 to 1e-3, the function will cross the x-axis each time x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, the number of crossings is the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) lies between 1e-4 and 1e-3.\n\nWhich is exactly what I calculated earlier, leading to n from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer. 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n</think>\n\nThe number of x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is determined by finding the integer values of n for which x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies within the interval. Solving the inequalities, we find that n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, resulting in 2865 x-intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer values of n. Now, I need to find all such x that lie within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). That means I need to find all integers n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me write that inequality down:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nI can solve this inequality for n to find the range of integers that satisfy it. Let me first handle the left part of the inequality:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0).\n\nIf I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that reversing the inequality when taking reciprocals (since both sides are positive), I get:\n\n1/0.0001 > n\u03c0.\n\nCalculating 1/0.0001, that's 10000. So,\n\n10000 > n\u03c0.\n\nDividing both sides by \u03c0,\n\nn < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nSimilarly, let's handle the right part of the inequality:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nAgain, taking reciprocals,\n\nn\u03c0 > 1/0.001.\n\n1/0.001 is 1000, so,\n\nn\u03c0 > 1000.\n\nDividing both sides by \u03c0,\n\nn > 1000/\u03c0.\n\nSo, putting it all together, n must satisfy:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nNow, let me calculate the numerical values of 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535.\n\nCalculating 1000/\u03c0:\n\n1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184.\n\nSimilarly, 10000/\u03c0:\n\n10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n must start from the next integer after 318.309886184, which is 319, and go up to the integer just below 3183.09886184, which is 3183.\n\nWait, let me check that. If 3183.09886184 is the upper limit, then the largest integer n can be is 3183 because 3183 is less than 3183.09886184, and 3184 would be larger than that. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nNow, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can use the formula for the number of integers from a to b inclusive, which is b - a + 1.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\nNumber of x-intercepts = 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864.\n\nThen, 2864 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, the x-intercepts are at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, when x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000, which means that n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000, so n is between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.31 to 3183.098. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183.\n\nCalculating the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319. 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then minus 19 more is 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Each n corresponds to a unique x-intercept in the interval. So, each integer n from 319 to 3183 gives a unique x = 1/(n\u03c0) in (0.0001, 0.001). So, the number of x-intercepts is equal to the number of integers in that range, which is 2865.\n\nHmm, that seems like a lot of oscillations. The function sin(1/x) is known for its oscillatory behavior as x approaches zero, with the oscillations becoming more frequent. So, in the interval from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is a range of 0.0009, the function would cross the x-axis many times. Each crossing corresponds to a change in the sign of sin(1/x), which happens every time 1/x increases by \u03c0. So, the number of zeros is proportional to the length of the interval in terms of 1/x.\n\nWait, let me consider the interval (0.0001, 0.001). The corresponding 1/x values are from 10000 to 1000. The difference between these is 9000. Each zero crossing occurs every \u03c0 units in the 1/x variable. So, the number of zeros should be approximately 9000 / \u03c0, which is about 2866. Hmm, but my earlier calculation gave 2865. That's very close. The slight difference is because we're dealing with integer counts and the exact bounds.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the exact values again. Let me compute 1000/\u03c0 more precisely. Using \u03c0 \u2248 3.141592653589793.\n\n1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.3098861837907.\n\nSimilarly, 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.098861837907.\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.3098861837907 and less than 3183.098861837907.\n\nSo, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest integer n is 3183.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864.\n\n2864 + 1 = 2865.\n\nSo, that's consistent. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but when I thought about the approximate number of zeros as 9000/\u03c0, which is about 2866, but the exact count is 2865. The difference is because the endpoints are exclusive. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x = 0.0001 and x = 0.001 are not included. Therefore, the corresponding n values would be for x just greater than 0.0001 and just less than 0.001.\n\nSo, n would be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886, so n starts at 319, and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886, so n goes up to 3183.\n\nThus, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again: Each x-intercept corresponds to a unique n, so each n from 319 to 3183 gives a unique x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, the count is 2865.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked all the steps, and the logic holds. So, the final answer should be 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, meaning x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need these x-values to lie between 0.0001 and 0.001. Solving for n, we find n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

    "text": " So, the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer values of n. Now, I need to find all such x that lie within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, let's write that as an inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. My goal is to find all integers n that satisfy this inequality. Let me solve for n. Starting with the left part of the inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that taking reciprocals reverses the inequality, I get 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Calculating 1/0.0001, that's 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, I get n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute 10000 divided by \u03c0. Since \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n is an integer, the maximum possible n here is 3183. Now, let's look at the right part of the inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 318.3098862. Since n must be greater than this value, the smallest integer n can be is 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range, from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers, we subtract the smaller from the larger and add one (since both endpoints are included). So, 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies within (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 10000/\u03c0 is approximately 3183.0988618, so n must be less than that, so n_max is 3183. Then, 1000/\u03c0 is approximately 318.3098862, so n must be greater than that, so n_min is 319. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Hmm, that seems correct.

    "text": " \n\nNow, I need to find all such x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, I can set up inequalities: 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), substituting that in gives 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. I can solve this inequality for n to find the range of integers n that satisfy it. \n\nLet me rewrite the inequalities:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nFirst, I can take reciprocals on all parts, remembering that taking reciprocals reverses the inequalities. So, that gives:\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nCalculating those reciprocals:\n\n1/0.001 = 1000, and 1/0.0001 = 10000.\n\nSo, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nNow, I can divide all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nLet me compute those values. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So:\n\n1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184\n\nSimilarly, 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184.\n\nBut n has to be an integer because n\u03c0 is where sin(1/x) is zero. So, n can take integer values starting from the next integer after 318.309886184, which is 319, up to the integer just below 3183.09886184, which is 3183.\n\nNow, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1.\n\nSo, plugging in the values: 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that subtraction: 3183 - 319. Hmm, 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more, which gives 2864. Yes, that's correct. So, adding 1 gives 2865.\n\nTherefore, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Each of these n corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in interpreting the interval. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is an open interval, meaning it doesn't include the endpoints. So, I need to check whether x = 1/(n\u03c0) actually lies strictly between 0.0001 and 0.001, not including the endpoints.\n\nGiven that n starts at 319, which gives x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(319 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(1002.74) \u2248 0.00099726, which is less than 0.001, so that's within the interval. Similarly, n = 3183 gives x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000.0000000001) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound. But since the interval is open, x cannot be exactly 0.0001, so I need to check if n=3183 gives x just above 0.0001 or exactly at 0.0001.\n\nWait, let me compute x for n=3183:\n\nx = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000.0000000001) \u2248 0.0001 exactly. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, x = 0.0001 is not included. Therefore, n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. So, n should go up to 3182 instead of 3183.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0):\n\n3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute that:\n\nFirst, 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796077\nThen, 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 574.21570851\nAdding them together: 9424.77796077 + 574.21570851 \u2248 10,000.0000000001. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000.0000000001, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 exactly. So, x=0.0001 is when n=3183, but since the interval is open, we exclude x=0.0001. Therefore, n should only go up to 3182.\n\nWait, but let me check n=3182:\n\nx = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000 - some small amount) \u2248 just above 0.0001.\n\nWait, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let me compute that:\n\n3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute 3000\u03c0 = 9424.77796077, 182\u03c0 \u2248 182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 571.428571428 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Wait, actually, 182 * \u03c0 \u2248 182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 571.428571428.\n\nWait, no, 182 * \u03c0 is approximately 571.428571428? Wait, that can't be right because 100\u03c0 \u2248 314.159, so 180\u03c0 \u2248 565.487, and 182\u03c0 \u2248 565.487 + 2\u03c0 \u2248 565.487 + 6.283 \u2248 571.770. So, 3182\u03c0 = 3000\u03c0 + 182\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796077 + 571.770 \u2248 9996.548.\n\nSo, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.548 \u2248 approximately 0.000100035, which is just above 0.0001. Therefore, x=1/(3182\u03c0) is approximately 0.000100035, which is within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n=3182 is included, but n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded.\n\nSo, now, the range of n is from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Now, let's compute the number of integers between 319 and 3182 inclusive.\n\nUsing the formula: number of integers = upper bound - lower bound + 1.\n\nSo, 3182 - 319 + 1 = ?\n\n3182 - 319: Let's compute 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863. Then, adding 1 gives 2864.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 3182 - 319 = 2863, then adding 1 gives 2864. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier when I included n=3183, I got 2865, but now excluding n=3183, it's 2864. Let me confirm that.\n\nWait, another way: The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1.\n\nSo, 3182 - 319 + 1 = 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about it as starting at n=1, the number of terms up to n=3182 is 3182, and up to n=318, it's 318. So, the number from 319 to 3182 is 3182 - 318 = 2864.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me just double-check my calculations because I don't want to make a mistake here.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nSo, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so the smallest integer n is 319.\n\nSimilarly, n must be less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so the largest integer n is 3183. But since x=1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded, so the largest n is 3182.\n\nTherefore, n runs from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, number of terms is 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\nCompute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863.\n\nThen, 2863 + 1 = 2864.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me also check if n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0) which is approximately 1/(1002.74) \u2248 0.00099726, which is less than 0.001, so that's within the interval. Similarly, n=3182 gives x\u22480.000100035, which is just above 0.0001, so that's within the interval.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial setup, let me think again.\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x). The zeros occur at 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nTaking reciprocals and flipping inequalities: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nDivide by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, n must be integers from 319 to 3183, but since n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, n goes up to 3182.\n\nNumber of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive: 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that between 0.0001 and 0.001, each zero occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer n. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001). So, solving for n, we get n in (1000/\u03c0, 10000/\u03c0), which is approximately (318.309886184, 3183.09886184). So, the integers n start at 319 and end at 3183, but since 3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, the last n is 3182.\n\nThus, the number of x-intercepts is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nThe number of x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is determined by finding integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies within the interval. This results in 2864 such integers, so there are 2864 x-intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2864}$"
