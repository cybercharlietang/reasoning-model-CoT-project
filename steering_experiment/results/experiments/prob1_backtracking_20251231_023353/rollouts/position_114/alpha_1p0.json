    "text": " So, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.477796 \u2248 0.0009975, which is less than 0.001, so included. Therefore, both n=319 and n=3183 give x within the interval, so our count is correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial calculation. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, so the number of terms is 3183 - 319 +1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 is 2865. So, yes, 2865. Therefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but hold on a second, I think I might have made a mistake here. Because when I calculated n > 318.309, so n starts at 319, and n < 3183.098, so n ends at 3183. But when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000100003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.0009975, which is just below 0.001, so it's included. Therefore, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive are valid. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 is 2865. So, 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. The function sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. The number of oscillations increases as x approaches 0. The interval from x=0.0001 to x=0.001 is 0.0009 in length. The function sin(1/x) has a period of 2\u03c0/(1/x) when x is small, but actually, the period as a function of x is a bit tricky because it's not a standard sine function. Alternatively, we can think about how many times the argument 1/x passes through multiples of \u03c0 as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001.\n\nEach time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the sine function completes a half-period, meaning it crosses zero. So, the number of zeros is approximately the number of times 1/x crosses multiples of \u03c0 in that interval.\n\nSo, when x goes from 0.001 to 0.0001, 1/x goes from 1000 to 10000. So, the range of 1/x is from 1000 to 10000. The number of zeros is the number of times 1/x crosses an integer multiple of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000.\n\nSo, the smallest multiple of \u03c0 greater than 1000 is ceiling(1000/\u03c0) * \u03c0. Similarly, the largest multiple of \u03c0 less than 10000 is floor(10000/\u03c0) * \u03c0.\n\nWait, but let me compute 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so the next integer is 319, so the first multiple is 319\u03c0 \u2248 1003.5.\n\nSimilarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so the largest multiple less than 10000 is 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.689.\n\nSo, the number of multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000 is from n=319 to n=3183, which is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865, which matches our earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the number of zeros is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again: as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001, 1/x increases from 1000 to 10000. Each time 1/x passes a multiple of \u03c0, the sine function crosses zero. So, the number of zeros is the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000.\n\nSo, the first multiple of \u03c0 after 1000 is 319\u03c0 \u2248 1003.5, and the last multiple before 10000 is 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.689. The number of such multiples is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nThus, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nI think that's consistent across different methods, so I'm confident the answer is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

    "text": " Let me compute 319\u03c0 more accurately. 319 * 3.1415926535: Let's compute 300 * \u03c0 = 942.477796 19 * \u03c0 \u2248 59.6902604 So, 942.477796 + 59.6902604 \u2248 1002.168056 So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.168056 \u2248 0.00099783, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval. So, n=319 gives x \u2248 0.00099783, which is within (0.0001, 0.001). So, both n=319 and n=3183 are included, so the count from 319 to 3183 inclusive is correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but I'm a bit concerned because when I subtract 3183 - 319, I get 2864, then adding 1 gives 2865. So, that seems correct. Let me just check with a small example again. Suppose I have n from 1 to 3. Then, 3 -1 = 2, plus 1 is 3, which is correct. Another example: n from 5 to 7. 7 -5 = 2, plus 1 is 3, which is correct (5,6,7). So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me think again. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is close to zero, the function oscillates rapidly. Each oscillation corresponds to a zero crossing. The zeros occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer n. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), how many such zeros are there?\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the number of zeros as the number of times 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0 as x moves from 0.001 to 0.0001. So, when x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001, 1/x increases from 1000 to 10000. So, the number of zeros is the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. That is, the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nWait, but that's slightly different from what I did earlier. Wait, if x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, then 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000 as x moves from 0.001 to 0.0001. So, the zeros occur when 1/x = n\u03c0, so n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nSo, solving for n: n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, same result as before. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me check with another approach. The function sin(1/x) has a period of 2\u03c0/(1/x) = 2\u03c0x. Wait, no, that's not correct. The period of sin(1/x) is not straightforward because as x changes, the argument 1/x changes nonlinearly. Instead, the zeros occur at regular intervals in terms of 1/x. So, each zero is spaced by \u03c0 in the 1/x scale. So, the number of zeros between a and b (where a < b) is approximately (b - a)/\u03c0. But in this case, a = 0.0001, b = 0.001, but since we're dealing with 1/x, the spacing in terms of 1/x is \u03c0. So, the number of zeros would be roughly (1/0.0001 - 1/0.001)/\u03c0 = (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 \u2248 9000/3.1416 \u2248 2866.197. Hmm, that's approximately 2866. But our earlier calculation gave 2865. So, there's a discrepancy of 1. Hmm, maybe because of the inclusive counting. Wait, let's see: (10000 - 1000) = 9000. 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.197. So, about 2866 intervals, which would correspond to 2867 zeros? Wait, no, because each interval between zeros is \u03c0, so the number of zeros would be approximately (9000)/\u03c0 +1? Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think: The number of zeros between 1/x = 1000 and 1/x = 10000 is the number of multiples of \u03c0 in that interval. So, starting at 1000, the first zero is at 1000 + (\u03c0 - (1000 mod \u03c0)), but perhaps it's better to just compute the number as floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0) +1.\n\nWait, let me compute 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so ceil(1000/\u03c0) = 319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so floor(10000/\u03c0) = 3183. So, the number of zeros is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865, which matches our earlier result. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but in the earlier estimation using the interval (1/x from 1000 to 10000), the number of zeros is roughly (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 \u2248 9000/3.1416 \u2248 2866.197. So, approximately 2866. But our exact calculation is 2865. So, why the difference? It's because when we take the floor and ceiling, we might lose a count. Let me check: 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so the integer part is 3183, meaning that 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.0, but since 3183\u03c0 is slightly less than 10000, as we saw earlier, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.689, so 10000 is not exactly 3183\u03c0, but just a bit more. So, the number of zeros less than 10000 is 3183, but since 3183\u03c0 is less than 10000, the next zero would be at 3184\u03c0, which would be beyond 10000, so we don't include it. Similarly, the first zero after 1000 is at 319\u03c0, which is just above 1000. So, the count is from n=319 to n=3183, inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, that's correct. The approximate method gave us about 2866, but the exact count is 2865. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, after all these checks, I can confidently say that the number of x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where the function crosses the x-axis, i.e., where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

So, both endpoints are included because the x-values are within the open interval. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is indeed 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Wait, but let me check if n=3183 is the last n where x is still above 0.0001. If I take n=3184, then x=1/(3184\u03c0).

Since the function y = sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely as x approaches 0, but in our case, we're only looking between x=0.0001 and x=0.001. So, each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the sine function completes a half-period, so each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, we get another zero crossing. So, the number of zero crossings should correspond to how many times 1/x can be an integer multiple of \u03c0 within the interval. Which is exactly what we calculated.

Let me use a calculator for better accuracy. 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.141592653589793 \u2248 Let me compute 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.141592653589793 \u2248 Let's compute 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, 3183 * 0.001592653589793 \u2248 Let's compute 3183 * 0.001 = 3.183, 3183 * 0.000592653589793 \u2248 approx 3183 * 0.0005 \u2248 1.5915, so total for 0.001592653589793 is approx 3.183 + 1.5915 \u2248 4.7745.

Therefore, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. Similarly, n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001000031, which is just over 0.0001, so included. So, yes, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nI think that's thorough enough.

But just to be thorough, let me think if there's any other consideration. For example, does sin(1/x) cross zero exactly once between each consecutive pair of x-intercepts? Well, sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches zero, but in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), the function is sin(1/x), which is periodic but with increasing frequency as x decreases. Each time 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0, sin(1/x) crosses zero. So, each zero crossing corresponds to a unique n, so each n gives exactly one zero crossing in that interval.

Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the initial step where I set 1/x = n\u03c0. So, solving sin(1/x) = 0 gives 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). That seems correct.\n\nAlso, the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is between 1/10000 and 1/1000, so x must be greater than 1/10000 and less than 1/1000.\n\nTherefore, 1/(n\u03c0) must be between 1/10000 and 1/1000, which leads to n being between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately between 318.309 and 3183.098, so n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 2865 intercepts.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm that I didn't make a mistake in the calculation of the number of integers. Let me take a small example again. Suppose I have n from 5 to 10 inclusive. The numbers are 5,6,7,8,9,10. That's 6 numbers. Using the formula: 10 - 5 +1 =6. Correct. So, applying that, 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3183 - 319. Let's compute 3183 minus 300 first, which is 2883. Then subtract 19 more: 2883 -19 =2864. So, yes, 2864, plus 1 is 2865.\n\nWait, but I'm thinking, does each n correspond to exactly one x-intercept? Yes, because for each integer n, x = 1/(n\u03c0) is a unique solution in that interval. So, each n gives exactly one x-intercept, and there's no overlap or missing intercepts.\n\nWait, but another way to think about this is to consider how many times the sine function oscillates as x approaches zero. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates more and more frequently as x approaches zero. So, in the interval from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is very close to zero, the function oscillates rapidly. Each oscillation corresponds to a period of 2\u03c0 in the argument 1/x, so each period corresponds to a change in x of approximately 1/(n\u03c0) - 1/((n+1)\u03c0) = 1/(\u03c0(n(n+1))). But perhaps that's complicating things.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of the number of zeros as the number of times 1/x crosses an integer multiple of \u03c0 as x moves from 0.001 down to 0.0001. Each time 1/x decreases by \u03c0, we cross another zero. So, starting from x=0.001, 1/x=1000. Then, as x decreases to 0.0001, 1/x increases to 10000. So, the number of zeros is the number of times 1/x crosses n\u03c0 for n from 319 to 3183, which is the same as before.\n\nWait, so maybe another way to compute the number of zeros is to compute how many times n\u03c0 falls between 1000 and 10000, but that seems similar to what I did earlier.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when x is in (0.0001, 0.001), then 1/x is in (1000, 10000). So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. The zeros of sin(1/x) occur when 1/x = n\u03c0, so n\u03c0 must be in (1000, 10000). So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 and less than 10000/\u03c0. So, n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098861 and n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098862. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is the same as before. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nWait, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. So, that seems to confirm that the number is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the initial substitution. So, y = sin(1/x). The zeros occur when sin(1/x) = 0, which is when 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, x must be in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n:\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001: n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098862\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001: n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098861\n\nSo, n must be integers greater than 318.3098861 and less than 3183.098862, which means n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked this enough times, and each time I arrive at the same conclusion. So, the number of x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine when \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

Therefore, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive are valid, giving x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Wait, but let me check if n=3183 is indeed the largest integer where x > 0.0001. Let me see: n=3183 gives x \u2248 0.0001000031, which is just above 0.0001. If I take n=3184, then x=1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3184 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10002.68) \u2248 0.000099973, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. Therefore, n cannot be 3184, so the upper limit is indeed n=3183. Similarly, n=318 gives x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.07) \u2248 0.00099993, which is just below 0.001, but wait, our lower bound was n > 318.309, so n starts at 319. Let me check n=318: x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.07) \u2248 0.00099993, which is less than 0.001, so it's included? Wait, no, because our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be less than 0.001. Wait, but n=318 gives x\u22480.00099993, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Wait, but earlier I thought n starts at 319 because n > 318.309. Let me check that again. The inequality was n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. So, n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0) \u22480.00099993, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Wait, but that contradicts the initial inequality. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in solving the inequality. Let me go back. The inequality was 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which implies n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. Therefore, n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0) \u22480.00099993, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval. But according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is less than that, so it's not included. Wait, that seems contradictory. Let me check the math again. The inequality is 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u2192 n\u03c0 > 1000 \u2192 n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. Therefore, n=318 is not included because 318 < 318.309. But when n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0) \u22480.00099993, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, this suggests that n=318 is valid, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is less than that, which would imply that 1/(318\u03c0) > 0.001, which is not the case. Wait, this is confusing. Let me compute 1/(318\u03c0): 318 * \u03c0 \u2248 1000.07, so 1/1000.07 \u22480.00099993, which is less than 0.001, so x=0.00099993 is within (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=318 should be included. But according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is less than that, which would mean that 1/(318\u03c0) > 0.001, but that's not the case. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in solving the inequality. Let me re-examine the inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u2192 n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2192 n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. But wait, when n=318, 1/(318\u03c0) \u22480.00099993 < 0.001, so it's valid. Therefore, my initial inequality might have been set up incorrectly. Wait, let's see: The original condition is that x must be less than 0.001, so 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u2192 n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, so n starts at 319. But when n=318, 1/(318\u03c0) \u22480.00099993 < 0.001, which satisfies the condition. Therefore, my inequality was correct, but n=318 is less than 318.309, yet it satisfies the condition. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in interpreting the inequality. Let me think again: If I have 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, then n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, meaning n=319,320,... So, n=318 would give 1/(318\u03c0) \u22480.00099993, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. But according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is less than that, which would imply that 1/(318\u03c0) > 0.001, which is not the case. Therefore, perhaps the inequality should be n \u2265 319 to satisfy n > 318.309. But wait, n=318 is less than 318.309, but 1/(318\u03c0) \u22480.00099993 < 0.001, so it's included. Therefore, perhaps the initial approach is missing some n's. Wait, let me approach this differently. Let me consider that x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let's solve for n in each inequality.\n\nFirst inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u2192 n\u03c0 < 10000 \u2192 n < 10000/\u03c0 \u22483183.098.\n\nSecond inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u2192 n\u03c0 > 1000 \u2192 n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248318.309.\n\nTherefore, n must satisfy 318.309 < n < 3183.098.\n\nSince n must be an integer, n can be from 319 up to 3183 inclusive.\n\nThus, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that n=318 gives x\u22480.00099993, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. But according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is excluded. Therefore, n=318 is not included, but x=1/(318\u03c0) is within the interval. Therefore, perhaps my initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that n must satisfy both inequalities. So, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098. Therefore, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, giving 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nBut wait, when n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.00099993, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. But according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is excluded. Therefore, there's a discrepancy here. Let me check the math again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in solving the inequality. Let me solve 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 again. So, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u2192 n\u03c0 > 1000 \u2192 n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. Therefore, n=318 is excluded because 318 < 318.309, even though 1/(318\u03c0) \u22480.00099993 < 0.001. Therefore, perhaps the inequality is correct, and n=318 is excluded because it's less than 318.309, even though x is still within the interval. Therefore, the count is from n=319 to n=3183, giving 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but that seems counterintuitive because n=318 gives x\u22480.00099993, which is within (0.0001, 0.001), so shouldn't it be included? Let me check the inequality again.\n\nIf x must be less than 0.001, then 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u2192 n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=319 is the first integer. Therefore, n=318 is excluded because it's less than 318.309, even though x=1/(318\u03c0) is less than 0.001. Therefore, the count is from n=319 to n=3183, giving 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but that seems odd because n=318 is giving x within the interval, but according to the inequality, it's excluded. Therefore, perhaps my initial approach is correct, and n=318 is excluded because n must be greater than 318.309. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the inequality is n > 318.309, so n starts at 319, and the count is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nTherefore, after careful consideration, I think the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we start by noting that \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\) when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for some integer \\( n \\). This implies \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n\nWe need \\( x \\) to satisfy \\( 0.0001 < x < 0.001 \\). Substituting \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\) into this inequality, we get:\n\\[ 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\]\n\nSolving these inequalities for \\( n \\):\n1.

The smallest integer \\( n \\) is 319, and the largest integer \\( n \\) is 3183.\n\nThe number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is calculated as:\n\\[ 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts is \\(\\boxed{2865}\\)."

So, the count from n=319 to n=3183 inclusive is correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Wait, but let me just think again: when n=319, x\u22480.0009975, which is just under 0.001, so it's included. When n=3183, x\u22480.0001000031, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included.

Since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, and 1/(3183\u03c0) is just over 0.0001, so yes, it's included. Similarly, n=319 gives x just under 0.001, which is included.

For x in (0.0001, 0.001), n ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 intercepts.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify where sin(1/x) = 0:**\n   - The sine function is zero when its argument is an integer multiple of \u03c0. So, sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 = n\u03c0, where n is any integer.\n\n2. **Set up the equation for x-intercepts:**\n   - For y = sin(1/x) to be zero, 1/x must equal n\u03c0. Thus, 1/x = n\u03c0 \u21d2 x = 1/(n\u03c0).\n\n3. **Determine the range of x:**\n   - We're looking for x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). This translates to:\n     - 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\n4. **Solve the inequalities for n:**\n   - From 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001:\n     - n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098\n   - From 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001:\n     - n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309\n\n5. **Determine the integer values of n:**\n   - n must be an integer, so n ranges from the smallest integer greater than 318.309 (which is 319) to the largest integer less than 3183.098 (which is 3183).\n\n6. **Calculate the number of integers in the range:**\n   - The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is (3183 - 319) + 1 = 2865.\n\n7. **Verify the endpoints:**\n   - For n=319, x \u2248 0.0009975, which is within (0.0001, 0.001).\n   - For n=3183, x \u2248 0.0001000031, which is just above 0.0001 and thus included in the open interval.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."
