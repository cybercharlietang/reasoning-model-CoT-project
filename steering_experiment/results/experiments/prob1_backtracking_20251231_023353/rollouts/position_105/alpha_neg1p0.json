So, the count remains 2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me think again: when n increases by 1, x decreases by 1/(n+1)\u03c0 - 1/n\u03c0 = (n - (n+1))/(n(n+1)\u03c0) = (-1)/(n(n+1)\u03c0).

Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: the number of integers between a and b inclusive is b - a +1.

Wait, but just to make sure, is there any n beyond 3183 that would still give x > 0.0001? Let's see: if n=3184, then x=1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3184*3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000.000000...) \u2248 0.0001, but since 3184\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000, 1/(3184\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001, which would be below our interval. So, n=3184 would give x < 0.0001, which is outside the interval. So, n must be less than or equal to 3183. Similarly, n=318 gives x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.000000...) \u2248 0.001, but since 318\u03c0 is approximately 1000, 1/(318\u03c0) is approximately 0.001, but our interval is open at 0.001, so x must be less than 0.001. Wait, but n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.001000..., which is exactly 0.001, but since our interval is open, x=0.001 is excluded. Therefore, n=318 would give x=0.001, which is not included.

So, n=3184 is excluded, which is why n goes up to 3183. Similarly, n=318 gives x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000) \u2248 0.001, which is the upper bound, but since the interval is open, n=318 is excluded, and we start at n=319.

Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial step, let me think again. The function is sin(1/x), and we're looking for zeros in x between 0.0001 and 0.001. Each zero occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0), so we need to find all integers n where 1/(n\u03c0) is between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, solving for n: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities because reciprocating positive numbers reverses the inequality): 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.

The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Yep, that seems consistent.

Let's compute 3184 * \u03c0: 3000\u03c0 \u22489424.77796, 184\u03c0\u2248578.03822, so total\u22489424.77796 + 578.03822\u22489999.81618. Therefore, 1/(3184\u03c0)\u22481/9999.81618\u22480.0001000018, which is still greater than 0.0001. Wait, but that can't be, because as n increases, x decreases. So, 3184\u03c0 is slightly larger than 3183\u03c0, so 1/(3184\u03c0) is slightly less than 1/(3183\u03c0), so 0.0001000018 is less than 0.0001000031. Wait, but 0.0001000018 is still greater than 0.0001, so x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0001000018 is still in the interval. Hmm, so perhaps my initial calculation of n=3183 being the upper limit was incorrect. Wait, because when n increases beyond 3183, x=1/(n\u03c0) decreases, but as long as x > 0.0001, it's still in the interval. So, maybe I need to find the maximum n such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. Let me solve for n: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u2192 n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u22483183.09886. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.09886. Since n is an integer, the maximum n is 3183. So, n can be up to 3183. So, n=3183 is included, but n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0001000018, which is still greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier thought that n=3183 was the maximum. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inequality. Let me re-express the inequality correctly. We have x > 0.0001, which is equivalent to 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. Solving for n: n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0). So, n must be less than approximately 3183.09886, which means the maximum integer n is 3183. Therefore, n can be from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. So, that would give us 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865 x-intercepts. Wait, but when I plug n=3184, I get x\u22480.0001000018, which is still greater than 0.0001, so shouldn't n=3184 also be included? Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me check 3184\u03c0: 3184 * \u03c0 \u22483184 *3.1415926535. Let me compute 3000\u03c0\u22489424.77796, 184\u03c0\u2248578.03822, so 3184\u03c0\u22489424.77796 +578.03822\u22489999.81618. So, 1/(3184\u03c0)\u22481/9999.81618\u22480.0001000018, which is indeed greater than 0.0001, so x=0.0001000018 is within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3184 should also be included. Wait, but according to the inequality n < 3183.09886, n must be less than approximately 3183.09886, so n=3183 is the maximum integer. But 3184 is greater than 3183.09886, so n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0001000018, which is still greater than 0.0001, so it's within the interval. Wait, that suggests that my initial calculation was wrong because n=3184 is allowed. So, perhaps I need to compute the maximum n such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. Let me solve for n:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 > 0.0001 * n\u03c0\nDivide both sides by 0.0001\u03c0: n < 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) = 10000 / \u03c0 \u22483183.09886\n\nSo, n must be less than approximately 3183.09886, meaning the maximum integer n is 3183. Therefore, n=3184 would give 1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0001000018, which is still greater than 0.0001, but according to the inequality, n must be less than 3183.09886, so n=3184 is not allowed. Wait, that's a contradiction because 3184 is greater than 3183.09886, but 1/(3184\u03c0) is still greater than 0.0001. So, perhaps the inequality is not correctly capturing the upper bound. Alternatively, maybe I should take the floor of 1/(0.0001\u03c0). Let me compute 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u22483183.09886. So, the maximum integer n such that n < 3183.09886 is 3183. Therefore, n=3183 is the maximum. So, n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0001000018, which is still greater than 0.0001, but n=3184 is greater than 3183.09886, so according to the inequality, it's not allowed. Wait, but that can't be right because 1/(3184\u03c0) is still greater than 0.0001. So, perhaps the correct way is to take the floor of 1/(0.0001\u03c0), which is 3183, and then check if n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001000031, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Then, n=3184 would give x\u22480.0001000018, which is still greater than 0.0001, but n=3184 is beyond the upper limit set by the inequality, so perhaps it's excluded. Wait, but that seems contradictory because 1/(3184\u03c0) is still within the interval. Maybe I need to approach this differently. Let me consider that n must satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0). Since n must be an integer, the maximum n is floor(1/(0.0001\u03c0)) = floor(3183.09886) = 3183. Therefore, n=3183 is the maximum. So, even though n=3184 gives x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0001000018, which is still greater than 0.0001, it's beyond the maximum allowed n, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865 x-intercepts. Wait, but that seems a bit counterintuitive because n=3184 would still give x within the interval. Maybe I need to check with exact values. Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0) and 1/(3184\u03c0) more precisely. Let's compute 3183\u03c0: 3183 * \u03c0 \u22483183 *3.141592653589793. Let's compute 3183 *3=9549, 3183*0.141592653589793\u2248 Let me compute 3183 *0.1=318.3, 3183*0.04=127.32, 3183*0.001592653589793\u2248 Let's compute 3183*0.001=3.183, 3183*0.000592653589793\u2248 Approx 3183*0.0005=1.5915, 3183*0.000092653589793\u2248 Approx 0.295. So, adding up: 3.183 +1.5915=4.7745 +0.295\u22485.0695. So, total 3183\u03c0\u22489549 +318.3 +127.32 +5.0695\u22489549 + 318.3=9867.3 +127.32=9994.62 +5.0695\u22489999.6895. So, 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22481/9999.6895\u22480.0001000031. Similarly, 3184\u03c0=3183\u03c0 +\u03c0\u22489999.6895 +3.1416\u224810002.8311. So, 1/(3184\u03c0)\u22481/10002.8311\u22480.0000999716. Wait, that's less than 0.0001. Wait, that can't be right because 10002.8311 is greater than 10000, so 1/10002.8311\u22480.0000999716, which is less than 0.0001. Therefore, x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0000999716, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3184 gives x=0.0000999716 <0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3183, because n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001000031 >0.0001, and n=3184 gives x\u22480.0000999716 <0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 3183 -319 +1=2865 x-intercepts. Okay, that makes sense now. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm with n=3183 and n=3184:\n\nn=3183: x\u22480.0001000031 >0.0001 \u2192 included.\n\nn=3184: x\u22480.0000999716 <0.0001 \u2192 excluded.\n\nSo, n=3183 is the last valid n.\n\nSimilarly, for the lower end, n=319: x\u22480.0009965 <0.001 \u2192 included.\n\nn=318: x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22481/(1000.0)\u22480.001, but since our interval is open, x=0.001 is excluded, so n=318 gives x\u22480.001, which is the upper limit, but not included. Therefore, the smallest n is 319, giving x\u22480.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so included.\n\nThus, the total number of x-intercepts is 3183 -319 +1=2865.\n\nSo, after carefully checking, I'm confident that the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.6894 \u2248 0.0001000031. So, that's 0.0001000031, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, for n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477796, plus 19\u03c0 \u2248 59.69026042 \u2248 942.477796 + 59.69026042 \u2248 1002.168056. So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.168056 \u2248 0.00099785, which is less than 0.001, so it's included as well. Therefore, both n=319 and n=3183 give x values within the interval. So, the count remains 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Wait, but let me think again: when n=3183, x is just above 0.0001, and when n=319, x is just below 0.001. So, all integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive are valid. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 = 2865. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Another approach could be to consider how many times the sine function oscillates as x approaches 0. Since 1/x approaches infinity as x approaches 0 from the positive side, sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. However, in our case, we're only looking at x between 0.0001 and 0.001, so 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, the function sin(1/x) will oscillate between -1 and 1, crossing zero each time 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0. So, the number of zeros is equal to the number of multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1000 \u2264 n\u03c0 \u2264 10000. Dividing through by \u03c0, we get 1000/\u03c0 \u2264 n \u2264 10000/\u03c0. Calculating those: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is the same as before. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the logic. So, the final answer is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check one more thing: when I compute 3183 - 319, I get 2864, then adding 1 gives 2865. But just to make sure, let me compute it step by step. 3183 minus 319: Let's break it down. 3183 - 300 = 2883. Then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. Correct. So, yeah, I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) crosses the x-axis whenever 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0, i.e., at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer n. Within the interval (0.0001, 0.001), 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. Thus, n must satisfy 1000 \u2264 n\u03c0 \u2264 10000, leading to n from 319 to 3183. The count of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.6894 \u2248 0.000100003. So, yes, that's just over 0.0001, so included in the interval. Similarly, n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 1003.4997, so 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so included. So, both endpoints are included in the open interval because the function approaches the endpoints from within the interval. Therefore, the count is 2865. Wait, but let me check another way. The number of zeros of sin(1/x) in (a, b) is equal to the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (a, b). So, the number of n is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)). Wait, let me think about that. Let me define a = 0.0001 and b = 0.001. Then, 1/(n\u03c0) must be in (a, b), so n must satisfy 1/(b\u03c0) < n < 1/(a\u03c0). So, n must be greater than 1/(b\u03c0) and less than 1/(a\u03c0). So, the number of integers n is floor(1/(a\u03c0) - 1) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0) + 1). Wait, maybe I should use the formula: number of integers between c and d is floor(d) - ceil(c) +1. So, in this case, c = 1/(b\u03c0) \u2248 318.309, and d = 1/(a\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, the number of integers n is floor(d) - ceil(c) +1 = 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865, which matches our earlier calculation. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) has x-intercepts where \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\).

So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.6894 \u2248 0.0001000031. So, that's just a bit above 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477796, 19\u03c0 \u2248 59.69026042, so total \u2248 942.477796 + 59.69026042 \u2248 1002.168056. So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.168056 \u2248 0.00099784, which is less than 0.001, so included in the interval. So, both n=319 and n=3183 give x within the interval, so they are both included. Therefore, the count from n=319 to n=3183 inclusive is correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the subtraction earlier. 3183 - 319: 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then minus 19 more is 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of it as the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a +1. So, 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, that's the number of x-intercepts in the given interval. I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Another approach could be to consider the behavior of sin(1/x). As x approaches 0 from the positive side, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates increasingly rapidly between -1 and 1. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a very small interval near zero, the function sin(1/x) will oscillate many times. Each oscillation corresponds to a peak and a trough, and between each peak and trough, there's a zero crossing. So, the number of zero crossings in this interval is essentially the number of times 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0 as x moves from 0.001 down to 0.0001. Each time 1/x crosses n\u03c0, where n is an integer, we get a zero. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001), which is exactly what I calculated earlier. So, that reinforces that the number of zeros is 2865. Therefore, I'm confident that the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me check if n=3183 is indeed included. Because 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.000100003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.00099784, which is just below 0.001, so it's included. So, both endpoints are included in the interval, meaning that n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, inclusive. Therefore, the count is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that the function sin(1/x) has a zero whenever 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). The interval (0.0001, 0.001) is equivalent to (1/10000, 1/1000). So, 1/(n\u03c0) must lie between 1/10000 and 1/1000. Therefore, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating those: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nWait, that's exactly what I did earlier. So, this alternative approach confirms the same result.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\). This occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for some integer \\( n \\), which implies \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n\nWe need \\( x \\) to be within the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\).

The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0, but in this case, our interval is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is very close to zero. Each oscillation corresponds to a zero crossing when 1/x increases by \u03c0, so each zero crossing occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, the number of zero crossings is the number of integers n such that x is in (0.0001, 0.001). So, the calculation seems correct.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps.

So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.6894 \u2248 0.0001000031, which is just slightly above 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, for n=3184, x=1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3184 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10002.0) \u2248 0.00009998, which is below 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, n=3183 is the last n where x is just above 0.0001. Similarly, for n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.0) \u2248 0.001, but since 318\u03c0 \u2248 1000.0, so 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.001 exactly. But since the interval is open at 0.001, we don't include x=0.001, so n=318 would give x=0.001, which is not included. Therefore, n starts at 319, because n=319 gives x\u22480.0009965, which is just below 0.001, so it's included. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865 x-intercepts. Wait, but let me check: if n=319 gives x\u22480.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. And n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001000031, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive are valid, giving 2865 x-intercepts. So, I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me think about the behavior of the function y = sin(1/x). As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is very close to zero, the function oscillates rapidly, crossing the x-axis each time 1/x increases by \u03c0. So, each time x decreases by 1/(n\u03c0), the function completes another oscillation, leading to another x-intercept. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is indeed the number of integer n's such that x =1/(n\u03c0) lies in (0.0001, 0.001), which we found to be 2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to be absolutely sure. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n:\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001:\nn < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001:\nn > 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886\n\nSo, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886 and less than approximately 3183.09886. Since n must be an integer, the smallest integer greater than 318.309886 is 319, and the largest integer less than 3183.09886 is 3183. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 +1. Let me compute that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n2864 +1 = 2865\n\nSo, yes, 2865 integers. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nI think that's correct. So, the final answer is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n gives 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183, resulting in 2865 integer values of n, hence 2865 x-intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.6894 \u2248 0.0001000031. So, yes, it's just over 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 is included. Similarly, n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477796, 19\u03c0 \u2248 59.69026042, so total \u2248 942.477796 + 59.69026042 \u2248 1002.168056.

So, the number of x-intercepts is indeed 2865. Wait, but just to make sure, let me think about the function y = sin(1/x). It oscillates more and more rapidly as x approaches 0. So, between 0.0001 and 0.001, it's oscillating a lot. Each oscillation corresponds to a period of 2\u03c0 in the argument of the sine function. So, the number of oscillations would be roughly the change in 1/x divided by 2\u03c0. Let me see: from x=0.0001 to x=0.001, 1/x goes from 10000 to 1000. So, the change in 1/x is 10000 - 1000 = 9000. The number of periods would be 9000 / (2\u03c0) \u2248 9000 / 6.283 \u2248 1432. So, each period has two x-intercepts (zero crossings), so the number of x-intercepts would be approximately 2 * 1432 \u2248 2864. Hmm, that's very close to 2865, which is what I got earlier. So, that seems to confirm that the number is around 2865. Therefore, I think the answer is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integers n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n gives n between approximately 318.309 and 3183.098. The integers n range from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.6894 \u2248 0.0001000031. So, that's approximately 0.0001000031, which is indeed greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, for n=319: 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 300 * \u03c0 \u2248 942.477796 19 * \u03c0 \u2248 59.69026042 So total \u2248 942.477796 + 59.69026042 \u2248 1002.168056.

Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, giving x values within (0.0001, 0.001). So, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Wait, but let me make sure that n=3183 is included. Since x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000031, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Similarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.00099785, which is less than 0.001, so included. Therefore, the total number is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. But wait, let me compute 3183 - 319. 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then minus 19 more is 2864. Then, 2864 +1 = 2865. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when we have an open interval (a, b), do we include the endpoints? No, we don't. But in this case, the x-intercepts occur at x=1/(n\u03c0), which for n=319 is approximately 0.00099785, which is less than 0.001, so it's inside the interval. Similarly, for n=3183, x\u22480.0001000031, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's inside the interval. So, both endpoints of the n range correspond to x values within the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive are valid, leading to 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something: does each n correspond to exactly one x-intercept? Yes, because each n gives a unique x=1/(n\u03c0), and since sin(1/x) crosses zero at each of these points, each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept. So, the total number is indeed 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check if I didn't make a mistake in the initial calculation of n's bounds. Let me re-express the inequalities:\n\nWe have 0.0001 < x < 0.001\n\nBut x = 1/(n\u03c0), so:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nTaking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities because reciprocating positive numbers reverses the inequality):\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDivide all parts by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nCalculating:\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098861\n\n10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098862\n\nSo, n must be integers strictly greater than 318.3098861 and strictly less than 3183.098862.\n\nTherefore, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nYes, that confirms my earlier result.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: the number of integers between a and b is floor(b) - ceil(a) +1, but in this case, since a and b are not integers, it's the same as the number of integers n satisfying a < n < b, which is floor(b) - ceil(a) +1? Wait, let me think: if a=318.309..., ceil(a)=319, and b=3183.098..., floor(b)=3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865, which matches.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3183 - 319. 3183 minus 300 is 2883, minus 19 more is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the number of x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.168056 \u2248 0.00099783, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, both n=319 and n=3183 give x within the interval. Therefore, the count from n=319 to n=3183 inclusive is correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Wait, but let me think again: the function sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches zero. Each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the sine function completes a half-period, right? So, the number of zeros in the interval (a, b) where 0 < a < b < 1 would be roughly proportional to the length of the interval in terms of 1/x. But in this case, we've directly calculated the number of zeros by finding the range of n that satisfies the x-interval. So, I think the approach is solid. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Solving for x gives x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nSolving for n:\n\nn > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309  \nn < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098\n\nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is:\n\n3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Wait, but just to make sure, let me check if n=3183 is indeed the last n where x is still greater than 0.0001. Let me compute n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001000031>0.0001, so included. What about n=3184? x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22481/(3184*3.1415926535). Let's compute 3184\u03c0\u22483183\u03c0 + \u03c0\u22489999.6894 +3.1415926535\u224810002.831.

Therefore, n=3183 is the largest n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) >0.0001, so it's included. Similarly, n=318 is 1/(318\u03c0)\u22481/(1000.000...) Wait, 318\u03c0\u2248318*3.1415926535\u2248318*3=954, 318*0.1415926535\u2248318*0.1=31.8, 318*0.0415926535\u224813.225, so total\u2248954+31.8=985.8+13.225\u22481000.025. So, 1/(318\u03c0)\u22481/1000.025\u22480.000999975, which is just under 0.001, so it's included. But wait, our lower bound is n=319, so n=318 would give x\u22480.000999975, which is less than 0.001, but since our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, does x=0.000999975 count? Wait, 0.000999975 is less than 0.001, so it's included. Wait, but earlier I thought n starts at 319, but wait, n=318 gives x\u22480.000999975, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. But wait, according to earlier calculation, n must be greater than 318.309, so n starts at 319. So, n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.000999975, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But wait, according to our initial inequality, n must be greater than approximately 318.309, so n=319 is the first integer greater than 318.309. So, n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.000999975, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. But wait, if n=318 is included, then our lower bound should be n=318, not 319. Did I make a mistake earlier? Let me go back. The inequality was 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, so n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. Therefore, n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.000999975, which is less than 0.001, but n=318 is less than 318.309, so it's not included. Wait, that's conflicting with my previous calculation. Wait, no, the inequality was n > 318.309, so n must be greater than that, so n starts at 319. Therefore, n=318 is not included because 318 < 318.309. Therefore, n=319 is the first n that satisfies n > 318.309. So, n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.000999975, which is less than 0.001, but since n=318 is less than 318.309, it's not included in the range. Therefore, n starts at 319. So, the count is from n=319 to n=3183, inclusive. So, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 +1=2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me just confirm with n=318: if n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.000999975, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. But according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is less than that, so it's not included. Therefore, n starts at 319. So, the count is correct as 2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me just think again: each time n increases by 1, x decreases by 1/(n(n+1)\u03c0), which is a small amount. So, the function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly as x approaches 0. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a small interval near zero, the function oscillates a lot. Each oscillation between a peak and a trough crosses the x-axis twice, but in this case, since we're looking for zeros, each zero corresponds to a point where 1/x crosses an integer multiple of \u03c0. So, each zero is at x=1/(n\u03c0), so each n corresponds to exactly one zero. Therefore, the number of zeros is equal to the number of integers n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) lies in (0.0001, 0.001). So, as we've calculated, that's 2865.\n\nWait, but let me just check the arithmetic again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where the function crosses the x-axis, i.e., where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\). This occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for some integer \\( n \\), which implies \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n\nWe need \\( x \\) to be in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\). Therefore, we solve for \\( n \\) in the inequalities:\n\\[ 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\]\n\nRewriting these inequalities:\n\\[ 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\implies n < \\frac{1}{0.0001\\pi} \\approx 3183.098 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\implies n > \\frac{1}{0.001\\pi} \\approx 318.309 \\]\n\nThus, \\( n \\) must be an integer in the range from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers in this range is calculated as:\n\\[ 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts of \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\) is \\(\\boxed{2865}\\)."

Therefore, the count from n=319 to n=3183 inclusive is correct, giving 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me just think again: when I subtract 3183 - 319, I get 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, that's the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive. So, that's the number of x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the answer should be 2865.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations, let me verify the initial bounds again. So, x must be greater than 0.0001, which implies 1/x < 10000. Similarly, x < 0.001 implies 1/x > 1000. So, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, 1000 < 1/x < 10000. Then, since 1/x = n\u03c0, we have 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.

So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.

Solving for x, we get x = 1/(n\u03c0). The interval (0.0001, 0.001) translates to 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, leading to n ranging from 319 to 3183. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

Solving for n gives n between approximately 318.31 and 3183.098. The integers n range from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.6894 \u2248 0.0001000031. So, yes, it's just a bit over 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, for n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477796, 19\u03c0 \u2248 59.69026042, so total \u2248 942.477796 + 59.69026042 \u2248 1002.168056. So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.168056 \u2248 0.00099785, which is less than 0.001, so it's included as well. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving x values within the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Wait, but let me make sure that 3183 is indeed the correct upper bound. Let me check n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001000031, which is just above 0.0001, so included. What about n=3184: x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22481/(3184*3.1415926535)\u22481/(10002.7205)\u22480.000099973, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded from the interval. So, n=3184 gives x below 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the upper bound for n is 3183. Similarly, for n=318: x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22481/(1000.272)\u22480.00099973, which is just below 0.001, so it's included in the interval. Wait, but earlier I thought n starts at 319. Wait, let me check n=318: x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.00099973, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But earlier, when solving the inequality, I found that n must be greater than approximately 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. Wait, but n=318 would give x\u22480.00099973, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Hmm, so perhaps my earlier calculation was slightly off. Let me re-examine the inequalities. Starting again: We have 0.0001 < x < 0.001, and x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let's solve for n in both inequalities.\n\nFirst inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n\u03c0 < 10000 \u21d2 n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886.\n\nSecond inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u21d2 n\u03c0 > 1000 \u21d2 n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 318.309886 < n < 3183.09886.\n\nSince n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183.\n\nWait, but when n=318, n=318 is less than 318.309886? No, 318 is less than 318.309886, so n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.00099973, which is less than 0.001, but does it satisfy the first inequality? Let's see: x=0.00099973 is greater than 0.0001, so it does satisfy 0.0001 < x < 0.001. So, why did the inequality say n > 318.309886? Because from 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, we have n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248318.309886. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886, so the smallest integer n is 319. Therefore, n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.00099973, which is within the interval, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309886, so n=318 is less than that and thus excluded. Wait, that seems contradictory because n=318 gives x\u22480.00099973, which is within the interval. So, perhaps my initial approach is incorrect. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the inequality 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248318.309886, so n must be greater than 318.309886, so the smallest integer n is 319. Therefore, n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.00099973, which is less than 0.001, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309886, so n=318 is less than that and thus excluded. Wait, but that would mean that x=1/(318\u03c0) is outside the interval, but in reality, x=0.00099973 is within (0.0001, 0.001). So, perhaps the mistake is that the inequality n > 318.309886 is correct, but n=318 is less than that, so it's excluded, even though x=1/(318\u03c0) is within the interval. That can't be right because x=1/(318\u03c0) is indeed within the interval, so n=318 should be included. Therefore, perhaps my earlier approach is flawed.\n\nWait, let's approach this differently. Let me solve the inequalities correctly.\n\nGiven 0.0001 < x < 0.001, and x = 1/(n\u03c0).\n\nSo, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nLet's invert all parts, remembering that inverting reverses the inequalities:\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001.\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nThen, dividing all parts by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nCalculating:\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886\n\n10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098862\n\nSo, n must satisfy 318.309886 < n < 3183.098862.\n\nSince n must be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319, and the largest is 3183.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that n=318 gives x\u22480.00099973, which is within the interval, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309886, so n=318 is less than that and thus excluded. So, perhaps n=318 is excluded because n must be greater than 318.309886, even though x=1/(318\u03c0) is within the interval. That seems contradictory, but mathematically, according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309886, so n=318 is excluded. Therefore, the first valid n is 319, which gives x\u22480.0009965, which is just below 0.001, but still within the interval. Wait, but 0.0009965 is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, perhaps n=319 is the first n that satisfies both inequalities. Therefore, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183, giving 2865 intercepts.\n\nWait, but to confirm, let me check n=318: x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.00099973, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. But according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309886, so n=318 is less than that, hence excluded. So, x=1/(318\u03c0) is within the interval, but n=318 is excluded because n must be greater than 318.309886. Therefore, n=318 is excluded, even though x is within the interval. That seems odd, but mathematically, that's correct because n must be greater than approximately 318.309886. Therefore, n=319 is the first integer that satisfies n > 318.309886, so n=319 is included.\n\nSimilarly, n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001000031, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. If n were 3184, x would be 1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.000099973, which is less than 0.0001, so excluded.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers n is from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the calculation 3183 - 319 +1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 -19=2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001  \n\u21d2 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000  \n\u21d2 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0  \n\u2248 318.31 < n < 3183.098\n\nn ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.6894 \u2248 0.000100003. So, that's just over 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3184*3.1415926535) \u2248 Let's see, 3184 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2248 9999.6894 + 3.14159 \u2248 10002.83099. So, 1/10002.83099 \u2248 0.0000999715, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, n=3183 is the largest n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. So, n=319 to n=3183 inclusive. So, the count is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Wait, but let me make sure that when I subtract 3183 - 319, I get 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, that seems correct.

So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.6894 \u2248 0.0001000031. So, yes, that's just above 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=319: x = 1/(319\u03c0). Let's compute 319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477796, 19\u03c0 \u2248 59.69026, so total \u2248 942.477796 + 59.69026 \u2248 1002.168056.

Wait, but let me confirm the calculation of 3183 - 319 +1. 3183 minus 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. That seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Therefore, the answer should be 2865. But wait, just to make sure, let me consider the function y = sin(1/x). As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is quite close to zero, the function oscillates a lot. Each oscillation corresponds to a half-period, so each zero crossing is when 1/x increases by \u03c0. So, the number of zeros is roughly the number of times 1/x can increase by \u03c0 as x goes from 0.001 to 0.0001. Wait, but in our case, x is decreasing from 0.001 to 0.0001, so 1/x is increasing from 1000 to 10000. So, the number of zeros would be the number of times 1/x passes through n\u03c0, where n is an integer, between 1000 and 10000. Wait, 1/x goes from 1000 to 10000 as x goes from 0.001 to 0.0001. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n where n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000. Wait, but that's a different way to think about it. So, n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000. So, n must be between 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, same as before. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Therefore, I can be confident that the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n.

So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.6894 \u2248 0.000100003. So, that's just a bit more than 0.0001, which is 0.0001 exactly. So, 0.000100003 is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 is included. Similarly, n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477796, 19\u03c0 \u2248 59.6902604, so total \u2248 942.477796 + 59.6902604 \u2248 1002.168056. So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.168056 \u2248 0.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so it's included as well. So, both n=319 and n=3183 give x within the interval. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is indeed 2865. Wait, but let me think again: when n increases by 1, x decreases by 1/(n+1)\u03c0 - 1/(n\u03c0). But since we're dealing with a continuous function, between each x-intercept, the function oscillates. But in this case, we're just counting the number of zeros, which correspond to the number of n's in that range. So, 2865 seems correct. Wait, but let me check the initial inequalities again. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and remembering to flip the inequalities because reciprocals reverse the order for positive numbers): 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Then, dividing by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098861 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098861. So, n must be integers strictly greater than 318.3098861 and strictly less than 3183.098861. So, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest is 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 +1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider n=319 and n=3183. For n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. For n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000100003, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, both ends are included, so the count is correct.
