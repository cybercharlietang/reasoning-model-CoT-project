Wait, but let me check if n=3183 is indeed the largest integer such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001.

Therefore, n=3183 is the largest n where x=1/(n\u03c0) is still greater than 0.0001.

Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the subtraction: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 gives 2865. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but just to make sure, let me check if n=3183 is indeed the last n where x > 0.0001. Let me compute n=3184: x=1/(3184\u03c0). 3184\u03c0 \u2248 3184 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3184 * 3 = 9552, 3184 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3184 * 0.1 = 318.4, 3184 * 0.04 = 127.36, 3184 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 approx 5.07. So, adding up: 318.4 + 127.36 = 445.76 + 5.07 \u2248 450.83. So total 3184\u03c0 \u2248 9552 + 450.83 \u2248 999, 9552 + 450.83 = 10002.83. So, 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/10002.83 \u2248 0.00009997, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included in the interval. Therefore, n=3184 gives x=0.00009997, which is below 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3183. Similarly, n=318 gives x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.0) = 0.001, but since 318\u03c0 \u2248 1000.0, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.001. But our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), open, so x cannot be exactly 0.001. Therefore, n=318 would give x=0.001, which is excluded. So, the next integer is n=319, which gives x\u22480.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Therefore, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, giving 2865 x-intercepts. So, I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me think about the function y = sin(1/x). As x approaches 0 from the positive side, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates increasingly rapidly between -1 and 1. So, near x=0, the function has infinitely many oscillations, but in our case, we're looking at x between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a very small interval near zero. However, in this interval, the function will cross the x-axis every time 1/x increases by \u03c0, which corresponds to x decreasing by 1/(n\u03c0). So, the number of zeros in that interval is indeed given by the number of integers n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) lies within (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the count is 2865. I think that's correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) crosses the x-axis whenever \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\), which occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for integer \\( n \\).

Similarly, for n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 1003.5, so 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so it's included as well. So, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive give x in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Wait, but let me check if 3183\u03c0 is exactly 10000. Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0: 3183 * \u03c0 = 3183 * 3.141592653589793 \u2248 Let me compute 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.141592653589793 \u2248 Let's compute 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.041592653589793 \u2248 Let's compute 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, 3183 * 0.001592653589793 \u2248 approx 3183 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0928. So, adding up: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.0928 \u2248 450.7128. So, total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9549 + 450.7128 \u2248 9999.7128. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.7128, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.7128 \u2248 0.0001000028, which is just over 0.0001. So, it's included in the interval. Similarly, n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 1003.5, so 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so included. Therefore, the count is correct at 2865. Wait, but let me think again: the function sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches zero. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is quite close to zero, the function oscillates rapidly. Each oscillation corresponds to a period of 2\u03c0 in the argument of the sine function. So, the number of oscillations between x = a and x = b is roughly (1/a - 1/b)/(2\u03c0). Wait, but in our case, the zeros occur every \u03c0 interval in the argument, so perhaps the number of zeros is approximately (1/(0.0001\u03c0) - 1/(0.001\u03c0)) / \u03c0? Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many times the argument 1/x crosses multiples of \u03c0 as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001. Each time 1/x passes through n\u03c0, we get a zero. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001). Which is exactly what we did earlier, leading to n from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 zeros. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the arithmetic for 3183 - 319 +1. 3183 - 319: Let me compute 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, 2864 +1 = 2865. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the number of integers between a and b inclusive is b - a +1. So, here a=319, b=3183, so 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about how many times 1/x crosses n\u03c0 between x=0.0001 and x=0.001, it's equivalent to the number of n's such that n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000. Because 1/x when x=0.001 is 1000, and when x=0.0001 is 10000. So, n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000. Therefore, n must be between 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, same as before. So, number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n.

Therefore, the count is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Wait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a miscalculation in the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Let me take a smaller example again. Suppose I have numbers from 5 to 8 inclusive. The numbers are 5,6,7,8: that's 4 numbers. Using the formula: 8 -5 +1 = 4, which is correct. Another example: from 10 to 12 inclusive: 10,11,12: 3 numbers. 12 -10 +1=3. So, applying that, 3183 - 319 +1=2865. So, that seems correct.

But wait, let me make sure there are no other x-intercepts in that interval. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches zero, with the oscillations becoming more frequent. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), the function will cross the x-axis every time 1/x increases by \u03c0. So, each crossing corresponds to an increase in 1/x by \u03c0, which corresponds to a decrease in x by a factor related to \u03c0. Therefore, the number of crossings should be approximately the difference in 1/(x\u03c0) between the two ends. Wait, but I think I've already accounted for that by considering n from 319 to 3183.

So, the count is from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Wait, but let me check the subtraction again. 3183 - 319: Let's compute 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2864 +1 = 2865. So, yes, 2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but just to make sure, let me think about how many times sin(1/x) crosses zero in that interval. Since sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly as x approaches zero, between 0.0001 and 0.001, it's going to oscillate a lot. Each oscillation corresponds to a zero crossing every \u03c0/(1/x) = x/\u03c0, but perhaps that's more complicated. Alternatively, since each zero crossing occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0), and we've found that there are 2865 such points between 0.0001 and 0.001, that seems plausible. Wait, but let me think: the interval from 0.0001 to 0.001 is 0.0009 in length. How does that relate to the number of zeros? Each zero is spaced by \u0394x = 1/(n\u03c0) - 1/((n+1)\u03c0) = (1/(n\u03c0)) - (1/(n+1)\u03c0) = (n+1 - n)/(n(n+1)\u03c0) = 1/(n(n+1)\u03c0). So, the spacing between consecutive zeros decreases as n increases. But perhaps that's not necessary here since we've already mapped the exact positions. So, I think my earlier calculation is correct: there are 2865 x-intercepts in that interval.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). For x in (0.0001, 0.001), n ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 intercepts.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

Therefore, n starts at 319, giving x \u2248 0.0009978, which is just under 0.001, so included. So, the range of n is from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 2865 integers.

Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 2865 x-intercepts. So, I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me consider if there's any possibility of overlapping or missing intercepts. Since sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely as x approaches 0, but in our case, x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a small interval near zero. So, the function will oscillate rapidly, crossing the x-axis each time 1/x increases by \u03c0. Each crossing corresponds to an increase in n by 1. So, the number of crossings should be roughly proportional to the change in 1/x divided by \u03c0. Let's compute 1/x at the endpoints: At x=0.001, 1/x=1000. At x=0.0001, 1/x=10000. So, the interval for 1/x is from 1000 to 10000. The number of zeros of sin(\u03b8) between \u03b8=1000 and \u03b8=10000 is the number of times \u03b8 crosses an integer multiple of \u03c0 in that interval. Each zero occurs at \u03b8 = n\u03c0, so the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Solving for n: n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, which is the same as before, giving 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865 zeros.

So, both n=319 and n=3183 give x-values within the interval, so they should be included. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is indeed 2865. Wait, but let me think again: when n increases by 1, x decreases by a certain amount. So, each n corresponds to exactly one x in the interval, so the count is correct. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 1/(n\u03c0) in that interval. Solving for n gives n from 319 to 3183, resulting in 2865 x-intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.6894 \u2248 0.0001000031, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477796 + 19\u03c0 \u2248 59.69026042 \u2248 942.477796 + 59.69026042 \u2248 1002.168056.

So, both endpoints are included in the interval, so n=319 and n=3183 are valid, and thus the count is 2865. Wait, but just to make sure, let me check if n=3184 would give x less than 0.0001. Let's compute x=1/(3184\u03c0). 3184\u03c0 \u2248 3184 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3000\u03c0\u22489424.77796, 184\u03c0\u2248184*3.1415926535\u2248180\u03c0\u2248565.48667 +4\u03c0\u224812.56637\u2248578.05304. So total 3184\u03c0\u22489424.77796 +578.05304\u22489999.83099. So, 1/(3184\u03c0)\u22481/9999.83099\u22480.0001000017, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. Wait, but wait, 3184 is larger than 3183, so x=1/(3184\u03c0) is smaller than x=1/(3183\u03c0). Wait, but 3183\u03c0\u22489999.6894, so 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001000031, and 3184\u03c0\u22489999.83099, so 1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0001000017. Wait, that seems inconsistent because as n increases, x decreases, so 1/(n\u03c0) should be decreasing. So, n=3183: x\u22480.0001000031, n=3184: x\u22480.0001000017, which is indeed smaller, so it's still above 0.0001. So, n=3184 would give x\u22480.0001000017, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Wait, but earlier I thought n goes up to 3183, but if n=3184 is still giving x>0.0001, then perhaps my upper limit is wrong. Wait, let me solve for n when x=0.0001 exactly. So, 1/(n\u03c0)=0.0001 \u2192 n=1/(0.0001\u03c0)=10000/\u03c0\u22483183.09886184. So, n must be less than 3183.09886184. So, the maximum integer n is 3183, because 3183 < 3183.09886184. So, n=3183 is allowed, but n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0)=\u22480.0001000017, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. Wait, but that contradicts the earlier calculation. Wait, no, because 1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0001000017 is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, that would imply that n can be up to 3183, but wait, 3183.09886184 is the exact value where x=0.0001. So, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so n=3183 is allowed because 3183 < 3183.09886184. But n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0)=\u22480.0001000017, which is still greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Wait, that can't be right because 3184 > 3183.09886184, which would mean x=1/(3184\u03c0) < 0.0001. Wait, but my calculation showed x=\u22480.0001000017, which is greater than 0.0001. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 3184\u03c0 more accurately. 3184 * \u03c0 \u2248 3184 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute 3000 * \u03c0 = 9424.77796, 184 * \u03c0 \u2248 184 * 3.1415926535. Let's compute 100\u03c0\u2248314.15926535, 80\u03c0\u2248251.32741229, 4\u03c0\u224812.56637061. So, 184\u03c0\u2248314.15926535 +251.32741229=565.48667764 +12.56637061\u2248578.05304825. So, total 3184\u03c0\u22489424.77796 +578.05304825\u22489999.83099. So, 1/(3184\u03c0)=1/9999.83099\u22480.0001000017. Wait, that's still greater than 0.0001. So, 0.0001000017 is just barely above 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3184 would also be included. But wait, according to the initial inequality, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so n=3183 is the maximum integer. But according to this calculation, n=3184 gives x\u22480.0001000017, which is still in the interval. So, perhaps my initial upper bound was wrong. Let me re-examine the inequality. The inequality is 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 and 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, solving for n: From 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001: n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0)=10000/\u03c0\u22483183.09886184. So, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so the maximum integer n is 3183. But wait, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)=\u22480.0001000031, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. When n=3184, x=1/(3184\u03c0)=\u22480.0001000017, which is still above 0.0001, so it's included. Wait, but 3184 > 3183.09886184, so n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0)=\u22480.0001000017, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's still within the interval. Wait, this suggests that n can go up to 3183, but n=3184 also gives x in the interval. So, perhaps my initial calculation was wrong. Let me think again: if n=3183, x\u22480.0001000031, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. n=3184: x\u22480.0001000017, which is still above 0.0001, so included. n=3185: x=1/(3185\u03c0)=\u22481/(3185*3.1415926535)=1/(10000.171)=\u22480.0000999983, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, n=3185 would give x=\u22480.0000999983, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included in the interval. Therefore, the maximum n is 3184, because n=3184 gives x\u22480.0001000017, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, my earlier upper limit was wrong. So, n can go up to 3184. Let me recalculate the number of integers from 319 to 3184 inclusive. So, the number of terms is 3184 - 319 +1 = 2866. Wait, that's different from before. So, where did I go wrong earlier? I think I miscalculated the maximum n. Let me solve 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which gives n < 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.09886184. So, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so the maximum integer n is 3183. But when n=3184, x=1/(3184\u03c0)=\u22480.0001000017, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. So, that suggests that n can be up to 3184, because x=1/(3184\u03c0) is still greater than 0.0001. Therefore, my initial upper bound was 3183, but actually, n can go up to 3184 because 3184 < 3183.09886184? Wait, no, 3184 is greater than 3183.09886184, so n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0)=\u22480.0001000017, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Wait, but 3184 > 3183.09886184, so n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0)=\u22480.0001000017, which is still greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, the maximum n is 3184. So, the number of integers is from 319 to 3184 inclusive. So, 3184 - 319 +1 = 2866. Wait, that's one more than before. So, I must have made a mistake earlier in determining the maximum n. Let me confirm with exact values.\n\nLet me compute n such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, n < 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.09886184. So, n can be up to 3183, because 3183 < 3183.09886184, but 3184 > 3183.09886184. So, n=3184 would give 1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0001000017, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, n can go up to 3184, even though 3184 > 3183.09886184, because 1/(3184\u03c0) is still greater than 0.0001. So, the maximum n is 3184. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3184 - 319 +1 = 2866.\n\nWait, but let me check with n=3184: x=1/(3184\u03c0)=\u22480.0001000017, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Similarly, n=3185: x=1/(3185\u03c0)=\u22480.0000999983, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3184. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3184 inclusive is 3184 - 319 +1 = 2866.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n=3183 was the maximum, but now it's 3184. Let me recast the problem.\n\nWe have x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x \u2208 (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nSo, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nCalculating:\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184\n\n10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, n must be an integer such that 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184.\n\nThus, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest integer n is 3183, because 3183 < 3183.09886184, but 3184 > 3183.09886184.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation showed that n=3184 gives x=1/(3184\u03c0)=\u22480.0001000017, which is still greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. Therefore, perhaps my initial inequality was wrong. Let me think again.\n\nIf n must be less than 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.09886184, then n can be up to 3183, because 3183 < 3183.09886184, but n=3184 would be greater than 3183.09886184, which would mean x=1/(3184\u03c0) < 0.0001, which contradicts the calculation where x=\u22480.0001000017>0.0001.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inequality direction. Let me solve 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 again.\n\n1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0 (positive, so inequality remains):\n\n1 > 0.0001 * n\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by 0.0001\u03c0:\n\n1 / (0.0001\u03c0) > n\n\nWhich is:\n\nn < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so the maximum integer n is 3183. Therefore, n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0)=\u22480.0001000017, which is greater than 0.0001, but according to the inequality, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so n=3184 is not allowed. Wait, that contradicts the calculation. So, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me compute 3184\u03c0 precisely.\n\n3184 * \u03c0 = 3184 * 3.141592653589793\n\nLet me compute 3000\u03c0=9424.77796076938\n\n184\u03c0=184*3.141592653589793= Let's compute:\n\n100\u03c0=314.1592653589793\n\n80\u03c0=251.32741228718345\n\n4\u03c0=12.566370614359172\n\nAdding up: 314.1592653589793 + 251.32741228718345 = 565.4866776461627 + 12.566370614359172 = 578.0530482605219\n\nSo, 3184\u03c0=9424.77796076938 + 578.0530482605219= 9999.830999029901\n\nThus, 1/(3184\u03c0)=1/9999.830999029901\u22480.000100001700003\n\nWhich is approximately 0.0001000017, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3184 is allowed, even though 3184 > 3183.09886184.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory. Because according to the inequality, n must be less than 3183.09886184, but n=3184 is greater than that and yet gives x=1/(3184\u03c0)=\u22480.0001000017>0.0001.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is in the inequality direction. Let me re-express the inequality:\n\nWe have x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001\n\nSo, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 > 0.0001 * n\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by 0.0001\u03c0: 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) > n\n\nWhich is n < 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.09886184\n\nSo, n must be less than 3183.09886184, which means the maximum integer n is 3183. Therefore, n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0)=\u22480.0001000017>0.0001, but according to the inequality, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so n=3184 is not allowed. But according to the calculation, x=1/(3184\u03c0)=\u22480.0001000017>0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, perhaps the inequality is not strict in the way I thought. Maybe I should consider that n can be up to the floor of 10000/\u03c0, which is 3183, because 3183 < 10000/\u03c0 < 3184. So, n=3183 is allowed, but n=3184 is not. Therefore, the maximum n is 3183.\n\nWait, but in that case, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)=\u22480.0001000031>0.0001, which is included. When n=3184, x=1/(3184\u03c0)=\u22480.0001000017>0.0001, which is included, but according to the inequality, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so n=3184 is not allowed. Therefore, the confusion arises because 3184\u03c0\u22489999.831, which is just less than 10000, so 1/(3184\u03c0)=\u22480.0001000017>0.0001. So, even though n=3184>3183.09886184, x=1/(3184\u03c0) is still greater than 0.0001. Therefore, perhaps the correct way is to consider that n can go up to the floor of 10000/\u03c0, which is 3183, because 3183\u03c0\u22489999.6894<10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0)=\u22480.0001000031>0.0001, which is included. But n=3184\u03c0\u22489999.831<10000, so 1/(3184\u03c0)=\u22480.0001000017>0.0001, which is still included, but n=3184>3183.09886184. Therefore, perhaps the initial inequality is not correctly capturing the upper bound. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that n can be up to the integer part of 10000/\u03c0, which is 3183, because 3183.09886184 is not an integer, so the maximum integer n is 3183. Therefore, n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0)=\u22480.0001000017>0.0001, but since n must be less than 3183.09886184, n=3184 is not allowed, even though x is still in the interval. Therefore, the correct maximum n is 3183, and the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 +1=2865.\n\nBut wait, this contradicts the calculation where n=3184 gives x=\u22480.0001000017>0.0001, which is included. So, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that n can be from 319 up to the largest integer n where 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, solving for n:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001\n\nn < 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.09886184\n\nSo, the maximum integer n is 3183, because 3183 < 3183.09886184, and 3184 > 3183.09886184. Therefore, n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0)=\u22480.0001000017>0.0001, but since n must be less than 3183.09886184, n=3184 is not allowed. Therefore, the maximum n is 3183, and the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 +1=2865.\n\nWait, but if n=3184 is allowed because x=\u22480.0001000017>0.0001, then perhaps the initial inequality is not correctly capturing the upper bound. Maybe the correct way is to take the floor of 10000/\u03c0, which is 3183, and include n=3184 if x=1/(3184\u03c0) is still greater than 0.0001. Since x=\u22480.0001000017>0.0001, n=3184 is allowed. Therefore, the maximum n is 3184, and the number of x-intercepts is 3184 - 319 +1=2866.\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether to include n=3184 or not. Given that 1/(3184\u03c0)=\u22480.0001000017>0.0001, it should be included, even though n=3184>3183.09886184. Therefore, the correct count is 2866.\n\nBut let me check with n=3184:\n\nx=1/(3184\u03c0)=\u22480.0001000017>0.0001, so it's included.\n\nn=3185: x=1/(3185\u03c0)=\u22480.0000999983<0.0001, so excluded.\n\nTherefore, the maximum n is 3184, so the count is from 319 to 3184 inclusive.\n\nNumber of terms: 3184 - 319 +1=2866.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2866.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n=3184 was not allowed because n must be less than 3183.09886184, but since x=1/(3184\u03c0) is still greater than 0.0001, it should be included. Therefore, the correct count is 2866.\n\nSo, to summarize, the number of x-intercepts is 2866.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure by considering the exact values.\n\nCompute 3183.09886184 * \u03c0: 3183.09886184 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 10000.000000000001.\n\nSo, 3183.09886184 * \u03c0 \u224810000.000000000001.\n\nTherefore, 1/(3183.09886184 * \u03c0)=\u22480.0001.\n\nSo, x=1/(n\u03c0)=0.0001 when n=3183.09886184.\n\nTherefore, for n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)=\u22480.0001000031>0.0001.\n\nFor n=3184, x=1/(3184\u03c0)=\u22480.0001000017>0.0001.\n\nFor n=3185, x=1/(3185\u03c0)=\u22480.0000999983<0.0001.\n\nTherefore, n=3184 is allowed because x>0.0001, so the maximum n is 3184.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers from 319 to 3184 inclusive is 3184 - 319 +1=2866.\n\nThus, the number of x-intercepts is 2866.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). To find x in (0.0001, 0.001), solve 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. This gives n between approximately 319 and 3184. The number of integers from 319 to 3184 inclusive is 3184 - 319 + 1 = 2866.\n\n$\\boxed{2866}$"

So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, from 319 to 3183, that's 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that all these x values are indeed in the interval. So, for each n from 319 to 3183, x=1/(n\u03c0) is between 0.0001 and 0.001. As we saw, n=319 gives x\u22480.0009965 < 0.001, and n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001000031 > 0.0001. So, yes, all these x's are within the interval.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is there a possibility that some x's might coincide or something? No, because each n gives a unique x, as x=1/(n\u03c0), and since n is an integer, each x is unique.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the function y = sin(1/x). As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. So, between x=0.0001 and x=0.001, which is a small interval near zero, the function oscillates a lot, crossing the x-axis each time 1/x increases by \u03c0. So, the number of zeros is roughly the number of times 1/x increases by \u03c0 as x goes from 0.001 to 0.0001.\n\nWait, actually, as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000. So, the change in 1/x is from 10000 to 1000, a decrease of 9000. Each zero occurs when 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0, so the number of zeros is approximately the number of \u03c0 intervals in the range from 1000 to 10000.\n\nWait, that might be another way to think about it. The number of zeros would be the number of times 1/x passes through each integer multiple of \u03c0 as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001. So, the total change in 1/x is 10000 - 1000 = 9000. The distance between consecutive zeros is \u03c0, so the number of zeros would be approximately 9000 / \u03c0, which is about 2866. But that's close to our previous count of 2865. So, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but why the slight difference? Because when we calculated n from 319 to 3183, that gave us 2865, but 9000 / \u03c0 \u2248 2866.4. Hmm, that's a discrepancy of one. Maybe because when we take the floor or ceiling, it can differ by one. Let me check: 9000 / \u03c0 \u2248 2866.419, so the integer part is 2866, but our count was 2865. So, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the initial inequalities. So, x must be in (0.0001, 0.001), so 1/(n\u03c0) must be in that interval. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Therefore, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, dividing by \u03c0, we get 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating these: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098861, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098861. Therefore, n must be integers greater than 318.3098861 and less than 3183.098861. So, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest integer n is 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that's 2865 integers. But when I thought about the total change being 9000, and dividing by \u03c0, I get approximately 2866.419, which suggests 2866 zeros. But according to the precise calculation, it's 2865. So, perhaps the approximation is slightly off because we're dealing with open intervals and exact endpoints.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is whether the endpoints are included or not. Since the interval is open, we don't include x=0.0001 or x=0.001, so the corresponding n's that would give exactly x=0.0001 or x=0.001 are excluded. So, n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001000031, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. Similarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.0009965, which is just below 0.001, so it's included. Therefore, the count is correct at 2865.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approximation method counts an extra zero because it includes both endpoints, but in reality, since the interval is open, we don't include those, so the count is one less than the approximation. So, 2866.419 rounded down is 2866, but our precise count is 2865. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the approximation. Wait, let me think: the total change in 1/x is from 1000 to 10000, which is 9000. Each zero occurs every \u03c0 units, so the number of zeros would be the number of \u03c0 intervals in 9000. So, 9000 / \u03c0 \u2248 2866.419. But since we're starting just above 1000 and ending just below 10000, perhaps we have one fewer zero than the approximation suggests. So, 2866.419 would suggest 2866 zeros, but since the interval is open, maybe it's 2865. That seems consistent with our precise calculation.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me just check with a smaller example to make sure my method is correct. Suppose I have the interval (0.01, 0.1). Let's find the number of x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in this interval.\n\nFirst, x must satisfy 0.01 < x < 0.1. So, 1/x must satisfy 10 < 1/x < 100. So, 1/x is between 10 and 100. The zeros occur at 1/x = n\u03c0, so n\u03c0 must be between 10 and 100. So, n must satisfy 10 < n\u03c0 < 100. Therefore, n must be greater than 10/\u03c0 \u2248 3.183 and less than 100/\u03c0 \u2248 31.831. So, n ranges from 4 to 31 inclusive. The number of integers from 4 to 31 is 31 - 4 + 1 = 28. Let me verify this by considering that each n from 4 to 31 gives an x = 1/(n\u03c0) in (0.01, 0.1). For n=4: x=1/(4\u03c0)\u22480.079577, which is between 0.01 and 0.1. For n=31: x=1/(31\u03c0)\u22480.010127, which is just above 0.01, so included in the open interval. So, the count is 28. Alternatively, using the approximation method: the change in 1/x is from 100 to 10, which is 90. Divided by \u03c0, that's 90/\u03c0 \u2248 28.66, which would suggest 28 zeros, matching our precise count. So, in this case, the approximation matches the precise count. Therefore, in our original problem, the approximation gave us about 2866.419, but the precise count is 2865, which is one less. That might be because in the smaller example, the interval (0.01, 0.1) excludes the endpoints, but the number of zeros is still 28, which is consistent with the approximation. So, perhaps in our original problem, the precise count is 2865, which is consistent with the method.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we start by noting that the sine function is zero when its argument is an integer multiple of \\( \\pi \\).

So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.6894 \u2248 0.000100003. So, yes, it's just over 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 is included, and similarly, n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so included as well. Therefore, the count from n=319 to n=3183 is correct, giving 2865 x-intercepts. Wait, but let me think again: the function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches zero. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is quite close to zero, the function will oscillate rapidly. Each oscillation corresponds to a period of 2\u03c0 in terms of \u03b8, where \u03b8 = 1/x. So, as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001, \u03b8 increases from 1000 to 10000. The number of zeros in this interval would be roughly the number of times \u03b8 crosses multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. So, the number of zeros would be approximately (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 \u2248 9000/3.1416 \u2248 2866. But wait, that's close to our earlier count of 2865. Hmm, but why the slight difference? Because when we count from n=319 to n=3183, we get 2865, but the approximate calculation gives 2866. Let me check the exact numbers. So, \u03b8 starts at 1000 and ends at 10000. The number of zeros is the number of integers n such that n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating those: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, the exact count is 2865, which aligns with our earlier calculation. The approximate method gave 2866 because it was (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.226, which is roughly 2866, but the exact count is 2865. So, that's why there's a slight discrepancy. Therefore, the exact number of zeros is 2865. So, I think that's the answer. To recap: For each integer n, sin(1/x) = 0 at x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), which translates to n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. The number of integers in that range is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, leading to x = 1/(n\u03c0). For x in (0.0001, 0.001), n ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 intercepts.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify where sin(1/x) = 0**: This occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0, where n is an integer.

Therefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.68941 \u2248 0.0001000031. So, that's just a bit over 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n=3183 is included. Similarly, n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 1003.5, so 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so included. So, the count is indeed from n=319 to n=3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is there a possibility that some n's could result in x outside the interval? For example, if n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.0) \u2248 0.001, but since our interval is up to 0.001 exclusive, n=318 would give x\u22480.001, which is not included. So, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. Similarly, n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001000031, which is just above 0.0001, so included. Therefore, the count is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that's the number of x-intercepts. Hmm, seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach this is to consider how many times 1/x crosses each multiple of \u03c0 as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001. Each time 1/x passes through n\u03c0, sin(1/x) crosses zero. So, the number of zeros is equal to the number of integer n's such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001). So, same as before, n ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 zeros.\n\nWait, but let me check: when x is in (0.0001, 0.001), 1/x is in (1000, 10000). So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. Therefore, sin(1/x) will cross zero every time 1/x passes through an integer multiple of \u03c0. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n must be in (1000/\u03c0, 10000/\u03c0), which is approximately (318.309, 3183.098). So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865 zeros.\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I found earlier. So, I think the answer is 2865.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, let me think about it differently. Let's consider the function y = sin(1/x). As x approaches 0 from the positive side, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. But in our case, x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, so 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, sin(1/x) oscillates between -1 and 1, crossing zero each time 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0. So, the number of zeros is the number of multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000.\n\nSo, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that n\u03c0 is in (1000, 10000). So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which is equivalent to 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. As before, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, giving 2865 integers. Therefore, 2865 zeros.\n\nI think that's solid.

Since sin(1/x) is periodic with period 2\u03c0, but as x approaches zero, the function oscillates more and more rapidly. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), the function will cross the x-axis every time 1/x increases by \u03c0, which corresponds to x decreasing by 1/(n\u03c0). So, each integer n gives exactly one x-intercept in that interval. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is equal to the number of integers n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which we found to be 2865. So, I think that's the solution.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n gives 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

    "text": "7 + 3 * \u03c0 \u2248 9.4247777 \u2248 574.911454 So total is 9424.77796 + 574.911454 \u2248 9999.689414. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.689414, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.689414 \u2248 0.00010000312. So, that's approximately 0.00010000312, which is just a bit above 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, for n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477796, 19\u03c0 \u2248 59.6902604, so total \u2248 942.477796 + 59.6902604 \u2248 1002.168056. So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.168056 \u2248 0.00099785, which is less than 0.001, so it's included as well. Therefore, n=319 gives x\u22480.00099785, which is within the interval, and n=3183 gives x\u22480.00010000312, which is also within the interval. So, the count from n=319 to n=3183 inclusive is correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Wait, but let me check if n=3183 is the last n where x is still greater than 0.0001. Since 3183\u03c0 \u22489999.689414, so 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00010000312>0.0001, so yes, it's included. If I take n=3184, then 3184\u03c0\u22483184*3.1415926535\u2248 Let me compute 3000\u03c0=9424.77796, 184\u03c0\u2248184*3.1415926535\u2248 180\u03c0\u2248565.486677, 4\u03c0\u224812.56637061, so total\u2248565.486677+12.56637061\u2248578.0530477. So, 3000\u03c0+184\u03c0\u22489424.77796+578.0530477\u2248999, 24.77796+578.0530477=999, 9424.77796+578.0530477=999, let me add 9424.77796 + 578.0530477: 9424 + 578 = 999, but wait, 9424.77796 + 578.0530477 = 999, 9424 + 578 = 999, but actually, 9424.77796 + 578.0530477 = 999, 9424.77796 + 578.0530477 = 999, but wait, 9424.77796 + 578.0530477 = 999, 9424.77796 + 578.0530477 = 999, but actually, 9424.77796 + 578.0530477 = 999, but that can't be right because 9424 + 578 = 999, but 9424.77796 + 578.0530477 = 999, but that's not correct. Wait, 9424.77796 + 578.0530477 = 999, but that's not correct because 9424 + 578 = 999, but 9424.77796 + 578.0530477 = 999, which would be 999, but that can't be right because 9424 + 578 = 999, but 9424.77796 + 578.0530477 = 999, which is impossible because 9424 + 578 = 999, but that's only 999 units, but 9424.77796 is over 9000, so adding 578.0530477 would give 999, which is way too low. Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try again: 3184\u03c0 = 3183\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u22489999.689414 + 3.1415926535\u22489999.689414 + 3.1415926535\u224810002.8309. So, 3184\u03c0\u224810002.8309, so 1/(3184\u03c0)\u22481/10002.8309\u22480.0000999715, which is less than 0.0001, so x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0000999715, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3184 would give x\u22480.0000999715, which is below 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3183, as previously determined. Similarly, let's check n=318: 318\u03c0\u2248318*3.1415926535\u2248 Let's compute 300\u03c0\u2248942.477796, 18\u03c0\u224856.5486677, so total\u2248942.477796+56.5486677\u2248999.0264637. So, 1/(318\u03c0)\u22481/999.0264637\u22480.001000974, which is greater than 0.001, so x=0.001000974 is outside the interval (0.0001, 0.001), so n=318 is excluded. Therefore, n must start at 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865 x-intercepts. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, because sometimes when dealing with approximations, things can get a bit off. Let me re-express the inequalities without approximating \u03c0.\n\nSo, the inequalities are:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing all parts by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nCalculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184\n\nAnd 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nTherefore, n must satisfy:\n\n318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184\n\nSince n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I found earlier. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\). This occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for some integer \\( n \\), which implies \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n\nWe need \\( x \\) to satisfy \\( 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\). This can be rewritten as:\n\\[ 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\]\n\nRewriting these inequalities:\n\\[ 1000 < n\\pi < 10000 \\]\n\nDividing by \\( \\pi \\):\n\\[ \\frac{1000}{\\pi} < n < \\frac{10000}{\\pi} \\]\n\nApproximating the bounds:\n\\[ \\frac{1000}{\\pi} \\approx 318.309886184 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{10000}{\\pi} \\approx 3183.09886184 \\]\n\nThus, \\( n \\) must be an integer in the range from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers in this range is:\n\\[ 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts is \\(\\boxed{2865}\\)."

So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.68941, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.68941 \u2248 0.0001000031, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001).

So, both endpoints are included, so our count from n=319 to n=3183 inclusive is correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me check if n=3183 is indeed the last n before x drops below 0.0001. Wait, if n=3184, then x=1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3184 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10002.75) \u2248 0.00009997, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. So, n=3183 is the largest n such that x > 0.0001. Similarly, n=318: x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.0) \u2248 0.001, but since 318\u03c0 \u2248 1000.0, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.001 exactly, but since our interval is open, x=0.001 is excluded. So, n=318 would give x=0.001, which is not included, so the smallest n is 319, giving x\u22480.00099784, which is included. So, yes, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. I think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The function y = sin(1/x) has zeros where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x=1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n gives 318.309 < n < 3183.098. Since n must be integer, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.
