    "text": " => 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. Taking reciprocals (and remembering to flip the inequality sign because both sides are positive), we get: n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001 => n\u03c0 < 10000. Similarly, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals again: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001 => n\u03c0 > 1000. So now, we have two inequalities: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. To find the range of n, I can divide all parts by \u03c0. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me calculate these values. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, the smallest integer n can be is 319 (since 318.309... is just above 318, so the next integer is 319), and the largest integer n can be is 3183 (since 3183.098... is just below 3184, so the integer part is 3183). Now, to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, no, actually, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that. 3183 - 319 is 2864, and then adding 1 gives 2865. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculation. 3183 minus 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more to get 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, so that suggests there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial setup. So, we have x = 1/(n\u03c0), and x needs to be between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing by \u03c0, we get 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we determine when \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\).

    "text": " => 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. To solve for n, I can take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that taking reciprocals reverses the inequality since both sides are positive. So, n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating 1/0.0001, that's 10000. So, n\u03c0 < 10000 => n < 10000/\u03c0. Similarly, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, take reciprocals, flipping the inequality: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001 => n\u03c0 > 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Now, let me compute the numerical values for these. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so let me calculate 10000/\u03c0 and 1000/\u03c0. 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. Similarly, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. But n has to be an integer because it's in the equation 1/x = n\u03c0. So, n must be an integer such that 318.309886 < n < 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, applying that here, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait a second, let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let me check the range again. When x is 0.001, 1/x is 1000, and when x is 0.0001, 1/x is 10000. So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000 in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, sin(1/x) will have zeros at each multiple of \u03c0 in that interval. So, the zeros occur at 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, for x to be in (0.0001, 0.001), 1/(n\u03c0) must be between 0.0001 and 0.001, which implies that n must be between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, as I found earlier. So, n is from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which gives 2865 integers. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that makes sense. Let me just think if there's any other consideration I might have missed. For example, does the function sin(1/x) oscillate more as x approaches zero? Yes, but in this case, our interval is between 0.0001 and 0.001, so we're not going all the way to zero, but still, the function will oscillate rapidly as x approaches 0.0001. But since we're only counting the zeros in that interval, each zero corresponds to an n, so each integer n in that range corresponds to exactly one x-intercept. So, I think my reasoning is correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we determine where \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\).

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. If I have 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, then taking reciprocals (and flipping the inequality since all terms are positive), I get n\u03c0 > 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Similarly, for 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0), taking reciprocals gives n\u03c0 < 10000, so n < 10000/\u03c0. So, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Now, let me compute these values numerically. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n can take values from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, 3183 - 318 = 2865, and then 2865 + 1 = 2866. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my reasoning again. So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31, so the smallest integer n is 319. Similarly, n must be less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so the largest integer n is 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, so that's 2865 integers. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me think again. Each integer n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, the number of x-intercepts is equal to the number of integers n in that range. So, if n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, 2865 x-intercepts. But wait, I'm a bit confused because the interval is from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is a small range near zero, but the function sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely as x approaches zero. So, in this interval, it's oscillating very rapidly, leading to many zeros. So, 2865 seems plausible, but let me check if I did the calculations correctly. Let me compute 1000/\u03c0 more accurately. 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 318.309886184. So, the next integer is 319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 is approximately 3183.09886184, so the integer part is 3183. So, n runs from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that step by step: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then 2864 + 1 is 2865. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), we have 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let's solve for n in each inequality. First inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Multiply both sides by n\u03c0 (positive, so inequality remains the same): 0.0001 * n\u03c0 < 1. Then, divide both sides by 0.0001: n\u03c0 < 1 / 0.0001 => n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be less than this, so n \u2264 3183. Second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Multiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0. Then, divide both sides by 0.001: n\u03c0 > 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184. So, n must be greater than this, so n \u2265 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct.

Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n must be an integer strictly greater than approximately 318.309886184 and strictly less than approximately 3183.09886184. So, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, applying that here: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check my subtraction: 3183 minus 319. Let me compute 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. So, 2864 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, but wait, let me think again. If n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183, how many terms are there? So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, which is the difference between the upper and lower bounds. But since both endpoints are included, we add 1. So, 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, that would mean there are 2865 integer values of n, each corresponding to an x-intercept in the given interval. Wait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Let me take a smaller example to verify. Suppose I have n from 2 to 5. Then, 5 - 2 = 3, but the numbers are 2,3,4,5, which is 4 numbers. So, 5 - 2 +1 = 4. So, yes, the formula is correct. So, in this case, 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts. But wait, let me check if 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Let's compute 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000.00000000001) \u2248 0.0001. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but since n is 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is just slightly above 0.0001, right? Because 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 is just over 10000, 1/(3183\u03c0) is just under 0.0001. Wait, hold on, that might not be right. Wait, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 10000.00000000001. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 exactly, but since 3183\u03c0 is just over 10000, 1/(3183\u03c0) is just under 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is just less than 0.0001, which is the lower bound of the interval. So, does that mean that n = 3183 gives x = 1/(3183\u03c0) which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval? Wait, that contradicts my earlier calculation. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the inequality was 0.0001 < x < 0.001, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, x = 1/(n\u03c0) must satisfy 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, solving for n:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001 \u21d2 n\u03c0 < 10000 \u21d2 n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u21d2 n\u03c0 > 1000 \u21d2 n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184.\n\nSo, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184.\n\nSince n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, because 3183 is less than 3183.09886184, so 3183 is included. Wait, but 3183 is less than 3183.09886184, so n can be 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, which would mean it's not included. But according to the inequality, x must be greater than 0.0001. So, let's check if x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001.\n\nCompute 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.00000000001) \u2248 0.0001 exactly. But since 3183\u03c0 is just over 10000, 1/(3183\u03c0) is just under 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, which is the lower bound. Therefore, n=3183 gives x just below 0.0001, which is outside the interval. So, n=3183 is not included. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) would be greater than 0.0001.\n\nWait, let me compute 3182 * \u03c0. 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796077, 182\u03c0 \u2248 182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 571.83643585. So, total is approximately 9424.77796077 + 571.83643585 \u2248 10,  let me add 9424.77796077 + 571.83643585: 9424 + 571 = 9995, and 0.77796077 + 0.83643585 \u2248 1.6144, so total \u2248 9995 + 1.6144 \u2248 9996.6144. So, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9996.6144, so 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.6144 \u2248 approximately 0.000100033, which is just over 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100033, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval.\n\nSimilarly, n=3183 gives x \u2248 0.0001 exactly, but since 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.00000000001, so x \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001. So, x=0.0001 is excluded, so n=3183 is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nSimilarly, let's check the lower end. The lower bound is n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so the smallest integer n is 319.\n\nNow, let's compute the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nSo, 3182 - 319 + 1 = ?\n\nCompute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863. Then, 2863 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, that seems different from before. So, earlier I thought it was 2865, but now it's 2864. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me take a small example again. Suppose I have n from 2 to 5 inclusive. The numbers are 2,3,4,5: that's 4 numbers. 5 - 2 +1 = 4, which is correct.\n\nSo, if I have from 319 to 3182 inclusive, the count is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n=3183 was excluded, so the upper limit is 3182, so the count is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded, so n=3183 is not included, so the upper n is 3182.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864.\n\nBut wait, let me compute 3182 - 319:\n\n3182 - 300 = 2882\n\n2882 - 19 = 2863\n\nThen 2863 +1 = 2864.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, which is it?\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether n=3183 is included or not. Since x=1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001, so x=0.0001 is excluded. Therefore, n=3183 is excluded, so the maximum n is 3182.\n\nThus, the number of x-intercepts is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another approach. Let's compute the exact values.\n\nCompute n_min = floor(1000/\u03c0) +1. 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so floor(318.309886184) = 318, so n_min = 319.\n\nn_max = floor(10000/\u03c0) -1. 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so floor(3183.09886184) = 3183, so n_max = 3183 -1 = 3182.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check if 1/(3182\u03c0) is indeed greater than 0.0001.\n\nCompute 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796077, 182\u03c0 \u2248 571.83643585, so total \u2248 9424.77796077 + 571.83643585 \u2248 9996.6144.\n\nSo, 1/(9996.6144) \u2248 0.000100033, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nSimilarly, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.00000000001) \u2248 0.0001 exactly, but since 3183\u03c0 is just over 10000, 1/(3183\u03c0) is just under 0.0001, which is excluded.\n\nTherefore, n_max = 3182.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but after correcting for n=3183 being excluded, it's 2864.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the number of zeros between x=0.0001 and x=0.001.\n\nEach zero occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0), so the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWhich is equivalent to n being in (1000/\u03c0, 10000/\u03c0).\n\nSo, n must be integers strictly greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 and strictly less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, but wait, no, because 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so n=3183 is excluded. So, n goes up to 3182.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers is from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864.\n\nSo, the answer should be 2864.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a miscalculation in the subtraction.\n\nCompute 3182 - 319:\n\n3182 - 300 = 2882\n\n2882 - 19 = 2863\n\nThen, 2863 +1 = 2864.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nBut wait, let me think about the function y = sin(1/x). As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a very small interval near zero, the function still oscillates very rapidly. Each oscillation corresponds to a period of 2\u03c0 in the argument of the sine function. So, the number of zeros in this interval would be approximately the number of times the sine function completes a cycle as x moves from 0.001 to 0.0001.\n\nWait, but perhaps another way to think about it is to consider the change in \u03b8 = 1/x as x moves from 0.001 to 0.0001. So, when x = 0.001, \u03b8 = 1000. When x = 0.0001, \u03b8 = 10000. So, \u03b8 goes from 1000 to 10000. The sine function has a zero every \u03c0 units in \u03b8. So, the number of zeros would be the number of \u03c0 intervals between 1000 and 10000.\n\nSo, the number of zeros is the number of times \u03b8 crosses a multiple of \u03c0 between \u03b8=1000 and \u03b8=10000.\n\nSo, the first zero after \u03b8=1000 is at \u03b8=1000 + (\u03c0 - (1000 mod \u03c0)). But perhaps it's easier to compute the number of zeros as floor(10000/\u03c0) - floor(1000/\u03c0). Let's compute that.\n\nCompute floor(10000/\u03c0) \u2248 floor(3183.09886184) = 3183.\n\nfloor(1000/\u03c0) \u2248 floor(318.309886184) = 318.\n\nSo, the number of zeros is 3183 - 318 = 2865.\n\nWait, that's different from the previous result. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, if \u03b8 goes from 1000 to 10000, the number of zeros is the number of times \u03b8 crosses n\u03c0 in that interval. So, the first \u03b8 where sin(\u03b8)=0 is at \u03b8= n\u03c0, where n is the smallest integer such that n\u03c0 \u2265 1000. Similarly, the last \u03b8 where sin(\u03b8)=0 is at \u03b8= m\u03c0, where m is the largest integer such that m\u03c0 \u2264 10000.\n\nSo, the number of zeros is m - n +1.\n\nWait, but in our case, \u03b8 starts at 1000 and ends at 10000. So, the first zero after \u03b8=1000 is at \u03b8=ceil(1000/\u03c0)*\u03c0. Similarly, the last zero before \u03b8=10000 is at \u03b8= floor(10000/\u03c0)*\u03c0.\n\nSo, the number of zeros is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0) +1.\n\nCompute ceil(1000/\u03c0) = 319, since 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so ceil is 319.\n\nfloor(10000/\u03c0) = 3183.\n\nSo, the number of zeros is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with the previous result where I thought n=3183 was excluded. So, which is correct?\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether the endpoints are included. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), x=0.0001 is excluded, so \u03b8=10000 is excluded. Similarly, x=0.001 is excluded, so \u03b8=1000 is excluded.\n\nWait, no, x=0.001 corresponds to \u03b8=1000, and x=0.0001 corresponds to \u03b8=10000. Since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), x is strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001, so \u03b8 is strictly between 1000 and 10000.\n\nSo, \u03b8 ranges from just above 1000 to just below 10000.\n\nSo, the zeros occur at \u03b8= n\u03c0, where n is an integer such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nSo, n must be integers from 319 to 3183, inclusive? Wait, but 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.00000000001, which is just over 10000, so n=3183 would give \u03b8=3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.00000000001, which is just over 10000, so it's excluded. Therefore, n can only go up to 3182, since 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9996.6144, which is less than 10000.\n\nWait, but then the number of zeros would be from n=319 to n=3182, which is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864.\n\nBut earlier, using the \u03b8 approach, I thought it was 2865. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let's think in terms of \u03b8. \u03b8 starts just above 1000 and ends just below 10000. So, the zeros are at \u03b8= n\u03c0 where n is integer, and 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nCompute 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so n must be greater than 318.309886184, so n starts at 319.\n\nSimilarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so n must be less than 3183.09886184, so n goes up to 3183.\n\nBut since \u03b8 must be less than 10000, n\u03c0 < 10000 \u21d2 n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so n can be up to 3183, but n=3183 would give \u03b8=3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.00000000001, which is just over 10000, so it's excluded. Therefore, n can only go up to 3182.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182, inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of zeros is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864.\n\nBut wait, earlier when I used the \u03b8 approach, I thought it was 2865. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the \u03b8 approach. Let me clarify.\n\nThe number of zeros between \u03b8=a and \u03b8=b is floor(b/\u03c0) - ceil(a/\u03c0) +1, but only if a and b are such that a < n\u03c0 < b for some n.\n\nWait, but in our case, a=1000, b=10000.\n\nSo, the number of zeros is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0) +1.\n\nCompute floor(10000/\u03c0) = 3183, ceil(1000/\u03c0)=319.\n\nSo, 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nBut wait, if \u03b8=3183\u03c0 is just over 10000, then it's excluded, so the number of zeros should be floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0).\n\nWhich would be 3183 - 319 = 2864.\n\nBut I'm getting conflicting results here. I think the confusion is whether to include the endpoint.\n\nWait, since \u03b8 must be less than 10000, and \u03b8=3183\u03c0 is just over 10000, it's excluded, so the number of zeros is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0) = 3183 - 319 = 2864.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought of the number of integers between a and b, it's floor(b) - ceil(a) +1.\n\nWait, let me test with a small example.\n\nSuppose a=2.3, b=5.7.\n\nThe integers between 2.3 and 5.7 are 3,4,5. So, 3 numbers.\n\nCompute floor(5.7)=5, ceil(2.3)=3.\n\nSo, 5 - 3 +1=3, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, if a=2.5, b=5.5.\n\nIntegers between 2.5 and 5.5 are 3,4,5. So, 3 numbers.\n\nfloor(5.5)=5, ceil(2.5)=3.\n\n5 -3 +1=3.\n\nSo, in general, the number of integers between a and b exclusive is floor(b) - ceil(a) +1.\n\nWait, but in our case, \u03b8 must be strictly between 1000 and 10000, so the zeros are at \u03b8= n\u03c0 where 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nSo, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, but n=3183 gives \u03b8=3183\u03c0\u224810000.00000000001, which is just over 10000, so it's excluded. Therefore, n goes up to 3182.\n\nSo, the number of n's is from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 +1=2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nBut wait, earlier when I used the formula floor(b/\u03c0) - ceil(a/\u03c0) +1, I got 2865. So, which is correct?\n\nI think the confusion is whether to include n=3183 or not. Since n=3183 gives \u03b8=3183\u03c0\u224810000.00000000001, which is just over 10000, so it's excluded. Therefore, n goes up to 3182, so the number of zeros is 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nTherefore, the correct number is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let's compute the number of zeros as the difference between \u03b8=10000 and \u03b8=1000 in terms of \u03c0.\n\nThe number of zeros is approximately (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 = 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.1978. Since we're dealing with discrete zeros, we take the integer part, which is 2866, but that's an approximation. But this is just an estimate, and the actual number is 2864, which is close.\n\nBut wait, 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.1978, which suggests that there are about 2866 zeros, but our exact calculation gave 2864. So, why the discrepancy?\n\nBecause when we go from \u03b8=1000 to \u03b8=10000, the number of zeros is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0) +1.\n\nWhich is 3183 - 319 +1=2865.\n\nBut since n=3183 gives \u03b8=3183\u03c0\u224810000.00000000001, which is just over 10000, so it's excluded, so the number of zeros is 3183 - 319=2864.\n\nTherefore, the correct number is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If \u03b8=1000 is excluded and \u03b8=10000 is excluded, then the number of zeros is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0).\n\nWhich is 3183 - 319=2864.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{2864}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we determine where \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\). This occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for integer \\( n \\), which implies \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n\n1. **Identify the range for \\( n \\):**\n   - The interval \\( 0.0001 < x < 0.001 \\) translates to \\( \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\) being within this range.\n   - Solving \\( 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\) gives:\n     - \\( n\\pi > 1000 \\) \u21d2 \\( n > \\frac{1000}{\\pi} \\approx 318.31 \\)\n     - \\( n\\pi < 10000 \\) \u21d2 \\( n < \\frac{10000}{\\pi} \\approx 3183.0989 \\)\n\n2. **Determine the integer bounds for \\( n \\):**\n   - The smallest integer \\( n \\) is 319.\n   - The largest integer \\( n \\) is 3183, but since \\( \\frac{1}{3183\\pi} \\) is just below 0.0001, it's excluded.

Similarly, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u21d2 1/(0.001) > n\u03c0 \u21d2 1000 > n\u03c0 \u21d2 n < 1000/\u03c0. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, actually, if 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, then 1/(0.001) > n\u03c0, so n\u03c0 < 1000, so n < 1000/\u03c0. Wait, but that's the same as the first inequality? That can't be. Wait, no, let's correct that. Let me think again. When I have 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0), that implies that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001 \u21d2 n\u03c0 < 10000 \u21d2 n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. Similarly, the other inequality is 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u21d2 n\u03c0 > 1/0.001 \u21d2 n\u03c0 > 1000 \u21d2 n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309 and less than approximately 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n ranges from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183, inclusive, we can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1. Wait, no: the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a = 319 and b = 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check that. Wait, 1000/\u03c0 is approximately 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 is approximately 3183.098, so the largest integer n is 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me calculate that: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that seems correct.

    "text": " Multiply both sides by n\u03c0 (since n is positive, the inequality sign doesn't change): 0.0001 * n\u03c0 < 1 Then, divide both sides by 0.0001\u03c0: n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) Let me compute 1/(0.0001\u03c0). 0.0001 is 10^{-4}, so 1/(10^{-4}\u03c0) = 10^4/\u03c0 \u2248 10000/3.1416 \u2248 3183.098. So, n < approximately 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n can be at most 3183. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Divide both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) 0.001 is 10^{-3}, so 1/(10^{-3}\u03c0) = 10^3/\u03c0 \u2248 1000/3.1416 \u2248 318.309. So, n > approximately 318.309. Since n must be an integer, n must be at least 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. To find the number of integers from a to b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, here, a = 319 and b = 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, 1/(0.0001\u03c0) is indeed 10^4/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. Then, 1/(0.001\u03c0) is 10^3/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. The number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. Yep, that seems correct. So, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, leading to x = 1/(n\u03c0).

    "text": " => 1/(0.0001) > n\u03c0 => 10000 > n\u03c0 => n < 10000/\u03c0. Similarly, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => 1/(0.001) > n\u03c0 => 1000 > n\u03c0 => n < 1000/\u03c0. Wait, but that seems contradictory. Let me check my steps again. So, starting with 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. If I take reciprocals, I have to reverse the inequalities because reciprocating reverses the order. So, 1/(0.001) < n\u03c0 < 1/(0.0001). Calculating those, 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Now, dividing all parts by \u03c0, we get 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values. Since \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. Now, since n has to be an integer, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. So, n can take integer values starting from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. Wait, let me confirm: the lower bound is 318.309886184, so the next integer is 319. The upper bound is 3183.09886184, so the largest integer n can be is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183. Now, to find how many integers are in this range, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the inequalities. Let me go through the steps once more to be sure.\n\nStarting again, the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0). The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Substituting x with 1/(n\u03c0), we get 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals and reversing inequalities, we have 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing by \u03c0, we get 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 318 = 2865. Wait, 3183 - 319 is 2864, then 2864 +1 = 2865. So, that seems correct. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in that interval.\n\nWait, but let me think about this again. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches zero. So, in the interval from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is quite close to zero, the function should have a lot of oscillations. Each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the sine function completes a half-period, so each x-intercept corresponds to an increase of \u03c0 in 1/x. So, the number of x-intercepts should indeed be proportional to the length of the interval in terms of 1/x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as the number of times 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0 as x moves from 0.0001 to 0.001. So, when x is 0.001, 1/x is 1000. When x is 0.0001, 1/x is 10000. So, as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001, 1/x increases from 1000 to 10000. So, the number of zeros of sin(1/x) in this interval would be the number of times 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. So, the smallest multiple of \u03c0 greater than 1000 is the next integer after 1000/\u03c0, which is 319\u03c0 \u2248 1002.368. Similarly, the largest multiple of \u03c0 less than 10000 is 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.695. So, the number of multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000 is 3183 - 318 = 2865. Wait, that's the same as before. So, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 319\u03c0 is approximately 1000.000... something, right? Because 318\u03c0 is 318*3.14159265 \u2248 1000. So, 318\u03c0 \u2248 1000, and 319\u03c0 \u2248 1000 + \u03c0 \u2248 1003.14159265. So, 319\u03c0 is the first multiple of \u03c0 greater than 1000. Similarly, 3183\u03c0 is the last multiple of \u03c0 less than 10000, which is 3183\u03c0 \u2248 3183*3.14159265 \u2248 9999.695. So, the number of multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000 is from n=319 to n=3183, which is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check if 3183\u03c0 is less than 10000. 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 Let me compute 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.14159265 \u2248 3183 * 0.14159265. Let me compute 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.04159265 \u2248 approx 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, and 3183 * 0.00159265 \u2248 approx 5.06. So, adding up, 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.06 \u2248 450.68. So total 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 9549 + 450.68 \u2248 9999.68, which is just under 10000, so yes, 3183\u03c0 is less than 10000. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because 2865 seems like a very large number. Let me think about the interval (0.0001, 0.001). The length of this interval is 0.001 - 0.0001 = 0.0009. But the function sin(1/x) has its period as 2\u03c0/(1/x) when x is changing, but actually, the function sin(1/x) has a variable period. As x approaches zero, the function oscillates more and more rapidly. So, in the interval from x = 0.0001 to x = 0.001, which is a small interval near zero, the function will have a very high frequency of oscillations, leading to many x-intercepts.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is to consider the change in 1/x over the interval. When x goes from 0.001 to 0.0001, 1/x goes from 1000 to 10000, so it increases by 9000. The zeros of sin(1/x) occur every \u03c0 units in 1/x. So, the number of zeros should be approximately (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 \u2248 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.197. Hmm, that's very close to the 2865 we calculated earlier. So, that seems consistent. The exact number would be the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which we found as 2865.\n\nWait, but 9000/\u03c0 is approximately 2866.197, which is very close to 2865, but not exactly the same. So, perhaps the exact count is 2865, which is the integer part.\n\nWait, let me think again: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so the next integer is 319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so the integer part is 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let's take a smaller example. Suppose I want to find the number of x-intercepts in (0.0002, 0.0003). Let's compute that. So, x is between 0.0002 and 0.0003, so 1/x is between approximately 3333.333 and 5000. So, 1/x goes from 3333.333 to 5000. The number of zeros would be the number of n where 3333.333 < n\u03c0 < 5000. So, n starts at ceil(3333.333/\u03c0) \u2248 ceil(1061.032) = 1062, and ends at floor(5000/\u03c0) \u2248 floor(1591.549) = 1591. So, the number of integers is 1591 - 1062 +1 = 530. Let me check that: 1591 - 1062 = 529, plus 1 is 530. Alternatively, using the formula, (5000 - 3333.333)/\u03c0 \u2248 1666.667/\u03c0 \u2248 530.54, which rounds down to 530. So, that seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in our original problem, the interval is from 1000 to 10000 in 1/x, so the number of n's is (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 \u2248 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.197, which would correspond to 2866 x-intercepts, but since we're starting from n=319, which is the next integer after 318.309, the exact count is 2865. Hmm, so why is there a discrepancy between the approximate 2866 and the exact 2865? Because when you take the integer parts, sometimes you lose a count. Let me check: 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. But 3183 - 318 = 2865, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 +1 = 2865. So, yes, that's correct. So, I think that's the right answer.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0), so for each integer n, we have a point in the graph. We need to count how many such points lie between x=0.0001 and x=0.001. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n, we get n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184 and n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in that range is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm once more. Let's take n=319, then x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.368) \u2248 0.0009976, which is greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. Similarly, n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(9999.695) \u2248 0.000100003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's within the interval. So, both endpoints are included, so n=319 gives x\u22480.0009976, which is less than 0.001, and n=3183 gives x\u22480.000100003, which is just above 0.0001. So, all these x's are within the interval. Therefore, the count is indeed 2865.\n\nI think I've gone through this thoroughly, checking each step and confirming with alternative methods. So, I'm confident that the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) has x-intercepts where \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\), which occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for integer \\( n \\).

Let me compute the numerical values of these bounds. First, \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184.

So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Yeah, that seems correct.

Therefore, combining both inequalities: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10,000. To find n, we can divide all parts by \u03c0. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10,000/\u03c0. Let me calculate these values numerically. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10,000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10,000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n must be greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184. Therefore, n can take integer values starting from 319 up to 3183. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, we subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, actually, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, so the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n that satisfy the condition. Each of these n corresponds to an x-intercept in the given interval. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. I started by setting sin(1/x) = 0, leading to 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). Then, substituting into the interval, I got 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which translates to n between 1000/\u03c0 and 10,000/\u03c0. Calculated those to be approximately 318.31 and 3183.09, so n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. So, I'm confident the answer is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001  \n\u21d2 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10,000  \n\u21d2 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10,000/\u03c0  \n\u2248 318.31 < n < 3183.09\n\nn ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

Dividing both sides by \u03c0, we get n < 10000/\u03c0. Similarly, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Taking reciprocals again, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Now, let's compute these values numerically. First, 10000 divided by \u03c0. Since \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. Similarly, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be an integer such that 318.30988618 < n < 3183.0988618.

Therefore, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. Because when x is 0.0001, 1/x is 10000, and when x is 0.001, 1/x is 1000. So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. So, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0. So, 1/x = n\u03c0, which means x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, n must satisfy 1000 \u2264 n\u03c0 \u2264 10000.

Wait, that can't be right because 3183 is much larger than 319, but let me think again. Wait, no, I think I messed up the inequalities. Let me start over.\n\nSo, we have x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), then 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me invert all parts, remembering that inverting reverses the inequalities because all terms are positive. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Then, dividing all parts by \u03c0, we get 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. So, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be an integer greater than 318.30988618 and less than 3183.0988618. Therefore, n can take integer values from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. Now, to find how many integers are in this range, we subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both ends are inclusive). Wait, no, let me think. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then +1 is 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n in that range, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. Let me check with specific values. Let's take n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.14) \u2248 0.00099687, which is approximately 0.00099687, which is greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. Similarly, n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, but since it's 1/(3183\u03c0), let me compute 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 10000.00000005, so x \u2248 1/10000.00000005 \u2248 0.0000999999995, which is just slightly less than 0.0001, so it's actually outside the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, so maybe n=3183 is not included because x would be less than 0.0001. Hmm, so perhaps the upper limit is n=3182, because 3182\u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 10000 - let's see, 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535.

So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.283 \u2248 0.000100037, which is just over 0.0001, so x is approximately 0.000100037, which is within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n=3182 gives x \u2248 0.000100037, which is inside the interval. Then, n=3183 gives x \u2248 0.0000999999995, which is just below 0.0001, so it's outside. Therefore, n can go up to 3182. So, the upper limit is n=3182. Therefore, the number of integers n is from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of terms is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 is 2864. So, there are 2864 x-intercepts. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, which is correct? Let me check again. When n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099687, which is within the interval. When n=3182, x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100037, which is within the interval. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3182. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. So, the answer should be 2864. But wait, earlier I thought it was 2865. Hmm, let me make sure. Let's take a smaller example to see if the formula works. Suppose I have integers from 5 to 8 inclusive. So, 5,6,7,8. The number of terms is 8 - 5 + 1 = 4, which is correct. So, applying that to 319 to 3182, it's 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. So, the correct number is 2864. Wait, but earlier when I thought n=3183 was included, I got 2865, but since n=3183 is excluded, it's 2864. So, the final answer is 2864 x-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). To find the number of such x in (0.0001, 0.001), we solve for n:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001  \nInverting gives: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000  \nDividing by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.10  \nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3182, inclusive. The number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}."

    "text": " This implies that 1/(0.0001) > n\u03c0, because if a < b, then 1/a > 1/b when a and b are positive. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. If I have 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0), then taking reciprocals on both sides (and remembering that flipping inequalities when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive) gives me 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. So, 10000 > n\u03c0, which means n < 10000/\u03c0. Similarly, the second inequality is 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which implies that n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, so n\u03c0 > 1000. Therefore, n > 1000/\u03c0. So, n must satisfy both n > 1000/\u03c0 and n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values numerically to get a better sense. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, n must be greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184. So, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are between 319 and 3183, inclusive. To find the number of integers from a to b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, substituting a = 319 and b = 3183, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, and then adding 1 gives 2865. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my arithmetic to be sure. 3183 minus 300 is 2883, and then minus 19 is 2864. Yep, so 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Each of these n corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me think again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the interval is from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is from 10^{-4} to 10^{-3}. The x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0), so I need to find all n such that 10^{-4} < 1/(n\u03c0) < 10^{-3}. Taking reciprocals, that's 10^{3} < n\u03c0 < 10^{4}, so n must be between 10^{3}/\u03c0 and 10^{4}/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.31 and 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more, which gives 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. Within the interval (0.0001, 0.001), we find the range of n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, leading to n between approximately 319 and 3183. The number of integers in this range is 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. So, starting with 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that taking reciprocals reverses the inequality, I get 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Since 0.0001 is 10^-4, so 1/0.0001 is 10^4, which is 10000. So, 10000 > n\u03c0, which implies n < 10000/\u03c0. Similarly, for the other inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals, 1/0.001 > n\u03c0, which is 1000 > n\u03c0, so n < 1000/\u03c0. Wait, but that can't be right because 1000/\u03c0 is about 318.31, and 10000/\u03c0 is about 3183.09. So, n has to be less than both 318.31 and 3183.09? That doesn't make sense because 318.31 is smaller than 3183.09. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inequalities. Let me think again. The interval for x is between 0.0001 and 0.001. Since x is positive, as x increases, 1/x decreases. So, when x is 0.0001, 1/x is 10000, and when x is 0.001, 1/x is 1000. So, the values of \u03b8 = 1/x range from 1000 to 10000 radians. So, \u03b8 \u2208 (1000, 10000). Now, sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 = n\u03c0, so n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing all parts by \u03c0, we get 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating these values: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be an integer greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319, and the largest possible n is 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, substituting, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Each of these n's corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial setup. The interval for x is (0.0001, 0.001), which translates to \u03b8 = 1/x being between 1000 and 10000. So, \u03b8 ranges from 1000 to 10000, and each time \u03b8 crosses a multiple of \u03c0, we get an x-intercept. So, the number of zeros is the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. So, the first multiple of \u03c0 greater than 1000 is n\u03c0 where n is the smallest integer greater than 1000/\u03c0, which is 319. The last multiple of \u03c0 less than 10000 is n\u03c0 where n is the largest integer less than 10000/\u03c0, which is 3183. So, the number of such n's is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of the number of zeros as the number of times the sine function completes a full cycle as \u03b8 increases from 1000 to 10000. Since the sine function has a period of 2\u03c0, the number of zeros in that interval would be approximately the total change in \u03b8 divided by \u03c0, since each zero occurs every \u03c0 radians. So, the total change in \u03b8 is 10000 - 1000 = 9000 radians. Dividing by \u03c0 gives 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.198. But since we're dealing with discrete zeros, we need to take the integer part, which would be 2866. But wait, that's different from the 2865 I got earlier. Hmm, maybe I need to check which approach is correct. Wait, perhaps the exact count is better. Let me try another approach. The number of zeros of sin(\u03b8) in the interval (a, b) is equal to the number of integers n such that a < n\u03c0 < b. So, the number of integers n satisfying a/\u03c0 < n < b/\u03c0. So, in this case, a = 1000, b = 10000. So, the number of integers n is floor(b/\u03c0) - ceil(a/\u03c0) + 1, if I'm not mistaken. Wait, actually, it's the number of integers between a/\u03c0 and b/\u03c0, not including the endpoints. So, the count is floor(b/\u03c0) - ceil(a/\u03c0) + 1. Let me compute that. So, a = 1000, a/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so ceil(a/\u03c0) is 319. b = 10000, b/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so floor(b/\u03c0) is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that's consistent with the earlier result. Therefore, the number of zeros is 2865. So, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). I think that's the correct answer. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. So, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so the next integer is 319. 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so the integer part is 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Solving for x gives x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 1/(n\u03c0) must be between 0.0001 and 0.001. This translates to n being between 319 and 3183. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

Again, taking reciprocals, n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Now, let me compute these values numerically. Let's calculate 10000/\u03c0 and 1000/\u03c0. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. Similarly, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, n can take integer values from the next integer after 318.309886184, which is 319, up to the integer less than 3183.09886184, which is 3183. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. Now, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then add 1 (since both endpoints are inclusive). Wait, actually, 319 is the starting point, so it's 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, that suggests there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when dealing with inequalities and reciprocals, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me verify the steps again. Starting with x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Then, since x = 1/(n\u03c0), substituting gives 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals, we have 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, dividing all parts by \u03c0, we get 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. As calculated earlier, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be an integer greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184. Therefore, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest is 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but just to be thorough, let me consider if n can take all integer values in that range without skipping any. Since n increases by 1 each time, and each n corresponds to a unique x in the interval, and each x is within (0.0001, 0.001), then yes, each n from 319 to 3183 will give a valid x-intercept.

Taking reciprocals on both sides (and remembering that this reverses the inequality since both sides are positive), we get n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating 1/0.0001, that's 10000. So, n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 3183.0988618. Since n must be an integer, n < 3183.0988618, so n can be at most 3183. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Similarly, taking reciprocals (again, flipping the inequality), we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001. 1/0.001 is 1000, so n\u03c0 > 1000. Therefore, n > 1000/\u03c0.

Wait, actually, let's think carefully. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, number of integers = 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Each of these n corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, first, the inequalities: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n: 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0). Which is 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. As I calculated, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3099, so n > 318.3099, so n starts at 319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988, so n < 3183.0988, so n ends at 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, yes, 2865 x-intercepts. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when dealing with inequalities, especially with reciprocals, I might have made a mistake in the direction of the inequalities. Let me confirm: Starting with 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0 (which is positive, so inequality stays the same): 0.0001 * n\u03c0 < 1. Then, dividing both sides by 0.0001: n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001 = 10000. So, n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988. Similarly, for the other inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0. Then, dividing both sides by 0.001: 1000 < n\u03c0. So, n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3099. So, yes, that's correct.

Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me check that again. Wait, no, actually, when I take reciprocals, I have to reverse the inequality signs because reciprocating reverses the order for positive numbers. So, for 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0), since 0.0001 is positive and less than 1/(n\u03c0), which is also positive, taking reciprocals would give 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0, which is 10000 > n\u03c0, so n < 10000/\u03c0. Similarly, for 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, taking reciprocals gives n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000, so n > 1000/\u03c0. So, putting it together, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Now, let's compute 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0 to find the range of n. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, n can take integer values starting from the next integer greater than 318.309886184, which is 319, up to the integer less than 3183.09886184, which is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Now, to find how many integers are in this range, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then adjust if necessary. Wait, actually, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a = 319 and b = 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then +1 is 2865. So, there are 2865 integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. Let me double-check. When I have 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0), taking reciprocals gives 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0, which is correct, and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 gives n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000, so n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184. So, n starts at 319. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 gives n > 1000/\u03c0, so n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184, so the smallest integer n is 319. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 gives n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so the largest integer n is 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, yes, 2865 x-intercepts.

So, n\u03c0 < 10000, which means n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n has to be an integer, the maximum integer n can be is 3183. Now, let's look at the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Similarly, taking reciprocals, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n\u03c0 > 1000, which means n > 1000/\u03c0.

So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. Now, to find how many integers are in this range, we can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add one (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of terms in this sequence is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more, which is 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct. So, I think 2865 is the right answer. \n\nWait a second, but I should also check if n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0) which is just above 0.001, and n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) which is just below 0.0001. Let me verify that. For n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0). Let's compute 319*\u03c0: 319*3.1415926535 \u2248 319*3.1415926535 \u2248 let's see, 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477, 19\u03c0 \u2248 59.690, so total is approximately 942.477 + 59.690 \u2248 1002.167. So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.167 \u2248 0.0009978, which is approximately 0.0009978, which is just below 0.001, so it's within the interval. Similarly, for n=3183: 3183\u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let's approximate: 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.777, 183\u03c0 \u2248 575.006. So, total is approximately 9424.777 + 575.006 \u2248 9999.783.

Therefore, both n=319 and n=3183 are included, so the count from 319 to 3183 inclusive is correct. Thus, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where the function crosses the x-axis, i.e., where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. So, the number of n's is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that seems correct. But wait, let me check with specific numbers. For example, when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.5) \u2248 0.000996, which is less than 0.001 and greater than 0.0001. Similarly, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, does n=3183 give x=0.0001 exactly? Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0). 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.0001, does that mean x=0.0001 is excluded? So, n=3183 would give x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but since it's open, x=0.0001 is not included. So, does that mean n can only go up to 3182? Wait, let me check: 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. So, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, but the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which doesn't include 0.0001. Therefore, n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. So, the maximum n is 3182. Let me check that: n=3182, x=1/(3182\u03c0). Let's compute 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000 - 3.1416 \u2248 9996.8584. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.8584 \u2248 0.00010003, which is slightly above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. Wait, but 0.00010003 is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. So, n=3182 gives x\u22480.00010003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. But n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001, which is excluded. So, n goes from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but now I'm getting 2864. So, which one is correct? Let me think again. The inequality is 0.0001 < x < 0.001. So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, for x=1/(n\u03c0), we have 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let's solve for n:\n\nFrom 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0), we get n < 1/(0.0001 * \u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n must be less than that, so n \u2264 3183. But since x must be greater than 0.0001, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, so n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is not included in the interval. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but since x=1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded, n must be up to 3182. Similarly, from the lower end: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, so n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n starts at 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. So, the correct number is 2864. Therefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2864 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nSolving for n:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000  \n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0  \n\u2248318.31 < n < \u22483183.098\n\nn ranges from 319 to 3182, inclusive. The number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\n$\\boxed{2864}$"

Let's compute 1/0.0001. Well, 0.0001 is 10^-4, so 1/10^-4 is 10^4, which is 10000. So, n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n is an integer, the maximum possible n is 3183. Now, let's take the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001. 1/0.001 is 1000, so n\u03c0 > 1000. Therefore, n > 1000/\u03c0. Let's compute that: 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618. Since n is an integer, the smallest possible n is 319. Now, so n ranges from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. To find the number of integers in this range, we can compute 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me calculate that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n in this range, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0), and we're looking for x between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, substituting x = 1/(n\u03c0), we have 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing by \u03c0, we get 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.31 < n < 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. If 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0), then taking reciprocals on both sides (and remembering to flip the inequality because reciprocals reverse the order for positive numbers), we get 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0, which is 10000 > n\u03c0, so n < 10000/\u03c0.

Wait, but that can't be right because 10000 is greater than 1000, so n must satisfy both inequalities, meaning n < 1000/\u03c0? That doesn't make sense because 1000/\u03c0 is about 318.31, and 10000/\u03c0 is about 3183.09. So, if I take the more restrictive condition, n must be less than 318.31. But that would mean n can go up to 318, but wait, let me check the substitution again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let's go step by step. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001). So, x is greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), then 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let's solve for n in each inequality.\n\nFirst inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0)\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0 (since n and \u03c0 are positive, the inequality sign doesn't change):\n0.0001 * n\u03c0 < 1\nThen, divide both sides by 0.0001:\nn\u03c0 < 1 / 0.0001\nn\u03c0 < 10000\nSo, n < 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1416 \u2248 3183.098\n\nSecond inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0:\n1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0\nThen, divide both sides by 0.001:\n1000 < n\u03c0\nSo, n > 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.309\n\nSo, combining both inequalities, n must satisfy:\n318.309 < n < 3183.098\n\nSince n must be an integer, n can take integer values from 319 up to 3183. Now, to find how many integers are in this range, we can compute 3183 - 319 + 1. Wait, why +1? Because when counting inclusive integers from a to b, the count is b - a + 1. So, let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n that satisfy the inequality. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the substitution. So, x must be between 0.0001 and 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), as n increases, x decreases. So, when n is 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.18) \u2248 0.0009978, which is just below 0.001, so it's within the interval. Similarly, when n is 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.05) \u2248 0.00009999, which is just above 0.0001, so it's within the interval. Therefore, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive will give x within (0.0001, 0.001). So, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check the exact values. Let's compute 1000/\u03c0 more accurately. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098861. So, the smallest integer n is 319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098861. So, the largest integer n is 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when n increases, x decreases. So, as n goes from 319 to 3183, x goes from just below 0.001 down to just above 0.0001. So, each integer n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept in the interval. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but I want to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let me verify the range of n again.\n\nGiven that x must be between 0.0001 and 0.001, so:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nTaking reciprocals (and flipping inequalities because reciprocals reverse the order for positive numbers):\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing all parts by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nAs before, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3099 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0989. So, n must be greater than 318.3099 and less than 3183.0989. Since n is an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\n2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nYes, that's correct. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check with specific examples. Let's take n = 319:\n\nx = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.18) \u2248 0.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so it's in the interval.\n\nn = 3183:\n\nx = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.05) \u2248 0.00009999, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's in the interval.\n\nWhat about n = 318:\n\nx = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.53) \u2248 0.0009995, which is still less than 0.001, but n = 318 is less than 318.3099, so it's not included. Therefore, n starts at 319.\n\nSimilarly, n = 3184:\n\nx = 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10003.2) \u2248 0.000099968, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, n ends at 3183.\n\nSo, the count is indeed from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 2865 x-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We seek x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n gives 318.31 < n < 3183.09. The integers n range from 319 to 3183, inclusive.

Now, let me compute these values numerically. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. Since n must be an integer, n ranges from the smallest integer greater than 318.30988618 to the largest integer less than 3183.0988618. The smallest integer greater than 318.30988618 is 319, and the largest integer less than 3183.0988618 is 3183. Now, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Each of these n corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, let me double-check my calculations. So, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, so n must be greater than this, so starting at n=319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618, so n must be less than this, so the largest integer n is 3183. The count from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2864 + 1 = 2865.

Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me check my steps again. If I have 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0), then taking reciprocals on both sides (remembering that flipping inequalities when multiplying/dividing by negative numbers, but since all terms are positive here, the direction remains the same when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive).

But since we're dealing with x between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is from 10^{-4} to 10^{-3}, and 1/x would range from 10^4 to 10^3, so 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, 1/x = n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000. Therefore, n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000, so n must be between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute those values. 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.3098861. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 3183.098861. So, n must be an integer such that 318.3098861 < n < 3183.098861. Since n must be an integer, n starts from 319 and goes up to 3183. Now, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1. Wait, no, because 318 is less than 318.3098861, so the first integer n is 319, and the last is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check that. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here a = 319, b = 3183. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Solving for x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) gives x = 1/(n\u03c0) with n between 319 and 3183. The number of integers in this range is 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

So, putting both together: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. To find n, I can divide each part by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me calculate the numerical values. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n must be greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184. So, n can take integer values starting from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. But here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers in this range.

Similarly, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u21d2 1/(0.001) > n\u03c0 \u21d2 1000 > n\u03c0 \u21d2 n < 1000/\u03c0. Wait, but I think I might have messed up the direction of the inequality when taking reciprocals. Let me double-check. If I have 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0), then taking reciprocals on both sides (since both sides are positive) would reverse the inequality: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0 \u21d2 10000 > n\u03c0. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u21d2 n\u03c0 > 1/0.001 \u21d2 n\u03c0 > 1000 \u21d2 n > 1000/\u03c0. So, combining both inequalities, I get: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Now, since n must be an integer, I need to find how many integers lie strictly between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values numerically. First, \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. Now, since n must be an integer, the smallest integer greater than 318.309886184 is 319, and the largest integer less than 3183.09886184 is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers in this range, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, no, actually, since the lower bound is 319, which is 318 + 1, and the upper bound is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me calculate that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. Let me check with n=319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.0) \u2248 0.000998, which is just above 0.0001, so it's within the interval. Similarly, n=3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, but wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 1/(10000) because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000, so x \u2248 0.0001. But our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, does n=3183 give x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is exactly the lower bound. But since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so x=0.0001 is not included. Therefore, n=3183 would give x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is not included in the interval. So, actually, n must be less than 3183.09886184, but since n is an integer, the maximum n is 3183, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) is equal to 0.0001 approximately, which is not included. So, perhaps n should be up to 3182? Wait, let me check that. Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0): 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.14159265 \u2248 3183 * 0.14 \u2248 445.62, so total \u2248 9549 + 445.62 \u2248 9994.62. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9994.62 \u2248 0.00010005, which is just slightly above 0.0001. So, x=0.00010005 is greater than 0.0001, so it is included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 is acceptable because x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010005 is within the interval. Similarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.000998, which is less than 0.001, so it's also within the interval. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, the total number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me make sure that when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) is indeed greater than 0.0001. Let me compute 319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 1002.0, so 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000998, which is 0.000998, which is 0.000998, which is greater than 0.0001. Similarly, for n=3183, x\u22480.00010005, which is just above 0.0001. So, both endpoints are included in the interval. Therefore, the count is from n=319 to n=3183, inclusive, which gives 2865 x-intercepts. Wait, but let me check if 3183\u03c0 is exactly 10000. Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0: 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.0415926535 \u2248 let's compute 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, 3183 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 approximately 5.06, so total \u2248 318.3 + 127.32 + 5.06 \u2248 450.68. So, total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9549 + 450.68 \u2248 9999.68, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.68 \u2248 0.000100003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, n=3183 is acceptable. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.

Let me double-check. If 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, then n > 1000/\u03c0, right? Because if I take reciprocals on both sides, the inequality flips. So, n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098861.

Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me think again. If I have 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0), then taking reciprocals (and remembering to flip the inequality because both sides are positive) gives 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0, which is 10000 > n\u03c0, so n < 10000/\u03c0.

That can't be right because the first inequality is stricter. So, perhaps I made a mistake in handling the inequalities. Let me try again. Starting with 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let's solve for n in each part. First, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Multiply both sides by n\u03c0 (since n and \u03c0 are positive, the inequality direction remains the same): 0.0001 * n\u03c0 < 1. Then, divide both sides by 0.0001: n\u03c0 < 1 / 0.0001 => n\u03c0 < 10000 => n < 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. Next, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Multiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0. Then, divide both sides by 0.001: n\u03c0 > 1000 => n > 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.3098862. So, combining both inequalities, n must satisfy 318.3098862 < n < 3183.0988618. Since n must be an integer, n can take integer values from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to count how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, substituting a = 319 and b = 3183, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.

So, plugging in the values: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that. 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's verify the inequalities again. We had 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, taking reciprocals, we get 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Then, dividing by \u03c0, we get 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.30988618 < n < 3183.0988618. So, n must be integers starting from 319 up to 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0. This occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. To find the number of such x in (0.0001, 0.001), we solve 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, leading to n ranging from 319 to 3183. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

Wait, but that seems conflicting. Let me think again. When I have 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0), I can invert both sides, remembering that inverting reverses the inequality. So, 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0, which is 10000 > n\u03c0. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies that 1/0.001 > n\u03c0, which is 1000 > n\u03c0. So, combining both, n\u03c0 must be greater than 1000 and less than 10000? Wait, no. Let me re-examine. The first inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) implies that 1/(0.0001) > n\u03c0, which is 10000 > n\u03c0. The second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies that 1/0.001 > n\u03c0, which is 1000 > n\u03c0. Wait, that can't be right because 10000 > n\u03c0 and 1000 > n\u03c0 would both require n\u03c0 to be less than 1000 and 10000, but that doesn't make sense. I think I made a mistake in the direction of the inequalities when inverting. Let me clarify: If I have a < b, then 1/a > 1/b when a and b are positive. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) implies that 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0, which is 10000 > n\u03c0. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies that 1/0.001 > n\u03c0, which is 1000 > n\u03c0. Wait, but that would mean n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000? No, that's not correct because if 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0), then 1/(n\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001, which implies that n\u03c0 is less than 1/0.0001, which is 10000. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies that n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, combining both, we have 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0. Since \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319 and the largest possible n is 3183. Now, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, we can compute 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me calculate that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, starting from 0.0001 < x < 0.001, and x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Inverting all parts, remembering that inverting reverses inequalities when dealing with positive numbers, we get 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Then, dividing each part by \u03c0, we get 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which as I calculated before is approximately 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1, so 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct. So, I think the answer is 2865 x-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer values of n. To find the number of such x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), we determine the range of n:\n\n1. 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n2. Inverting the inequalities (since all terms are positive), we get 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n3. Dividing by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.\n4. Calculating the bounds: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098.\n5. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n6. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

Calculating that, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000/3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n is an integer, n \u2264 3183. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which implies that 1/(0.001) > n\u03c0. 1/0.001 is 1000, so 1000 > n\u03c0, meaning n < 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000/3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be less than approximately 318.30988618. Therefore, n \u2264 318. Wait, but hold on. I think I made a mistake here. Let me double-check. When I have 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, taking reciprocals (and remembering to flip the inequality) gives n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618. Since n is an integer, n \u2265 319. Wait, that's conflicting with the first inequality. Let me clarify. Let's take the inequalities again:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nThis can be split into two inequalities:\n\n1. 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0)\n2. 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nStarting with the first inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0)\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0 (which is positive, so inequality remains the same):\n\n0.0001 * n\u03c0 < 1\n\nDivide both sides by 0.0001:\n\nn\u03c0 < 1 / 0.0001\n\nn\u03c0 < 10000\n\nSo, n < 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618\n\nThus, n \u2264 3183.\n\nSecond inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0:\n\n1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by 0.001:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0\n\nSo, n > 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618\n\nThus, n \u2265 319 (since n must be an integer).\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, to find the number of integers n in this range, we can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add one (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183, inclusive, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 -19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2865.\n\nSo, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. When I have x between 0.0001 and 0.001, that's the same as 1/x between 1000 and 10000. So, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0, which is when 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, x must be between 0.0001 and 0.001, so 1/(n\u03c0) must be between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and flipping inequalities):\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing all parts by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nWhich is approximately 318.30988618 < n < 3183.0988618\n\nSince n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me think about whether 1/(n\u03c0) is strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. So, x must be in (0.0001, 0.001), which means 1/x is in (1000, 10000). So, 1/x must be greater than 1000 and less than 10000. So, 1/x = n\u03c0, so n\u03c0 must be greater than 1000 and less than 10000. So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618.\n\nThus, n can be 319, 320, ..., up to 3183. So, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that n=3183 is included. 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000) \u2248 0.0001. But since x must be greater than 0.0001, does 1/(3183\u03c0) equal exactly 0.0001? Let's check:\n\nIf 1/(n\u03c0) = 0.0001, then n = 1/(0.0001 * \u03c0) \u2248 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n is approximately 3183.0988618, but since n must be an integer, n=3183 would give x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010000 something, which is just over 0.0001. Similarly, n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.06) \u2248 0.00099698, which is just under 0.001. So, both endpoints are included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me check if 1/(3183\u03c0) is indeed greater than 0.0001. Let's compute 1/(3183 * \u03c0). Let's compute 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, and 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 574.59864. So, total is approximately 9424.77796 + 574.59864 \u2248 10,000. So, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since 3183 * \u03c0 is slightly less than 10,000 (because 3183.0988618 * \u03c0 \u2248 10,000), so 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 10,000 - (0.0988618 * \u03c0) \u2248 10,000 - 0.309886 \u2248 9999.690114. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.690114 \u2248 0.000100003. So, that's just over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=319: 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 1003.06, so 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099698, which is just under 0.001, so included as well.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of terms. So, from n=319 to n=3183 inclusive, how many terms? The formula is (last - first) + 1. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the number of integers between a and b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nSo, the answer should be 2865 x-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integers n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 1/(n\u03c0) must be between 0.0001 and 0.001. Solving for n gives n between approximately 319 and 3183. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

Since \u03c0 is approximately 3.1416, 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.098862. So, n < approximately 3183.098862.

Now, since n has to be an integer, the smallest integer greater than 318.3098862 is 319, and the largest integer less than 3183.098862 is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183. To find the number of integers between two numbers inclusive, I can subtract the smaller number from the larger one and add 1. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, and then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Each of these n corresponds to an x-intercept of the function y = sin(1/x) in that interval. Wait, but let me double-check if I did the calculations correctly. Let me recalculate the bounds for n. Starting with the lower bound: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u21d2 1/(0.0001) is 10000, so 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098862. So, n must be less than that, so the maximum integer n is 3183. For the upper bound: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u21d2 n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u21d2 1/0.001 is 1000, so 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098862. So, n must be greater than that, so the minimum integer n is 319. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. Now, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's it. So, the function y = sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly as x approaches 0, and in the interval from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is very close to zero, the function oscillates a huge number of times, leading to a large number of x-intercepts.

So, n < 10000/\u03c0. Similarly, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n\u03c0 > 1/0.001 => n\u03c0 > 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Now, let me compute these values. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. Similarly, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618 and less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n has to be an integer, n can take integer values from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is given by b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, and then adding 1 gives 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in that interval. Wait, let me double-check my calculations. 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618, so n must be less than that, so the maximum integer n is 3183. Similarly, 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, so the smallest integer n is 319. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2865. That seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, leading to x = 1/(n\u03c0). In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), n ranges from 319 to 3183, resulting in 2865 intercepts.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

Similarly, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies that 1/(0.001) > n\u03c0. 1/0.001 is 1,000, so 1,000 > n\u03c0, which means n < 1,000/\u03c0. Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me double-check. If 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, then n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001 = 10,000, so n < 10,000/\u03c0. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies that n\u03c0 > 1/0.001 = 1,000, so n > 1,000/\u03c0. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. If I have 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, then taking reciprocals (and remembering to flip the inequality because reciprocals reverse the inequality for positive numbers), I get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1,000. So, n > 1,000/\u03c0. Similarly, from 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, we have n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001 = 10,000, so n < 10,000/\u03c0. So, n must satisfy 1,000/\u03c0 < n < 10,000/\u03c0. Now, let me compute these values numerically. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926536. So, 1,000/\u03c0 \u2248 1,000 / 3.1415926536 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10,000/\u03c0 \u2248 10,000 / 3.1415926536 \u2248 3,183.09886184. So, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3,183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319, and the largest possible n is 3,183. Now, to find how many integers are between 319 and 3,183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3,183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, no. Wait, 3,183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3,183 - 319 = 2,864. Then, 2,864 + 1 = 2,865. So, there are 2,865 integer values of n between 319 and 3,183 inclusive. Each of these n values corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2,865. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3,183. The number of terms in this sequence is 3,183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3,183 - 319 = 2,864. Adding 1 gives 2,865. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of it as the number of integers from 1 to 3,183 minus the number of integers from 1 to 318. So, 3,183 - 318 = 2,865. Either way, I get 2,865.

    "text": " This implies that 1/(0.0001) > n\u03c0, because when you take reciprocals in inequalities, the direction flips. Calculating 1/0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, we get n < 10000/\u03c0. Similarly, for the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Taking reciprocals again, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Now, let's compute these numerical values. First, 10000 divided by \u03c0. Since \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, 10000/\u03c0 is roughly 10000/3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. Similarly, 1000/\u03c0 is about 1000/3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618 and less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n has to be an integer, the smallest integer greater than 318.30988618 is 319, and the largest integer less than 3183.0988618 is 3183. Now, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n that satisfy the condition. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Sometimes when dealing with inequalities, it's easy to make a mistake with the direction of the inequality or the endpoints. Let me verify the steps again. Starting with 0.0001 < x < 0.001 and x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals, since all terms are positive, the inequalities reverse: 1/0.001 > n\u03c0 > 1/0.0001. Which is 1000 > n\u03c0 > 10000. Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, 0.0001 is 1e-4, and 0.001 is 1e-3. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals, we get 1/(0.001) < n\u03c0 < 1/(0.0001), which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. As I calculated before, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618 and less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n is an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but I should check if n=319 gives x within the interval. Let's compute x for n=319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.0) \u2248 0.000997, which is approximately 0.001, but wait, 0.000997 is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Similarly, for n=3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, but since 3183 is less than 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 3183.09886, so 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since 3183 is less than 10000/\u03c0, x will be slightly greater than 0.0001. Wait, no, 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10000, so x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since 3183 is less than 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 3183.09886, so 3183\u03c0 is slightly less than 10000, so x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly greater than 0.0001. So, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is just above 0.0001, which is within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 2865 x-intercepts. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of integers. Sometimes when counting inclusive integers, it's easy to miscount. Let's take a smaller example to verify. Suppose I have n from 3 to 5 inclusive. That's 3,4,5: 3 numbers. So, 5 - 3 + 1 = 3. Correct. Similarly, from 1 to 1: 1 number. 1 -1 +1 =1. Correct. So, applying that here, 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Thus, n ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 intercepts.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so let's calculate: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. But n has to be an integer because x-intercepts occur at integer multiples of \u03c0 in the argument of the sine function. So, n must be an integer between 319 and 3183, inclusive. Wait, let me check that. Since n > 318.309886184, the smallest integer n can be is 319. Similarly, n < 3183.09886184, so the largest integer n can be is 3183. Now, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of integers is 3183 - 318 = 2865, and then add 1 gives 2866. Wait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. If I have integers from a to b inclusive, the count is b - a + 1. So here, a = 319, b = 3183. So, the count is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 gives 2865. Hmm, so that would mean there are 2865 integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive. But let me verify that again. Alternatively, I can think of it as the number of integers less than or equal to 3183 minus the number of integers less than 319. The number of integers less than or equal to 3183 is 3183, and the number of integers less than 319 is 318. So, 3183 - 318 = 2865. Yep, that's correct. So, there are 2865 integer values of n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial setup. So, when I set up the inequalities, I had 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which led me to n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 and n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183. So, the count is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That seems right. Alternatively, I can think of it as the number of integers between 318.309886184 and 3183.09886184, which is the same as from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which gives 2865.
