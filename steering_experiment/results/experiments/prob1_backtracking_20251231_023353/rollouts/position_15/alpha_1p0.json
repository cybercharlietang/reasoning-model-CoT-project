    "text": " Let's solve for n. Multiply both sides by n\u03c0: 0.0001 * n\u03c0 < 1 Then, divide both sides by 0.0001\u03c0: n < 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) Let me compute that. 1 / 0.0001 is 10,000, so 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) is 10,000/\u03c0. Let me calculate that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.14159265, so 10,000 / 3.14159265 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n < approximately 3183.0988618. Since n has to be an integer, n can be up to 3183. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Let's solve for n. Multiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, divide both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) Compute that: 1 / 0.001 is 1000, so 1 / (0.001\u03c0) is 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618. Since n is an integer, the smallest n can be is 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, let me just double-check my steps. I found that x = 1/(n\u03c0) must lie between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, I correctly transformed the inequalities to find n. I solved for n and found that n must be between approximately 318.31 and 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The count is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. That seems correct. Hmm, but just to make sure, maybe I should check with specific values. Let me take n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.29) \u2248 0.0009967, which is approximately 0.001, but since 0.0009967 is less than 0.001, it's within the interval. Now, n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0005) \u2248 0.000099999, which is just above 0.0001, so it's also within the interval. So, both endpoints are included. Therefore, the count is indeed 2865. I think that's correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's see: 3183 minus 319. Let's compute 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes when counting inclusive ranges, it's easy to make a mistake, so maybe I can think of a smaller example. Suppose I have numbers from 3 to 5 inclusive. That's 3,4,5: 3 numbers. So, 5 - 3 + 1 = 3. So, that works. Similarly, from 10 to 12: 10,11,12: 3 numbers, 12 -10 +1=3. So, yes, the formula works. So, in this case, 3183 - 319 +1=2865. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me also think about whether all these x values lie strictly within (0.0001, 0.001). So, for n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009967, which is less than 0.001, so it's inside. For n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000099999, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's inside. So, all the x's from n=319 to n=3183 are within (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the count is correct.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

Taking reciprocals on both sides (and remembering that flipping the inequality because both sides are positive), we get: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0 Which is 10000 > n\u03c0, so n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n < approximately 3183.0988618. Since n must be an integer, n can be at most 3183. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, take reciprocals and flip the inequality: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001 = 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618. Since n is an integer, n must be at least 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Wait, is that right? Wait, 3183 - 319 is actually 2864, yes, because 319 + 2864 = 3183. So, 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when dealing with inequalities, especially with reciprocals, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me verify the lower bound first. The lower bound is x > 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which implies n\u03c0 < 10000, so n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618, so n can be up to 3183. Correct. The upper bound is x < 0.001, so 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which implies n\u03c0 > 1000, so n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, so n starts at 319. So, n runs from 319 to 3183. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, and 2864 + 1 = 2865. Yes, that seems correct.

Similarly, for the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Taking reciprocals again: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001 => n\u03c0 > 1000 => n > 1000/\u03c0. So, combining both inequalities, n must satisfy: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Now, let me compute these values numerically. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.3098861. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.098861. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.3098861 and less than approximately 3183.098861. Since n must be an integer, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183, inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1. Wait, let me think about that again. If I have integers from a to b inclusive, the count is b - a + 1. So here, a = 319 and b = 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, checking the inequalities: x = 1/(n\u03c0), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals, as I did, gives 10000 > n\u03c0 > 1000. So, n must be between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which is correct. Calculating 1000/\u03c0: 1000 \u00f7 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.3098861, which rounds up to 319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098861, which rounds down to 3183 since n must be less than that. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We seek x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating these bounds gives n from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, no, actually, since n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, the number of integers is 3183 - 318 = 2865, but wait, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Each of these n corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 1000/\u03c0 is approximately 318.309886184, so the next integer is 319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 is approximately 3183.09886184, so the largest integer less than that is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, yes, 2865 x-intercepts. But wait, another way to think about it is that the number of zeros of sin(1/x) in (a, b) is approximately the number of times 1/x crosses multiples of \u03c0 as x decreases from b to a. So, the number of zeros is roughly (1/a - 1/b)/\u03c0. Let me check that. Here, a = 0.0001 and b = 0.001. So, 1/a = 10000, 1/b = 1000. So, (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 = 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.197. Hmm, that's close to 2865. The difference is because when I took the floor and ceiling, I might have included or excluded one. Let me see: 9000/\u03c0 is approximately 2866.197, so the number of zeros should be the integer part, which is 2866. Wait, but earlier I got 2865. There's a discrepancy here. Let me check my earlier calculation again. So, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so n must be greater than that, so n starts at 319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so n must be less than that, so n ends at 3183. So, the number of n's is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. But the other approach gives me approximately 2866.197, which suggests 2866. So, which one is correct? Let me see. The exact number should be the floor of 10000/\u03c0 minus the ceiling of 1000/\u03c0 plus 1. So, floor(10000/\u03c0) = 3183, ceiling(1000/\u03c0) = 319. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Alternatively, the number of zeros is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - floor(1/(b\u03c0)) where a = 0.0001 and b = 0.001. Wait, let me check that formula. The number of zeros of sin(1/x) in (a, b) is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - floor(1/(b\u03c0)). So, 1/(a\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so floor is 3183. 1/(b\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so floor is 318. So, the number of zeros is 3183 - 318 = 2865. But wait, that's the same as before. So, that suggests 2865 is correct. But in the other approach, I thought of (1/a - 1/b)/\u03c0 = 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.197, which is about 2866. So, why the discrepancy? Because when I take (1/a - 1/b)/\u03c0, I'm approximating the number of oscillations, but in reality, the exact count is given by the floor function approach. So, in this case, the exact number is 2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need to find the integers n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n gives 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183, resulting in 2865 x-intercepts.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

    "text": " Let's solve for n. Taking reciprocals on both sides (and remembering that reversing inequalities when taking reciprocals since both sides are positive), we get: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0 => 10000 > n\u03c0 => n < 10000/\u03c0. Similarly, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Taking reciprocals again: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001 => n\u03c0 > 1000 => n > 1000/\u03c0. So, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Now, let's compute these values numerically. First, 1000 divided by \u03c0. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, n must be greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184. So, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183. Now, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. But here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait a minute, let me double-check that calculation to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, right? Because 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more to get 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of it as n starting at 319 and going up to 3183. The count is 3183 - 318 = 2865, since from 1 to 3183 is 3183 numbers, and from 1 to 318 is 318 numbers, so subtracting gives 3183 - 318 = 2865. Yeah, that checks out. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial step. When I set sin(1/x) = 0, I got 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). Then, substituting into the interval, I got 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which led to 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so n is between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0. Calculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so n must be greater than that, so the smallest integer n is 319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so the largest integer n is 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me make sure about the direction of the inequalities. When I took reciprocals, I correctly reversed the inequalities because I was dealing with positive numbers. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) implies that n\u03c0 < 10000, which is correct, and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies that n\u03c0 > 1000, which is also correct. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which gives the bounds on n as I calculated. So, I think my reasoning is correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Solving for x gives x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Thus, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

    "text": " Let's solve for n. Multiply both sides by n\u03c0: 0.0001 * n\u03c0 < 1 Then, divide both sides by 0.0001\u03c0: n < 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) Let me compute 1 / (0.0001\u03c0). 0.0001 is 1e-4, so 1 / (1e-4 * \u03c0) = 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1416 \u2248 3183.098. So, n < approximately 3183.098. Since n is a positive integer, n can be up to 3183.\n\nNow, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Let's solve for n. Multiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, divide both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) Let's compute 1 / (0.001\u03c0). 0.001 is 1e-3, so 1 / (1e-3 * \u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.309. So, n > approximately 318.309. Since n is an integer, n must be at least 319.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, we can compute 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me calculate that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers in that range. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with the inequalities:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nFirst, solving for n when 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001:\n\nn < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n = 1 to 3183.\n\nBut wait, no, that's not right because 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0). But when considering the interval (0.0001, 0.001), we need x > 0.0001 and x < 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. Therefore, n must be integers greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098, so n starts at 319 and ends at 3183.\n\nThus, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 -19=2864. Then add 1: 2865. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0) which is approximately 1/(1002.3) \u2248 0.0009977, which is less than 0.001, so that's within the interval. Similarly, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u22481/(10000.000...) which is 0.0001, but since the interval is open at 0.0001, we need to make sure that x=1/(n\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 10000/\u03c0 \u22483183.098, so n can be up to 3183, since 3183\u03c0 \u224810000.000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u22480.0001. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), we need x > 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which is n < 10000/\u03c0 \u22483183.098, so n can be up to 3183 because 3183 is less than 3183.098. Similarly, n must be greater than 318.309, so starting at 319.\n\nThus, the number of x-intercepts is indeed 3183 - 319 +1=2865.\n\nWait, but let me check with specific numbers. Let me compute 1/(319\u03c0) and 1/(3183\u03c0) to see where they fall.\n\nCompute 1/(319\u03c0): 319 * \u03c0 \u2248319 *3.1416\u22481002.3, so 1/1002.3\u22480.0009977, which is less than 0.001, so that's within the interval.\n\n1/(3183\u03c0): 3183 * \u03c0 \u22483183 *3.1416\u224810000.000, so 1/10000\u22480.0001, but since the interval is open at 0.0001, x must be greater than 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001, which is n < 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.098, so n=3183 is allowed because 3183 <3183.098. So, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, but since it's greater than 0.0001, it's included. Wait, but 1/(3183\u03c0)=1/(3183*3.1415926535)\u22481/(10000.000)\u22480.0001, but actually, 3183*\u03c0 is approximately 10000.000, so 1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.0001, does x=0.0001 count? No, because it's excluded. So, x must be greater than 0.0001, so n must satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) >0.0001, which is n <10000/\u03c0\u22483183.098. So, n can be up to 3183, because 3183 <3183.098. But wait, 1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001 exactly? Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0 more accurately.\n\n\u03c0\u22483.1415926535\n\n3183 * \u03c0 \u22483183 *3.1415926535\n\nLet me compute 3000*\u03c0\u22489424.77796\n\n183*\u03c0\u2248574.79353\n\nAdding together: 9424.77796 +574.79353\u224810,000. So, 3183*\u03c0\u224810,000 exactly. So, 1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001 exactly. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.0001, x=0.0001 is not included. Therefore, n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. So, n must be less than 3183.098, meaning n can be up to 3183, but 3183 gives x=0.0001, which is not included. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because 3182*\u03c0\u22483182*3.1415926535\u224810,000 - \u03c0\u22489999.99999, so 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.0001000001, which is just above 0.0001, so included in the interval.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that.\n\nIf n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001 exactly, which is excluded because the interval is open at 0.0001. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.0001000001, which is greater than 0.0001, so included.\n\nSimilarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.0009977, which is less than 0.001, so included.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nNow, let's compute the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nNumber of terms = 3182 -319 +1=3182-319=2863; 2863+1=2864.\n\nWait, so earlier I had 2865, but now I think it's 2864. Hmm, which is correct?\n\nWait, let's clarify.\n\nWhen n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009977 <0.001, so included.\n\nWhen n=3182, x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.0001000001 >0.0001, so included.\n\nn=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded.\n\nSo, n starts at 319 and ends at 3182.\n\nNumber of integers from a to b inclusive is b -a +1.\n\nSo, 3182 -319 +1=?\n\n3182 -319=2863\n\n2863 +1=2864.\n\nSo, the correct number is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so n goes up to 3182. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me double-check with specific examples.\n\nLet me take n=3182:\n\nx=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22481/(3182*3.1415926535)\u22481/(10000 - \u03c0)\u22481/9999.99999\u22480.0001000001, which is just above 0.0001, so included.\n\nn=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0)=1/10000=0.0001, excluded.\n\nn=319: x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22481/1002.3\u22480.0009977, which is less than 0.001, so included.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3182, inclusive.\n\nNumber of terms: 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nI think the mistake was in the initial calculation where I included n=3183, but since x=1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001 is excluded, n=3183 is not allowed. Therefore, the correct upper limit is n=3182, giving us 2864 x-intercepts.\n\nLet me confirm this with another approach.\n\nThe x-intercepts occur at x=1/(n\u03c0), where n is a positive integer such that 0.0001 <1/(n\u03c0)<0.001.\n\nTaking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities because reciprocals reverse inequalities for positive numbers):\n\n1/0.001 <n\u03c0 <1/0.0001\n\nWhich is 1000 <n\u03c0 <10000\n\nDivide by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 <n <10000/\u03c0\n\nCompute 1000/\u03c0\u2248318.309886184\n\n10000/\u03c0\u22483183.09886184\n\nSo, n must be integers strictly greater than 318.309886184 and strictly less than 3183.09886184.\n\nTherefore, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest integer n is 3183.\n\nWait, but wait: 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.09886184, so n must be less than that. So, the largest integer n is 3183, because 3183 <3183.09886184.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. So, is n=3183 allowed?\n\nWait, let's compute 1/(3183\u03c0):\n\n3183 * \u03c0\u22483183 *3.1415926535\u224810000.000 exactly?\n\nWait, 3183 * \u03c0=10000.000 exactly? Let me check:\n\n3183 * \u03c0=3183 *3.1415926535\u22483183*3.1415926535\n\nCompute 3183*3=9549\n\n3183*0.1415926535\u22483183*0.1=318.3\n\n3183*0.0415926535\u22483183*0.04=127.32\n\n3183*0.0015926535\u22485.08\n\nAdding up: 318.3 +127.32=445.62 +5.08\u2248450.7\n\nSo total\u22489549 +450.7\u224810,000. So, 3183*\u03c0\u224810,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001 exactly.\n\nBut since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.0001, x=0.0001 is not included. Therefore, n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the largest n is 3182.\n\nWait, but according to the inequality, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so n can be up to 3183, but since n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, we must take n up to 3182.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is from n=319 to n=3182 inclusive.\n\nNumber of terms: 3182 -319 +1=3182-319=2863; 2863+1=2864.\n\nSo, the correct number is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 3183 was allowed, but now I see it's not because x=0.0001 is excluded. So, the correct count is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach.\n\nThe function sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. The number of zeros between a and b is roughly the number of times 1/x passes through multiples of \u03c0. So, between x=a and x=b, the number of zeros is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - floor(1/(b\u03c0)).\n\nWait, let me think about that.\n\nThe number of zeros in (a, b) would be the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (a, b). So, the number of such n is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - floor(1/(b\u03c0)).\n\nWait, but let's compute that.\n\nGiven a=0.0001 and b=0.001.\n\nCompute 1/(a\u03c0)=1/(0.0001\u03c0)=10000/\u03c0\u22483183.09886184\n\nCompute 1/(b\u03c0)=1/(0.001\u03c0)=1000/\u03c0\u2248318.309886184\n\nSo, the number of integers n such that 318.309886184 <n <3183.09886184 is floor(3183.09886184) - ceil(318.309886184) +1.\n\nWait, no, the number of integers between m and n exclusive is floor(n) - ceil(m) +1.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nNumber of integers strictly greater than m and strictly less than n is floor(n-1) - ceil(m).\n\nBut I might be confusing the formula.\n\nAlternatively, the number of integers n satisfying m <n <N is floor(N-1) - ceil(m).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute floor(1/(a\u03c0))=floor(3183.09886184)=3183\n\nceil(1/(b\u03c0))=ceil(318.309886184)=319\n\nSo, the number of integers n such that 319 \u2264n \u22643183 is 3183 -319 +1=2865.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so perhaps the formula is slightly different.\n\nWait, the formula counts n from ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) to floor(1/(a\u03c0)), inclusive. So, that would be 3183 -319 +1=2865.\n\nBut in reality, n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so we should subtract 1, giving 2864.\n\nWait, but the formula floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) +1 gives 3183 -319 +1=2865, but since x=1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001 is excluded, the actual count is 2865 -1=2864.\n\nSo, the correct number is 2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nSolving for n:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000  \n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0  \n\u2248318.31 < n < \u22483183.098\n\nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3183. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. However, since x=1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001 is excluded, we subtract 1, resulting in 2864 x-intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2864}$"

    "text": " Let me solve for n. Taking reciprocals on both sides (and remembering that reversing inequalities when taking reciprocals), so 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. 1/0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, I get n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute 10000 divided by \u03c0. Since \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n < approximately 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, the maximum integer n can be is 3183. Now, let's take the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184. Since n must be an integer, the smallest integer n can be is 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to count the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add one (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the inequalities: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.

    "text": " Let's invert both sides, remembering that inverting reverses the inequality when both sides are positive. So, 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. 1/0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0, which means n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating that, \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n is an integer, n \u2264 3183.\n\nNow, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, inverting both sides, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618. Since n is an integer, n \u2265 319.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is given by b - a + 1. So, plugging in the numbers: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that step by step. 3183 - 319 is equal to 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n in this range, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, starting with the inequalities:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618, so n \u2264 3183.\n\n1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u21d2 n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, so n \u2265 319.\n\nSo, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319 first. 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more, which is 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, I should check if the endpoints are included or excluded. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. So, I need to make sure that 1/(n\u03c0) is strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. So, if n were such that 1/(n\u03c0) = 0.0001, that would correspond to n = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. But since n has to be an integer, the maximum n is 3183, which gives x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. Similarly, the minimum n is 319, which gives x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000978, which is just below 0.001, so it's included. So, yes, all these n's are valid, and the count is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check with n=319: 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.14) \u2248 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001, so that's okay. And n=3183: 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0003) \u2248 0.0000999999, which is just above 0.0001, so that's also okay. So, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive are valid, giving 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, leading to x = 1/(n\u03c0). We find the integers n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which gives n between 319 and 3183. The count of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

To find n, divide all parts by \u03c0. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values numerically. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, n must satisfy 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184. Therefore, n can take integer values from 319 up to 3183.

So, there are 2865 integer values of n in this range, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 1000/\u03c0 is approximately 318.31, so the next integer is 319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 is approximately 3183.098, so the last integer is 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 minus 300 is 2883, minus 19 more is 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the number of integers between a and b is floor(b) - ceil(a) + 1. In this case, ceil(318.31) is 319, and floor(3183.098) is 3183.

Therefore, combining both inequalities: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Now, I can divide all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n. Let's compute 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 1000/\u03c0 is roughly 1000 divided by 3.1416, which is approximately 318.3098861.

Then, 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988, so the integer part is 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then minus 19 is 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 is 2865. Yeah, that seems correct. So, I think 2865 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we determine when \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\).

    "text": " Maybe it's easier to take reciprocals, but I have to remember that flipping inequalities when taking reciprocals reverses them because all terms are positive. So, taking reciprocals: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0, which is 10000 > n\u03c0. Similarly, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Taking reciprocals again: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is n\u03c0 > 1000. So now, I have two inequalities: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. To solve for n, I can divide all parts by \u03c0. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute those values. First, 1000 divided by \u03c0. Since \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 1000/3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 is 10000 divided by 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. But n has to be an integer because x-intercepts occur at integer multiples of \u03c0. So, n must be integers from the next integer after 318.309886184, which is 319, up to the integer just below 3183.09886184, which is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is given by b - a + 1. So, plugging in the numbers: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that. 3183 - 319 is 2864, and then adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31, so n starts at 319. 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n ends at 3183. The number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319 first. 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then minus 19 is 2864. Then 2864 + 1 is 2865. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But just to make sure, let me think about this another way. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. So, between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a pretty small interval, there should be a lot of oscillations. Each oscillation corresponds to a peak and a trough, and between each peak and trough, the function crosses the x-axis twice: once going up and once going down. Wait, no, actually, for sin(\u03b8), each period is 2\u03c0, and it crosses zero once per half-period. Wait, no, sin(\u03b8) crosses zero twice every period: once at \u03b8 = n\u03c0 and once at \u03b8 = (n+1)\u03c0. So, in each period of 2\u03c0, there are two zeros. But wait, actually, no. Let me clarify. The zeros of sin(\u03b8) occur at \u03b8 = n\u03c0, where n is an integer, and between each zero, the function goes from 0 up to 1 and back to 0, or 0 down to -1 and back to 0. So, between each zero, it's a half-period. So, the distance between two consecutive zeros is \u03c0. So, each zero is \u03c0 apart. So, in terms of \u03b8, the zeros are at \u03b8 = n\u03c0, so for \u03b8 between 1000 and 10000, as we found earlier, the number of zeros is approximately (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0. Wait, but that might not be exactly accurate because we're dealing with integer n. Let me see: the number of zeros is equal to the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must be from 319 to 3183, which is 2865 numbers. So, that's consistent with what I found earlier. So, I think 2865 is correct. Another way to think about it is that in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is from x = 0.0001 to x = 0.001, the corresponding \u03b8 = 1/x goes from 10000 to 1000. So, \u03b8 decreases from 10000 to 1000 as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001. So, we're looking at \u03b8 in the interval (1000, 10000). So, the number of zeros of sin(\u03b8) in \u03b8 from 1000 to 10000 is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which is exactly the same as before. So, n from 319 to 3183, which is 2865. So, that's consistent. So, I think I can be confident that the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\):\n\n1. **Identify where \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\):**\n   - \\( \\sin(\\theta) = 0 \\) when \\( \\theta = n\\pi \\) for integer \\( n \\).\n   - Thus, \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) which gives \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n\n2. **Determine the range of \\( n \\) such that \\( x \\) is in \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\):**\n   - \\( 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\)\n   - Taking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities):\n     - \\( 1000 < n\\pi < 10000 \\)\n     - Dividing by \\( \\pi \\):\n       - \\( \\frac{1000}{\\pi} < n < \\frac{10000}{\\pi} \\)\n       - \\( 318.31 < n < 3183.098 \\)\n\n3. **Count the integers \\( n \\) in this range:**\n   - \\( n \\) ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n   - Number of integers = \\( 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 \\).\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\(\\boxed{2865}\\)."

So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n is an integer, n \u2264 3183. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Inverting both sides again, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is n\u03c0 > 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618.

Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1. Wait, no, let me think again. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in that interval.

Then, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. I think I didn't make any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer n.

Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618.

Again, take reciprocals, remembering to flip the inequality: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n\u03c0 > 1000. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, n > 1000/\u03c0.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then +1 is 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183, inclusive. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, let me double-check my calculations. Let's compute 3183 - 319. 3183 minus 300 is 2883, minus 19 is 2864. So, 2864 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct. So, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But wait, let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the initial setup. So, x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is between 10^-4 and 10^-3. Then, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. So, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, which implies x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, x must be between 1/(n\u03c0) where n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000. So, n is between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.31 to 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.

So, putting it together: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Now, let's compute these values numerically. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000/\u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184.

Since n has to be an integer, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, we can compute 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's calculate that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n in that range. Each of these integers corresponds to an x-intercept in the given interval. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, let's confirm 1000/\u03c0: 1000 divided by approximately 3.14159265 is indeed about 318.31. So, n must be greater than that, so n starts at 319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 is about 3183.098, so n goes up to 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, then adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct. So, yes, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Alternatively, another way to think about it is to consider how many times the function oscillates between 0.0001 and 0.001. As x approaches zero, 1/x approaches infinity, so the function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. The number of oscillations is roughly proportional to the change in 1/x over the interval. Let me see: when x goes from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x goes from 10000 to 1000. So, the total change in 1/x is 9000. Since each oscillation (each period) of sin is 2\u03c0, the number of zeros (x-intercepts) would be approximately the number of periods, which is total change divided by \u03c0. So, 9000 / \u03c0 \u2248 2866.19. Hmm, wait, that's close to 2865, which is what I got earlier. The slight difference is because the exact number of zeros is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0) + 1. Let me compute floor(10000/\u03c0): 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so floor is 3183. ceil(1000/\u03c0) is ceil(318.309) which is 319. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that's consistent.

Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, applying that here: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that. 3183 minus 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Each of these integers corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0) within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319 first. 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more, which gives 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct. Also, let me check the initial inequalities. For n=319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.006) \u2248 0.000997, which is just below 0.001, so it's within the interval. For n=3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.00001) \u2248 0.0001, but wait, 0.0001 is the lower bound, which is not included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, is x=1/(3183\u03c0) equal to 0.0001? Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0). 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 let's see, 3000\u03c0 is about 9424.77796, and 183\u03c0 is about 574.87712, so total is approximately 9424.77796 + 574.87712 \u2248 10,000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, does x=0.0001 count? No, because it's not included. So, does that mean n=3183 is not included? Wait, but n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but it's excluded. So, does that mean n should go up to 3182? Let me check. So, if n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001, which is not included, then the maximum n should be 3182. Let me compute x for n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0). 3182\u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.14159265 \u2248 let's compute 3000\u03c0\u22489424.77796, 182\u03c0\u2248572.348, so total\u22489424.77796 + 572.348\u224810,000. So, 3182\u03c0\u22489999.9999, so 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.0001000001, which is just above 0.0001, so it is included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3182 gives x\u22480.0001000001, which is within the interval. So, n goes from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Let me recalculate the number of integers: 3182 - 319 +1. 3182 - 319 is 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001, which is excluded, so n goes up to 3182. So, the count is from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864. Hmm, so I think I made a mistake earlier by including n=3183, which gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. So, the correct number should be 2864. Let me confirm with another approach. The x-intercepts occur at x=1/(n\u03c0) for integer n. The interval is 0.0001 < x < 0.001. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities): 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. So, n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248318.30988618, and n <10000/\u03c0\u22483183.0988618. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183, but since n must be less than 3183.0988618, the maximum integer n is 3183, but as we saw earlier, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is excluded. So, n must be less than or equal to 3182. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 -319 +1. Let me compute that again: 3182 -319 is 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so n=3183 is not included. Therefore, the correct count is 2864. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider whether n=3183 is included or not. Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0). Let's compute 3183 * \u03c0. 3183 * 3.14159265. Let me compute 3000\u03c0=9424.77796, 183\u03c0\u2248574.87712, so total is 9424.77796 + 574.87712\u224810,000. So, 3183\u03c0\u224810,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is exactly the lower bound. Since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, x=0.0001 is not included, so n=3183 is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, which gives x\u22480.0001000001, which is included. So, the number of x-intercepts is 3182 -319 +1=2864. Therefore, the final answer is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer n. We need to find the number of such x in (0.0001, 0.001). Solving for n, we find n ranges from 319 to 3182, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 2864.\n\n\\boxed{2864}"

Then, 1000 / \u03c0 is approximately 318.309886184, so the minimum integer n is 319. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1.

Dividing both sides by \u03c0, we get n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute 10000 divided by \u03c0. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000/3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618.

So, 10000/\u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. Similarly, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. So, from the first inequality, n < 3183.0988618, and from the second, n > 318.30988618. But n has to be an integer, so n must be greater than 318.30988618 and less than 3183.0988618. Since n is an integer, the smallest possible n is 319 and the largest possible n is 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, let's compute 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me calculate that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, and then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I found that n must be greater than 318.3098 and less than 3183.0988. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. Now, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nJust to make sure, let's check the endpoints. For n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.098) \u2248 0.0009969, which is less than 0.001 and greater than 0.0001, so it's within the interval. For n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) \u2248 0.0001, but wait, 0.0001 is the lower bound of the interval, which is excluded. So, actually, x must be greater than 0.0001, so x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, which is equal to 0.0001, but our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open. So, does n = 3183 give x = 1/(3183\u03c0) which is approximately 0.0001, but since 0.0001 is excluded, maybe n = 3183 is not included.\n\nWait, that's a good point. Let me re-examine the inequalities. We had 0.0001 < x < 0.001, and x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me solve these again for n.\n\nStarting with 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001 = 10000. Therefore, n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than 3183.0988618, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but since 3183.0988618 is just a bit more than 3183, n can be 3183 because 3183 < 3183.0988618. Wait, no, n must be less than 3183.0988618, so the maximum integer n is 3183, because 3183 is less than 3183.0988618. Similarly, for the lower bound: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which implies n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. But we also have the other inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which implies n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than 318.30988618, so the smallest integer n is 319.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but 0.0001 is excluded. Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0) numerically to check. Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0 first. 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 Let me compute 3000 * 3.1416 = 9424.8, and 183 * 3.1416 \u2248 183 * 3 = 549, 183 * 0.1416 \u2248 25.9848, so total \u2248 549 + 25.9848 \u2248 574.9848. So, total 9424.8 + 574.9848 \u2248 9999.7848. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.7848, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.7848 \u2248 0.00010000216. Hmm, so that's approximately 0.00010000216, which is just a bit more than 0.0001. Since our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so 0.0001 is excluded, but 0.00010000216 is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, n = 3183 is acceptable because x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010000216 is greater than 0.0001. So, n can go up to 3183.\n\nSimilarly, for n = 319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 Let's compute 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477, and 19\u03c0 \u2248 59.690, so total \u2248 942.477 + 59.690 \u2248 1002.167. So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.167 \u2248 0.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval.\n\nSo, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, inclusive. Now, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, and 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if n = 3183 is indeed within the interval. As I calculated, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010000216, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n = 319 gives x \u2248 0.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, both endpoints are included, so the count is correct.\n\nWait, but another thought: since the interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), does that affect anything? Because 0.0001 is excluded, but we saw that 1/(3183\u03c0) is just above 0.0001, so it's included. Similarly, 0.001 is excluded, but the maximum x in the interval is approaching 0.001 from below. Wait, but in our case, the maximum n is 319, which gives x \u2248 0.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, all the x-intercepts are within the open interval.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that for n = 319, x is less than 0.001. As I calculated, x \u2248 0.0009978, which is indeed less than 0.001. So, it's included. Similarly, for n = 3183, x \u2248 0.00010000216, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. So, both ends are correctly included.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about whether there's any possibility that some x-values might be outside the interval. For example, could n be such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001 or 0.001? Let's check.\n\nIf x = 0.0001, then 1/x = 10000, so sin(10000) = 0. So, 10000 = n\u03c0, so n = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618, which is not an integer. So, there's no integer n such that x = 0.0001, so that point is excluded, which is correct because the interval is open. Similarly, x = 0.001 would imply 1/x = 1000, so sin(1000) = 0, so n\u03c0 = 1000, so n = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, which is not an integer. So, there's no integer n such that x = 0.001, which is also excluded, so our count remains correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

Calculating that: 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 318.30988618. So, n > approximately 318.30988618. Since n must be an integer, n \u2265 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the numbers: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n in this range. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, 10000/\u03c0 is indeed approximately 3183.0988, so n must be less than that, so n \u2264 3183. Then, 1000/\u03c0 is approximately 318.3098, so n must be greater than that, so n \u2265 319. Then, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more to get 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of x-intercepts of \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we find where \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\).

    "text": " Let's take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that flipping the inequality when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive. So, 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. 1/0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0: n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute 10000 divided by \u03c0. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n is an integer, n \u2264 3183.\n\nNow, let's take the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, take reciprocals, remembering to flip the inequality: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001. 1/0.001 is 1000, so n\u03c0 > 1000. Therefore, n > 1000/\u03c0. Let me compute 1000 / \u03c0. 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618. Since n is an integer, n \u2265 319.\n\nSo, n must be an integer such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Now, I need to count how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, let me compute 3183 - 319 + 1. 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n in that range, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's verify the bounds again.\n\nStarting with x = 1/(n\u03c0), and 0.0001 < x < 0.001. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nFor the lower bound: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u2192 n\u03c0 < 10000 \u2192 n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n \u2264 3183.\n\nFor the upper bound: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u2192 n\u03c0 > 1000 \u2192 n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n \u2265 319.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, and 2864 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure that x = 1/(n\u03c0) is indeed within the interval (0.0001, 0.001) for n = 319 and n = 3183.\n\nLet me check for n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(319*3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(1002.28) \u2248 0.0009977, which is just under 0.001, so it's within the interval.\n\nFor n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183*3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000.0988618) \u2248 0.000099999, which is just above 0.0001, so it's within the interval.\n\nWait, but 0.000099999 is actually less than 0.0001, which is 0.0001. So, 0.000099999 is less than 0.0001, which is 0.0001. So, that would actually be outside the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Hmm, so maybe n = 3183 gives x just below 0.0001, which is outside the interval. So, perhaps n should be less than or equal to 3182 instead.\n\nWait, let me compute x when n = 3183: 1/(3183\u03c0). Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0. 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let's compute 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, and 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 574.3154. So, total is approximately 9424.77796 + 574.3154 \u2248 10,000.09336. So, 1/(10,000.09336) \u2248 0.000099999, which is 0.000099999, which is less than 0.0001 (which is 0.0001). So, that x is actually less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. Therefore, n = 3183 is too big because x would be less than 0.0001. So, the maximum n for which x is still greater than 0.0001 is n = 3182.\n\nLet me check n = 3182: x = 1/(3182\u03c0). Compute 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 182 * \u03c0 \u2248 571.865. So, total \u2248 9424.77796 + 571.865 \u2248 9996.64296. So, 1/9996.64296 \u2248 0.000100034, which is just over 0.0001, so that's within the interval.\n\nSo, n can be up to 3182. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Now, let's compute the number of integers between 319 and 3182 inclusive.\n\nThe number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3182 - 319 + 1 = 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 = 2864. So, that's 2864 integers.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n could go up to 3183, but that gave x just below 0.0001, which is outside the interval. So, the correct upper bound for n is 3182, leading to 2864 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me check again: when n = 3183, x \u2248 0.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, the maximum n is 3182, giving x \u2248 0.000100034, which is just above 0.0001, so included.\n\nSo, n starts at 319 and ends at 3182. The number of terms is 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\nLet me compute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863. Then, adding 1 gives 2864.\n\nTherefore, there are 2864 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 319 to 3183 gives 2865, but upon correction, it's 319 to 3182, which is 2864. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial calculation.\n\nWait, let me compute 3182 - 319 + 1 again. 3182 - 319 is 2863, plus 1 is 2864. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to compute the number of integers between a and b inclusive is floor(b) - ceil(a) + 1.\n\nWait, but in this case, a is 319 and b is 3182, so it's straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the number of n's such that n > 318.30988618 and n < 3183.0988618.\n\nSo, n must be an integer greater than 318.30988618, so the smallest integer n is 319.\n\nAnd n must be less than 3183.0988618, so the largest integer n is 3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x just below 0.0001, which is outside the interval. So, perhaps n must be less than or equal to 3182.\n\nWait, but if I consider that n must satisfy x > 0.0001, which is 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, so n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618, so n can be up to 3183, but when n=3183, x is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, n must be less than or equal to 3182.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which gives 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should think about it differently. Let me compute the lower bound: n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, so the smallest integer n is 319.\n\nThe upper bound: n must be less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618, so the largest integer n is 3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the largest n is 3182.\n\nSo, n starts at 319 and ends at 3182, which is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 3183 - 319 +1 was 2865, but that included n=3183, which is outside the interval, so it's actually 2864.\n\nWait, let me check: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it as follows: the number of integers between a and b is approximately (b - a)/1, but since they're consecutive integers, it's exactly b - a +1.\n\nSo, from 319 to 3182, that's (3182 - 319) +1 = 2864.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me compute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863. Then, 2863 +1 = 2864.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should check with specific examples. Let's say n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009977, which is less than 0.001 and greater than 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nn=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100034, which is greater than 0.0001, so included.\n\nn=3183: x\u22480.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so excluded.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when n=319, x\u22480.0009977, which is within (0.0001, 0.001). When n=3182, x\u22480.000100034, which is just above 0.0001, so included. So, all n from 319 to 3182 inclusive give x in (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nThus, the number of x-intercepts is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but that was a mistake because n=3183 is excluded. So, the correct count is 2864.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use a different approach. Let's consider the function y = sin(1/x). The x-intercepts occur where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nSo, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nTaking reciprocals (and flipping inequalities):\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nDividing by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nCompute 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, so n > 318.30988618, so n \u2265 319.\n\nCompute 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618, so n < 3183.0988618, so n \u2264 3183.\n\nBut as we saw, n=3183 gives x\u22480.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, n must be \u22643182.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. The number of integers is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check another way: the number of integers between 319 and 3182 inclusive is equal to (3182 - 319) +1 = 2863 +1 = 2864.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 is 2864.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the number of integers between 319 and 3182 inclusive is the same as the number of integers from 1 to 3182 minus the number from 1 to 318. So, 3182 - 318 = 2864. Wait, no, that's not correct because 3182 - 318 = 2864, but that would be if we were counting from 319 to 3182 as 3182 - 318 = 2864, but that's not the case because from 1 to 3182 is 3182 numbers, and from 1 to 318 is 318 numbers, so 3182 - 318 = 2864, which is the number of numbers from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, that confirms it.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with n=319 and n=3182:\n\nFor n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.28) \u2248 0.0009977, which is within (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nFor n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.09886) \u2248 0.000099999, which is just below 0.0001, so it's excluded. Wait, no, that's not correct because 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.09886) \u2248 0.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. Therefore, n=3182 gives x\u22480.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Wait, that contradicts my earlier calculation. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in computing 3182\u03c0. Let me compute 3182 * \u03c0 more accurately.\n\n\u03c0 \u2248 3.141592653589793.\n\nSo, 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.141592653589793.\n\nLet me compute 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796077.\n\n182 * \u03c0 \u2248 182 * 3.141592653589793 \u2248 Let's compute 100 * \u03c0 \u2248 314.1592653589793, 80 * \u03c0 \u2248 251.32741228718345, and 2 * \u03c0 \u2248 6.283185307179586.\n\nSo, 100\u03c0 \u2248 314.1592653589793\n\n80\u03c0 \u2248 251.32741228718345\n\n2\u03c0 \u2248 6.283185307179586\n\nSo, 182\u03c0 \u2248 314.1592653589793 + 251.32741228718345 + 6.283185307179586 \u2248 314.1592653589793 + 251.32741228718345 = 565.48667764616275 + 6.283185307179586 \u2248 571.7698629533423.\n\nSo, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796077 + 571.7698629533423 \u2248 10,000.547823723342.\n\nWait, so 3182\u03c0 \u2248 10,000.547823723342.\n\nTherefore, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/10,000.547823723342 \u2248 0.00009999457, which is approximately 0.00009999457, which is less than 0.0001 (which is 0.0001 exactly). So, 0.00009999457 is less than 0.0001, so x=1/(3182\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. Therefore, n=3182 also gives x outside the interval.\n\nWait, that changes things. So, if n=3182 gives x\u22480.00009999457, which is less than 0.0001, then the maximum n that gives x > 0.0001 is n=3181.\n\nWait, let me check n=3181: 3181\u03c0 \u2248 3181 * 3.141592653589793.\n\nCompute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796077.\n\n181\u03c0 \u2248 181 * 3.141592653589793 \u2248 Let's compute 100\u03c0 \u2248 314.1592653589793, 80\u03c0 \u2248 251.32741228718345, and 1\u03c0 \u2248 3.141592653589793.\n\nSo, 100\u03c0 \u2248 314.1592653589793\n\n80\u03c0 \u2248 251.32741228718345\n\n1\u03c0 \u2248 3.141592653589793\n\nSo, 181\u03c0 \u2248 314.1592653589793 + 251.32741228718345 + 3.141592653589793 \u2248 314.1592653589793 + 251.32741228718345 \u2248 565.48667764616275 + 3.141592653589793 \u2248 568.6282702997525.\n\nSo, 3181\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796077 + 568.6282702997525 \u2248 10,000.4062310697525.\n\nTherefore, 1/(3181\u03c0) \u2248 1/10,000.4062310697525 \u2248 0.00009999597, which is still less than 0.0001.\n\nWait, so even n=3181 gives x\u22480.00009999597, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded.

Therefore, perhaps there's no n where x > 0.0001 except when n is less than 3183.0988618. Wait, but that can't be because when n=3182, x\u22480.00009999457, which is less than 0.0001, so actually, there is no integer n such that x > 0.0001. Wait, that can't be right because when n=1, x=1/\u03c0\u22480.318, which is greater than 0.0001, but in our case, we're only considering n where x is in (0.0001, 0.001). So, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier reasoning.\n\nWait, no, let me think again. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001). So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001.\n\nSo, 0.0001 < x < 0.001.\n\nSince x = 1/(n\u03c0), we have 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nTaking reciprocals:\n\n10000 > n\u03c0 > 1000.\n\nSo, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nTherefore, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nCompute 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, so n must be greater than 318.30988618, so the smallest integer n is 319.\n\nCompute 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618, so n must be less than 3183.0988618, so the largest integer n is 3183.\n\nBut when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded.

Wait, that can't be, because 1/(3182\u03c0) should be slightly larger than 1/(3183\u03c0), so if n=3183 gives x\u22480.000099999, then n=3182 should give x\u22480.000100000 something, which is just above 0.0001.\n\nWait, perhaps my calculation was off.

Therefore, there is no integer n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001). That can't be right because when n=319, x\u22480.0009977, which is within the interval.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

So, perhaps the x-values decrease as n increases, but when n increases beyond a certain point, x becomes less than 0.0001. So, the x-intercepts start at n=319, x\u22480.0009977, and as n increases, x decreases, passing through x=0.0001 at some point.\n\nWait, so perhaps the x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) are those where n is such that x=1/(n\u03c0) is between 0.0001 and 0.001.\n\nSo, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nSo, n must be integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive.\n\nBut as we saw, n=3183 gives x\u22480.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded.

Let me clarify:\n\nWe have 0.0001 < x < 0.001, and x=1/(n\u03c0).\n\nSo, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nTaking reciprocals:\n\n10000 > n\u03c0 > 1000.\n\nSo, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nThus, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.30988618 and less than 3183.0988618.\n\nSo, n can be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nBut when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded.\n\nSimilarly, n=3182 gives x\u22480.00009999457, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded.\n\nWait, so how is that possible? If n=319 gives x\u22480.0009977, which is within the interval, and as n increases, x decreases, but at some point, x drops below 0.0001. So, perhaps the maximum n for which x > 0.0001 is when n= floor(10000/\u03c0) = 3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x\u22480.000099999, which is less than 0.0001. So, perhaps the maximum n is 3182, but n=3182 gives x"

Taking reciprocals on both sides (and remembering that inequality flips when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive), we get: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0 Which is 10000 > n\u03c0. So, n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me calculate that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is about 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n < approximately 3183.0988618. Since n must be an integer, n \u2264 3183. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, take reciprocals, flipping the inequality: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001 = 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n > approximately 318.30988618. Since n must be an integer, n \u2265 319. So, putting it together, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, it's 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then plus 1 is 2865. Wait, is that right? Let me check: 319 to 3183. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, but since both ends are inclusive, we add 1, so 2865. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. Let me double-check the initial substitution. We had x = 1/(n\u03c0), and 0.0001 < x < 0.001. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, solving for n: from 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, we get n < 1/(0.0001 * \u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988, so n \u2264 3183. From 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, we get n > 1/(0.001 * \u03c0) \u2248 318.3098, so n \u2265 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n in that range, each corresponding to an x-intercept in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But wait, let me think again. Is each n giving a unique x in the interval? Yes, because as n increases, x decreases, so each n corresponds to a unique x. So, the number of x-intercepts should be 2865. But wait, let me check with specific numbers to make sure. Let me compute x when n=319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.0) \u2248 0.000998, which is just above 0.0001, right? Wait, 0.000998 is 0.000998, which is 0.000998, which is less than 0.001 and greater than 0.0001, so it's within the interval. Now, for n=3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, but since n=3183 is less than 3183.0988, so x is just a bit more than 0.0001, which is still within the interval. So, all these x's are within (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me check if n=319 is indeed the first integer where x is less than 0.001. Let's compute 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098, so n=319 is the smallest integer where x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000998 < 0.001. Similarly, n=3183 is the largest integer where x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010001, which is just above 0.0001. So, yes, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which gives 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 intercepts. Therefore, the answer should be 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integers n. Solving for x gives x = 1/(n\u03c0).

    "text": " Let's solve for n. Taking reciprocals on both sides (and remembering that inequality signs flip when taking reciprocals since all terms are positive), we get: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0 So, 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, we get n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me calculate that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n < approximately 3183.0988618. Since n must be an integer, the maximum integer n can be is 3183. Now, let's look at the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals on both sides, remembering to flip the inequality: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001. That is, n\u03c0 > 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0.

So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. Now, to find how many integers are in this range, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n in that range, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. I know that as x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. So, in the interval from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is a small interval near zero, the function sin(1/x) will oscillate a lot, crossing the x-axis many times. Each time 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0, the function crosses zero. So, the number of zeros should correspond to how many multiples of \u03c0 are between 1/0.001 and 1/0.0001. Let's compute 1/0.001 = 1000 and 1/0.0001 = 10000. So, we're looking for the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Wait, that seems a bit different from what I did earlier. Wait, no, actually, when x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000, so \u03b8 = 1/x is in (1000, 10000). So, sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 = n\u03c0, where n is an integer. Therefore, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, let's solve for n: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, that seems consistent. But wait, earlier I thought about x being between 0.0001 and 0.001, and I got n from 319 to 3183, which gives 2865 intercepts. So, that seems correct. Let me just check with a smaller example to see if my reasoning holds. Suppose I take the interval (0.1, 0.2). Then 1/x is between 5 and 10. So, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so n\u03c0 must be between 5 and 10. So, n must be between 5/\u03c0 \u2248 1.5915 and 10/\u03c0 \u2248 3.1831. So, n can be 2, 3. So, two intercepts. Let me check: x = 1/(2\u03c0) \u2248 0.15915, which is between 0.1 and 0.2. Similarly, x = 1/(3\u03c0) \u2248 0.1061, which is also between 0.1 and 0.2. Wait, but 0.1061 is less than 0.1? Wait, no, 0.1061 is greater than 0.1, since 0.1 is 0.1000. So, both 1/(2\u03c0) \u2248 0.15915 and 1/(3\u03c0) \u2248 0.1061 are in (0.1, 0.2). So, that's two intercepts. According to my formula, n starts at 2 and goes up to 3, so number of intercepts is 3 - 2 + 1 = 2. That matches. So, my formula seems to work here. Therefore, going back to the original problem, n ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 intercepts. So, the answer should be 2865. But let me double-check my calculations to be sure. Let me compute 3183 - 319 + 1: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Correct. Alternatively, I can think of it as the number of integers between a and b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that's correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. For x in (0.0001, 0.001), 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. Thus, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, giving n from 319 to 3183. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

Now, let's look at the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Solving for n, again taking reciprocals and reversing the inequality: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001 = 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618. Since n is an integer, the smallest possible value for n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. To find the number of integers from a to b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the values: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and then adding 1 gives 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with the inequalities: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n, we get 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so dividing by \u03c0, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, that seems correct. But wait, let me make sure that 1/(319\u03c0) is indeed greater than 0.0001 and 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.001. Let's compute 1/(319\u03c0): 1/(319 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(1002.309) \u2248 0.0009976, which is approximately 0.0009976, which is just under 0.001. Wait, but our interval is up to 0.001, so 0.0009976 is less than 0.001, so that's correct. Now, checking 1/(3183\u03c0): 1/(3183 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000.098) \u2248 0.00009999, which is just above 0.0001, so that's correct. So, all the x-values from 1/(319\u03c0) down to 1/(3183\u03c0) lie within (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that when n increases beyond 3183, x becomes less than 0.0001? Wait, no, because as n increases, x = 1/(n\u03c0) decreases, so when n is 3184, x would be 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. So, n can only go up to 3183, which gives x \u2248 0.00009999, but wait, that's actually less than 0.0001, so that would be outside the interval. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought 1/(3183\u03c0) was approximately 0.00009999, which is 0.00009999, which is 9.999e-5, which is less than 0.0001 (which is 1e-4). So, that would mean that 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's actually outside the interval. Hmm, so that suggests that the maximum n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) is still greater than 0.0001. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the upper limit. Let me re-examine that.\n\nWait, let me compute 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, solving for n: n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183. But 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so that's outside the interval. Therefore, the maximum n should be such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which would mean n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, the maximum integer n is 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the maximum n where x = 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n = 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so actually, the maximum n where x > 0.0001 is n = 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) would be greater than 0.0001. Wait, let me compute 1/(3182\u03c0): 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.14159265 \u2248 3182 * 3 = 9546, 3182 * 0.14159265 \u2248 3182 * 0.1416 \u2248 450. So, total \u2248 9546 + 450 \u2248 9996. So, 1/9996 \u2248 0.00010004, which is just over 0.0001. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010004, which is greater than 0.0001, so that's within the interval. Therefore, n can go up to 3182, because n=3183 gives x less than 0.0001, which is outside. So, that changes things. Similarly, let's check the lower end. n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, so the smallest integer n is 319. So, now, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Now, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 is 2864. So, 2864 x-intercepts. Wait, but let me make sure. Let me compute 1/(319\u03c0) and 1/(3182\u03c0) to confirm.\n\n1/(319\u03c0): 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.14159265 \u2248 319 * 3 = 957, 319 * 0.14159265 \u2248 319 * 0.1416 \u2248 45.1. So, total \u2248 957 + 45.1 \u2248 1002.1. So, 1/1002.1 \u2248 0.0009979, which is less than 0.001, so that's within the interval. Good. Now, 1/(3182\u03c0): as above, approximately 0.00010004, which is just over 0.0001, so that's within the interval. Now, what about n=3183? 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. So, the maximum n is 3182. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, 2864 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n went up to 3183, but that was a mistake because 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001. So, the correct upper limit is n=3182, giving us 2864 intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me check if n=3182 is indeed within the interval. 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010004, which is greater than 0.0001, so yes, it's included. So, n=3182 is the last n where x is still greater than 0.0001. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial calculation where I thought it was 2865. It's easy to get confused with the inclusive counts. So, let's recast the problem: the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, if a=319 and b=3182, then the count is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863. Then, +1 gives 2864. So, yes, that's correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nBut wait, let me check with n=319: 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009979, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. n=3182: 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010004, which is just over 0.0001, so it's within the interval. So, all n from 319 to 3182 inclusive give x in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the count is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n could go up to 3183, but that gives x less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the correct count is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to make sure I'm not making a mistake in the counting. Suppose I have n from 2 to 5 inclusive. The numbers are 2,3,4,5. The count is 5 - 2 + 1 = 4, which is correct. So, applying the same formula here, 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864, which should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the number of integers between 319 and 3182 inclusive is the same as (3182 - 319) +1, which is 2863 +1 = 2864. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, I think the correct number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nBut wait, let me check once more. Let me compute 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, so n must be greater than that, so the first integer n is 319. Then, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618, so n must be less than that, so the last integer n is 3183, but as we saw, 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the last n is 3182, as 1/(3182\u03c0) is just over 0.0001. So, the number of integers is from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded, so the maximum n is 3182, giving 2864 intercepts. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me think about whether the endpoints are included or not. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009979, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. When n=3182, x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.00010004, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. So, both endpoints of the n range correspond to x within the interval, so the count is correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, n=3182 is the last valid n. So, 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 2864 numbers.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches zero. The number of oscillations between x=a and x=b can be found by considering how many times 1/x increases by 2\u03c0. So, the number of zeros would be roughly the number of times 1/x crosses multiples of \u03c0 between 1/b and 1/a. So, in this case, a=0.0001 and b=0.001, so 1/a=10000 and 1/b=1000. So, the number of zeros would be the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Which is the same as n between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.31 < n < 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, n goes up to 3182, making the count 3182 - 319 +1=2864.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the number of zeros is the number of times 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. Each crossing corresponds to a zero. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0\u2248318.30988618 and less than 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.0988618. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, giving x\u22480.00010004, which is included. So, the count is from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 +1=2864.\n\nWait, but let me think about whether I'm double-counting or missing any numbers. Let me take a small example. Suppose I have n from 2 to 5 inclusive. That's 2,3,4,5, which is 4 numbers. 5-2+1=4. So, the formula works. So, applying it here, 3182 - 319 +1=2864. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute the number of integers between 319 and 3182 inclusive by noting that the number of integers less than or equal to 3182 is 3182, and the number of integers less than 319 is 318. So, the number of integers between 319 and 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 318 = 2864. That's another way to see it.\n\nWait, that's a good point. So, the number of integers from 1 to 3182 is 3182, and the number of integers from 1 to 318 is 318. Therefore, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 is 3182 - 318 = 2864. So, that confirms it again.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but that was because I included n=3183, which gives x less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, the correct count is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. The function y = sin(1/x) has a period of 2\u03c0/(1/x) = 2\u03c0x. But as x approaches zero, the period becomes very small, so the function oscillates more and more rapidly. The number of zeros between x=a and x=b is approximately (1/a - 1/b)/(\u03c0). Because each zero occurs when 1/x increases by \u03c0. So, the number of zeros is roughly (1/a - 1/b)/\u03c0.\n\nIn this case, a=0.0001, b=0.001. So, 1/a=10000, 1/b=1000. So, (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 = 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.197. Hmm, that's approximately 2866. But our earlier calculation was 2864. There's a slight discrepancy here. Let me think about why.\n\nWait, because the exact number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0). So, floor(10000/\u03c0)=3183, ceil(1000/\u03c0)=319. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864. So, that matches our earlier calculation. The approximation (1/a - 1/b)/\u03c0 gives us about 2866, which is close but not exact because it's an approximation, whereas the exact count is 2864.\n\nSo, that further confirms that the exact number is 2864.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering and checking, I conclude that the number of x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2864.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

    "text": " Let me solve for n. If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that reversing inequalities when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive. So, 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. 1/0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, we get n < 10000/\u03c0. Similarly, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, take reciprocals: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001. 1/0.001 is 1000, so n\u03c0 > 1000. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, we get n > 1000/\u03c0. So, now I have n > 1000/\u03c0 and n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0 numerically to get a sense of the range of n. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000/\u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n must be greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184. So, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the values: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that. 3183 - 319 is 2864, and then +1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. Let me check the initial substitution again. We had x = 1/(n\u03c0), and x is between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals correctly reverses the inequalities, so n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000, so n is between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.31 to 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more is 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the number of integers from 1 to 3183 minus the number from 1 to 318. So, 3183 - 318 = 2865, which matches. So, yeah, 2865 x-intercepts. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Solving for n gives 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. The integers n range from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

Similarly, 1000/\u03c0 is about 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must satisfy 318.30988618 < n < 3183.0988618. Since n has to be an integer, n can take integer values from the next integer after 318.30988618, which is 319, up to the integer just below 3183.0988618, which is 3183. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think: the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Each of these n corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2865. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 10000/\u03c0 is approximately 3183.098, and 1000/\u03c0 is approximately 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319, and less than 3183.098, so the largest integer n is 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 minus 300 is 2883, minus 19 more is 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct. So, I think the answer is 2865 x-intercepts in that interval.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n.

Therefore, n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me calculate that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is about 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n is an integer, the maximum possible n is 3183. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, invert both sides: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001. 1/0.001 is 1000, so n\u03c0 > 1000. Therefore, n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618.

To find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 319 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 integers n in that range, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

    "text": " Let me solve for n. If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that flipping the inequality when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive, I get: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. So, 10000 > n\u03c0. Therefore, n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute 10000 divided by \u03c0. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n is an integer, n \u2264 3183. Now, let's take the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, take reciprocals, which will flip the inequality: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001. 1/0.001 is 1000, so n\u03c0 > 1000. Therefore, n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618. Since n is an integer, n \u2265 319. So, combining both inequalities, n must be an integer satisfying 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, substituting a = 319 and b = 3183, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Each such n corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but I should double-check if x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is indeed greater than 0.0001 and x = 1/(319\u03c0) is less than 0.001. Let me check x when n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.098) \u2248 0.0009969, which is approximately 0.001, but just slightly less. Wait, 0.0009969 is 0.0009969, which is 0.0009969, so that's less than 0.001, which is 0.001. So, it's within the interval. Now, for n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0001) \u2248 0.000099999999, which is just slightly less than 0.0001, but since 0.0001 is the lower bound and it's open, we need to check if x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.000099999999, which is 0.000099999999, which is 0.000099999999, which is less than 0.0001. Hmm, so that would be outside the interval. Wait, that's a problem because our initial calculation included n = 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's not in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, we need to adjust our range for n. So, let me recast the inequalities more accurately. We have 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let's solve for n in each inequality. First, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than this, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but as we saw, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.000099999999, which is less than 0.0001. Therefore, n must be such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618, so n \u2264 3183. But since x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, we need to find the smallest n such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, n must be less than 10000/\u03c0, but also, 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001. So, perhaps I should find the smallest integer n such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. Let's solve for n: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n can be up to 3183, but we need to check if 1/(3183\u03c0) > 0.0001. Wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 1/(10000.0001) \u2248 0.000099999999, which is 0.000099999999, which is less than 0.0001. So, that's not in the interval. Therefore, the maximum n such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n = 3183 - 1 = 3182. Let me check n = 3182: x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000 - something). Wait, 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 3182 * 3 = 9546, 3182 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3182 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 approximately 3182 * 0.1416 \u2248 3182 * 0.1 = 318.2, 3182 * 0.04 = 127.28, 3182 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0912, so total \u2248 318.2 + 127.28 + 5.0912 \u2248 450.5712. So, total 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 9546 + 450.5712 \u2248 9996.5712. Therefore, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.5712 \u2248 approximately 0.0001000345. So, that's just over 0.0001. Therefore, n = 3182 gives x \u2248 0.0001000345, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's within the interval. So, the maximum n is 3182. Similarly, let's check the lower end: n must be such that 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u21d2 n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n \u2265 319. Now, let's check n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(319 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(1003.0988618) \u2248 0.0009969, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3182. Now, let's compute the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive. The formula is (last - first) + 1. So, 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 gives 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. Let me double-check: 3182 - 319 = 2863, so 2863 +1 = 2864. So, that's 2864 integers. Wait, but earlier I had 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865, but that included n=3183, which was outside the interval, so I need to adjust that. So, the correct count is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864. Let me confirm that. For example, from 1 to 5 inclusive, 5-1=4, +1=5 numbers. Similarly, from 319 to 3182, it's 3182 - 319 = 2863, +1 = 2864 numbers. So, that's the number of x-intercepts. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me think again: when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009969, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. When n=3182, x\u22480.0001000345, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included. So, the number of n's is from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but that included n=3183 which was outside, so 2864 is correct. Let me just check with a smaller example to see if my counting is right. Suppose I have n from 2 to 5 inclusive. The numbers are 2,3,4,5. That's 4 numbers. Using the formula: 5-2=3, +1=4. Correct. So, in this case, 3182 - 319 = 2863, +1=2864. So, that's correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Alternatively, I can think of it as the number of integers n where 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3182, which is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864. So, that's my final answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3182. The number of integers in this range is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\n\\boxed{2864}"

So, 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0, which simplifies to 10000 > n\u03c0. Similarly, for the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, taking reciprocals gives n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, putting it together, n\u03c0 must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute those values. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926536. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926536 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926536 \u2248 3183.09886184. Now, since n must be an integer, n can take integer values from the smallest integer greater than 318.309886184 to the largest integer less than 3183.09886184. The smallest integer greater than 318.309886184 is 319, and the largest integer less than 3183.09886184 is 3183. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. Now, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, we can subtract 318 from 3183 and then adjust. Wait, actually, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so n starts at 319. 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so n ends at 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more, which gives 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, that seems correct. But just to make sure, let me think about it another way. The interval for n is between approximately 318.309886184 and 3183.09886184. So, the number of integer n's is the floor of 3183.09886184 minus the ceiling of 318.309886184, plus 1. So, floor(3183.09886184) is 3183, and ceiling(318.309886184) is 319. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.

    "text": " Maybe it's easier to take reciprocals, but I have to remember that flipping inequalities when taking reciprocals reverses them. So, taking reciprocals on all parts: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0 > 1/0.001 Wait, that might not be the best way. Let me think again. If 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0), then multiplying both sides by n\u03c0 (which is positive, so inequality sign remains the same) gives 0.0001 * n\u03c0 < 1. Then, dividing both sides by 0.0001, which is 1/10000, so 0.0001 is 1e-4, so 1/(1e-4) is 10000. So, 10000 * n\u03c0 < 1/(0.0001) which is 10000, wait, that seems confusing. Maybe another approach. Let's solve for n in both inequalities. Starting with 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 1/10000. Taking reciprocals (and flipping the inequality since reciprocals reverse the order for positive numbers): n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n < 10000/\u03c0. Similarly, the other inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Which is 1/(n\u03c0) < 1/1000. Taking reciprocals again: n\u03c0 > 1000, so n > 1000/\u03c0. So, putting it all together: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Now, n has to be an integer, so I need to find the number of integers between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0 numerically to find the range of n. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.30988618 and less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n must be an integer, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183. Now, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think: the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then 2864 + 1 is 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. I started by setting sin(1/x) = 0, which gives 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0).

    "text": " Let me solve for n. Taking reciprocals on both sides (and remembering that flipping the inequality when taking reciprocals since both sides are positive), I get: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0 So, 10000 > n\u03c0 Therefore, n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me calculate that: 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1416 \u2248 3183.098. So, n < approximately 3183.098. Since n is an integer, the maximum possible n is 3183. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Solving for n, take reciprocals again: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001 = 1000. So, n > 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.309. Since n must be an integer, the minimum possible n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. To find the number of integers from a to b inclusive, it's b - a + 1. So, substituting a = 319 and b = 3183, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when dealing with inequalities, especially with reciprocals, it's easy to make a mistake. So, let's verify the bounds again. Starting with x = 1/(n\u03c0). The lower bound is x > 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n\u03c0 < 10000 => n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, which is correct. The upper bound is x < 0.001, so 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n\u03c0 > 1000 => n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n starts at 319. So, n goes from 319 to 3183. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more to get 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, seems correct. But let me think again: when n is 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.8) \u2248 0.000996, which is just under 0.001, so that's included. For n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, does n=3183 give x=1/(3183\u03c0) which is approximately 0.0000999, which is less than 0.0001, so actually, n=3183 would give x just below 0.0001, which is outside the interval. Wait, that's a problem. So, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me recast the inequalities more carefully. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x must satisfy 0.0001 < x < 0.001. So, substituting x = 1/(n\u03c0), we have 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let's solve each inequality step by step.\n\nFirst inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Multiply both sides by n\u03c0 (which is positive, so inequality direction remains): 0.0001 * n\u03c0 < 1. Then, divide both sides by 0.0001: n\u03c0 < 1 / 0.0001 = 10000. So, n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.098, meaning the maximum integer n is 3183.\n\nSecond inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Multiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0. Then, divide both sides by 0.001: n\u03c0 > 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, the minimum integer n is 319.\n\nBut wait, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, x=0.0001 is excluded, so n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) which is slightly less than 0.0001, so it's actually just below 0.0001, which is outside the interval. Therefore, n=3183 is too big because x would be less than 0.0001, which is not allowed. So, the maximum n should be such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n\u03c0 < 10000 => n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n can be up to 3183, but when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182 because 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000 - \u03c0) \u2248 slightly more than 0.0001. Let me check: 3182\u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77, 182\u03c0 \u2248 571. So total \u2248 9424.77 + 571 \u2248 10,000 approximately? Wait, 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 let me compute 3182 * 3 = 9546, 3182 * 0.1416 \u2248 3182 * 0.1 = 318.2, 3182 * 0.04 = 127.28, 3182 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0912. Adding up: 318.2 + 127.28 = 445.48 + 5.0912 \u2248 450.57. So total is 9546 + 450.57 \u2248 9996.57. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.57 \u2248 0.000100034, which is just over 0.0001. So, x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100034, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. Therefore, n can go up to 3182. Similarly, for n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.8) \u2248 0.000996, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Wait, but earlier I thought n=319 gives x\u22480.000996, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3182. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 gives 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but now I'm getting 2864 because n goes up to 3182 instead of 3183. Let me confirm this again. When n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. So, the range of n is from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 -19=2863. Then, +1 gives 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 is 2864. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, sometimes it's easy to miscount the number of terms in a sequence, so another way to think about it is: the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a +1. So, 3182 - 319 +1= 3182 -319=2863, +1=2864. So, 2864 x-intercepts. Therefore, the final answer should be 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Solving for x gives x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nThis leads to:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3182, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\n$\\boxed{2864}$"

    "text": " Maybe it's easier if I take reciprocals on both sides, but I have to remember that taking reciprocals reverses the inequality. So, 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. 1/0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Then, dividing both sides by \u03c0: 10000/\u03c0 > n. Similarly, for the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Taking reciprocals again, remembering to reverse the inequality: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n\u03c0 > 1000, meaning n > 1000/\u03c0. Let me calculate 1000/\u03c0. Since \u03c0 is approximately 3.14159265, so 1000 divided by that is roughly 318.3098861. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.3098861. Since n has to be an integer, n must be at least 319. Similarly, from the first inequality, n must be less than 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 3183.098861. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.098861. Since n is an integer, the maximum value n can take is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the values: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that. 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. So, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319 first. 3183 minus 300 is 2883, minus 19 more is 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, that's correct. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait a second, that seems like a lot. Let me think again. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches zero. In the interval from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is from 10^{-4} to 10^{-3}, the function is going to oscillate very rapidly. Each oscillation corresponds to a crossing from positive to negative or vice versa, so each zero crossing is an x-intercept. So, the number of x-intercepts would be proportional to the number of oscillations in that interval. Since 1/x goes from 1000 to 10000 as x goes from 0.001 to 0.0001, the function sin(1/x) completes (10000 - 1000)/ (2\u03c0) oscillations. Wait, that's another way to compute the number of zeros. The number of zeros would be approximately the change in (1/x) divided by \u03c0, since each zero occurs every \u03c0 interval. So, the change in (1/x) is 10000 - 1000 = 9000. So, the number of zeros would be approximately 9000 / \u03c0, which is roughly 2866. Hmm, that's close to the 2865 I calculated earlier. So, that seems consistent. So, I think my initial calculation is correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check if n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, n = 319, 320, ..., 3183. The number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again. 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, yes, that's correct. So, 2865 is the number of x-intercepts.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies strictly within (0.0001, 0.001). So, when n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0). Let me compute that. 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 1004. So, 1/1004 \u2248 0.000996, which is approximately 0.001, but just a bit less. Wait, 0.000996 is 0.000996, which is less than 0.001, so 0.000996 is within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0). 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000. So, 1/10000 is 0.0001, which is the lower bound of the interval. But wait, the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but since it's an open interval, we have to check if x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0). 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But is it greater than 0.0001? Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0 more accurately. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute that:\n\n3183 * 3 = 9549\n3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3\n3183 * 0.0415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32\n3183 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 Approximately 5.07\nSo, adding up: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.07 \u2248 450.69\nSo, total 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 9549 + 450.69 \u2248 9999.69. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.69, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.69 \u2248 0.000100003. So, that's just a bit more than 0.0001. So, 0.000100003 is greater than 0.0001, so x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is just inside the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, for n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1004 \u2248 0.000996, which is less than 0.001, so it's inside the interval. Therefore, both endpoints are included in the interval, so n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me check if n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000100003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. Similarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.000996, which is less than 0.001, so included. So, all n from 319 to 3183 are valid, giving 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure that when I compute the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, it's indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the number of zeros of sin(1/x) between a and b is approximately (1/a - 1/b)/\u03c0, because each zero occurs every \u03c0 interval in the argument. So, here, a = 0.0001, b = 0.001. So, 1/a = 10000, 1/b = 1000. So, the difference is 9000. Divided by \u03c0, that's approximately 9000/3.14159265 \u2248 2866.197. So, about 2866 zeros. But since we can't have a fraction of a zero, we take the integer part, which would be 2866. But wait, in my previous calculation, I got 2865. Hmm, that's a discrepancy of 1. Let me check where that might come from.\n\nWait, perhaps because when I computed n from 319 to 3183, I included both endpoints, but the formula (1/a - 1/b)/\u03c0 gives an approximate value that's slightly higher. Let me see: 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.197, so approximately 2866. But my exact count gave me 2865. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, let me think again. The number of zeros is equal to the number of times the argument 1/x crosses an integer multiple of \u03c0 as x increases from a to b. So, when x increases from a to b, 1/x decreases from 1/a to 1/b. So, the number of zeros is the number of times 1/x passes through n\u03c0 for integer n between 1/b and 1/a. So, the number of zeros is floor(1/a) - ceil(1/b) + 1? Wait, no, perhaps it's floor(1/a) - ceil(1/b) + 1 if the endpoints are included. Wait, let me think.\n\nWait, when x is just above a, 1/x is just below 1/a, and as x approaches b from below, 1/x approaches 1/b from above. So, the zeros occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) where n is an integer such that 1/(n\u03c0) is between a and b. So, n must satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) > a and 1/(n\u03c0) < b. So, n < 1/(a\u03c0) and n > 1/(b\u03c0). So, n must be integers between 1/(b\u03c0) and 1/(a\u03c0). So, the number of such integers is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) + 1.\n\nWait, let me test this with numbers. Here, a = 0.0001, so 1/(a\u03c0) \u2248 10000/3.14159265 \u2248 3183.098861. So, floor(1/(a\u03c0)) is 3183. Similarly, 1/(b\u03c0) where b = 0.001 is 1000/3.14159265 \u2248 318.3098861. So, ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) is 319. So, the number of integers n is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. So, the formula is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) + 1.\n\nSo, that gives 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865, which is the same as before. So, that's correct. The approximate method gave me 2866, but the exact count is 2865. So, the exact number is 2865.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

Let me compute that. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n is an integer, n \u2264 3183. Now, let's look at the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals and flipping the inequality: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Let me compute that. 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618. Since n is an integer, n \u2265 319. So, putting it all together, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then +1 gives 2865. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the inequalities. Let me verify. So, starting again: x must be greater than 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618, so n \u2264 3183. And x must be less than 0.001, so 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u21d2 n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, so n \u2265 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more, which is 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, 2865 integers. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me think again. Is this correct? Because as x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is from 10^{-4} to 10^{-3}, so 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. So, sin(1/x) will oscillate between -1 and 1, crossing zero each time 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0. So, the number of zeros should be approximately the number of multiples of \u03c0 in (1000, 10000). So, the number of zeros is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0). Let me compute that. 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618, so floor of that is 3183. 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, so ceil of that is 319. Therefore, the number of zeros is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but when I subtract, it's 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 gives 2865. So, yes, that seems correct. So, the function sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Hmm, that seems like a lot, but considering the function oscillates rapidly near zero, it's plausible. Let me just check with a smaller example to see if my method is correct. Suppose I take the interval (0.1, 0.2). Then, 1/x ranges from 5 to 10. So, sin(1/x) will cross zero when 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, n must satisfy 5 < n\u03c0 < 10 \u21d2 5/\u03c0 < n < 10/\u03c0. 5/\u03c0 \u2248 1.5915, so n starts at 2. 10/\u03c0 \u2248 3.1831, so n goes up to 3. So, n = 2 and 3. So, x = 1/(2\u03c0) \u2248 0.15915 and x = 1/(3\u03c0) \u2248 0.1061. Wait, but 0.1061 is less than 0.1, so it's outside the interval (0.1, 0.2). Hmm, so maybe my earlier approach isn't quite right. Wait, no, in this case, 1/(n\u03c0) must be in (0.1, 0.2). So, 0.1 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.2 \u21d2 5 < n\u03c0 < 10 \u21d2 5/\u03c0 < n < 10/\u03c0. So, n must be integers between 2 and 3, inclusive. So, n=2 and n=3. But wait, 1/(2\u03c0) \u2248 0.15915 is in (0.1, 0.2), but 1/(3\u03c0) \u2248 0.1061 is less than 0.1, so it's not in the interval. So, only n=2 gives a valid x in (0.1, 0.2). So, number of zeros is 1. But according to my earlier formula, it would be floor(10/\u03c0) - ceil(5/\u03c0) + 1. 10/\u03c0 \u2248 3.1831, floor is 3. 5/\u03c0 \u2248 1.5915, ceil is 2. So, 3 - 2 + 1 = 2. But in reality, only 1 zero. So, my formula overcounts by 1 in this case. Hmm, that suggests that perhaps the correct formula is floor(10/\u03c0) - ceil(5/\u03c0). Let me check: 3 - 2 = 1, which matches. So, maybe I should subtract without adding 1. So, in the original problem, perhaps the number of zeros is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0). Let me compute that: floor(10000/\u03c0) = 3183, ceil(1000/\u03c0) = 319. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864. Hmm, but in the small example, that gave the correct count of 1. So, perhaps the correct formula is floor(upper) - ceil(lower). So, in the original problem, 3183 - 319 = 2864. But wait, in the small example, that gave the correct count, but in the original problem, is that accurate? Let me think again. When I have x in (a, b), then 1/x is in (1/b, 1/a). So, the zeros occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0), so 1/(n\u03c0) must be in (a, b). So, 1/b < 1/(n\u03c0) < 1/a \u21d2 a < 1/(n\u03c0) < b \u21d2 1/b < n\u03c0 < 1/a \u21d2 (1/b)/\u03c0 < n < (1/a)/\u03c0. So, n must be integers strictly greater than (1/b)/\u03c0 and strictly less than (1/a)/\u03c0. So, n must satisfy (1/b)/\u03c0 < n < (1/a)/\u03c0. So, the number of integers n is floor((1/a)/\u03c0) - ceil((1/b)/\u03c0). Wait, in the small example, a=0.1, b=0.2, so 1/a=10, 1/b=5. So, (1/a)/\u03c0 \u2248 3.1831, (1/b)/\u03c0 \u2248 1.5915. So, n must be greater than 1.5915 and less than 3.1831. So, n=2 and 3. But when I plug into x, n=2 gives x\u22480.15915 which is in (0.1,0.2), but n=3 gives x\u22480.1061 which is less than 0.1, so not in the interval. So, only n=2 works. So, the number of n's is 2, but only 1 x in the interval. So, perhaps the formula counts n's, but not all n's correspond to x in the interval. So, perhaps the correct way is to find the number of n's where 1/(n\u03c0) is in (a, b). So, 1/(n\u03c0) > a \u21d2 n < 1/(a\u03c0), and 1/(n\u03c0) < b \u21d2 n > 1/(b\u03c0). So, n must be integers satisfying 1/(b\u03c0) < n < 1/(a\u03c0). So, the number of integers n is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) + 1, but only if 1/(n\u03c0) is within (a, b). Wait, but in the small example, that would give floor(10/\u03c0)=3, ceil(5/\u03c0)=2, so 3-2+1=2, but only 1 x in the interval. So, perhaps the formula is not directly applicable because some n's give x outside the interval. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) + 1, but only if 1/(n\u03c0) is in (a, b). Wait, in the small example, 1/(2\u03c0)\u22480.15915 is in (0.1,0.2), but 1/(3\u03c0)\u22480.1061 is not. So, n=2 works, n=3 doesn't. So, the number of valid n's is 1, but floor(10/\u03c0)=3, ceil(5/\u03c0)=2, so 3-2+1=2, which is incorrect. So, perhaps the formula needs adjustment. Maybe the correct approach is to compute the number of n's where 1/(n\u03c0) > a and 1/(n\u03c0) < b. So, n must satisfy 1/(b\u03c0) < n < 1/(a\u03c0). So, the number of integers n is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)). In the small example, floor(10/\u03c0)=3, ceil(5/\u03c0)=2, so 3-2=1, which is correct. So, in the original problem, floor(10000/\u03c0)=3183, ceil(1000/\u03c0)=319, so 3183 - 319=2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, which is correct? Let me think carefully. The number of integers between a and b exclusive is floor(b) - ceil(a). So, if I have a < n < b, the number of integers is floor(b - 1) - ceil(a) + 1? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me consider the small example again. a=0.1, b=0.2. So, 1/(n\u03c0) must be in (0.1, 0.2). So, n must satisfy 5 < n\u03c0 < 10 \u21d2 5/\u03c0 < n < 10/\u03c0 \u21d2 approximately 1.5915 < n < 3.1831. So, n can be 2 or 3. But when n=3, x=1/(3\u03c0)\u22480.1061, which is less than 0.1, so not in the interval. So, only n=2 works. So, the number of valid n's is 1. So, floor(10/\u03c0)=3, ceil(5/\u03c0)=2, so 3-2=1. So, that works. So, in the original problem, floor(10000/\u03c0)=3183, ceil(1000/\u03c0)=319, so 3183 - 319=2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, perhaps I was wrong before. Let me check with another example. Suppose the interval is (0.0002, 0.0003). So, x is between 0.0002 and 0.0003. Then, 1/x is between approximately 3333.333 and 5000. So, sin(1/x)=0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so x=1/(n\u03c0). So, 0.0002 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.0003 \u21d2 10000 < n\u03c0 < 50000 \u21d2 10000/\u03c0 < n < 50000/\u03c0. Let's compute 10000/\u03c0 \u22483183.0988618, 50000/\u03c0\u224815915.49431. So, n ranges from 3184 to 15915. So, the number of integers is 15915 - 3184 +1=12732. But using the formula floor(upper) - ceil(lower): floor(50000/\u03c0)=15915, ceil(10000/\u03c0)=3184, so 15915 - 3184=12731. But when I compute 15915 - 3184 +1=12732, which is one more. So, which is correct? Let me see: the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a +1. So, if n starts at 3184 and ends at 15915, the number is 15915 - 3184 +1=12732. So, in this case, the formula floor(upper) - ceil(lower) +1 gives the correct count. But in the previous small example, that would have given 3 - 2 +1=2, but only 1 was correct. So, perhaps the formula is: if 1/(n\u03c0) is strictly between a and b, then the number of n's is floor(1/a\u03c0) - ceil(1/b\u03c0). But in the small example, that gave 3 - 2=1, which was correct. So, perhaps the correct formula is floor(1/a\u03c0) - ceil(1/b\u03c0). So, in the original problem, floor(10000/\u03c0)=3183, ceil(1000/\u03c0)=319, so 3183 - 319=2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. But wait, in the small example, using this formula gave the correct count, but in the other example, it didn't. So, perhaps the confusion comes from whether the endpoints are included. Since the interval is open, (a, b), not including a and b, we need to ensure that 1/(n\u03c0) is strictly greater than a and strictly less than b. So, in the original problem, 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, n must be less than 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.0988618, so n=3183 is the largest integer where 1/(n\u03c0) >0.0001. Similarly, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0\u2248318.30988618, so n=319 is the smallest integer where 1/(n\u03c0) <0.001. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 +1=2865. But wait, in the small example, using this approach would have given n=2 and n=3, but n=3 gave x\u22480.1061 which is less than 0.1, so not in the interval. So, perhaps the issue is that when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00010000..., which is just above 0.0001, so included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.0009817, which is less than 0.001, so included. So, in the original problem, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive give x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, the count is 3183 - 319 +1=2865. But in the small example, n=3 gives x\u22480.1061 which is less than 0.1, so not in (0.1,0.2). So, in that case, the formula overcounts. So, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the number of n's where 1/(n\u03c0) is in (a, b), which is equivalent to n in (1/(b\u03c0), 1/(a\u03c0)). So, the number of integers n is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) +1, but only if 1/(n\u03c0) is in (a, b). Wait, but in the small example, that would give floor(10/\u03c0)=3, ceil(5/\u03c0)=2, so 3-2+1=2, but only n=2 works. So, perhaps the formula is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) +1, but we have to check if 1/(ceil(1/(b\u03c0))\u03c0) is less than b. Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to compute the number of zeros by considering the interval for \u03b8=1/x. So, when x is in (0.0001, 0.001), \u03b8=1/x is in (1000, 10000). So, \u03b8 ranges from 1000 to 10000. The zeros of sin(\u03b8) occur at \u03b8=n\u03c0, for integer n. So, the number of zeros is the number of integer n's such that 1000 < n\u03c0 <10000. So, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 <n<10000/\u03c0. So, n ranges from ceil(1000/\u03c0)=319 to floor(10000/\u03c0)=3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1=2865. So, that seems correct. But in the small example, \u03b8=1/x is in (5,10), so n must satisfy 5/\u03c0 <n<10/\u03c0, which is approximately 1.5915 <n<3.1831. So, n=2 and 3. But when n=3, \u03b8=3\u03c0\u22489.4248, which is less than 10, so 1/x=9.4248 \u21d2x\u22480.1061, which is less than 0.1, so not in the interval (0.1,0.2). So, only n=2 works. So, in that case, the number of zeros is 1, but according to the formula, it's 3 - 2 +1=2, which is incorrect. So, perhaps the formula works when the interval for \u03b8 is such that n\u03c0 doesn't cross the upper bound. Wait, in the small example, \u03b8=10 is the upper limit, and n=3\u03c0\u22489.4248 <10, so x=1/(3\u03c0)\u22480.1061 <0.1, which is outside. So, the problem is that the upper limit of \u03b8 is 10, which is greater than 3\u03c0, but x=1/(3\u03c0) is less than 0.1, which is the lower limit of x. So, perhaps the formula counts n's where \u03b8=n\u03c0 is within (a,b), but x=1/(n\u03c0) might not be within (x_a, x_b). Wait, no, because \u03b8=1/x, so \u03b8 in (\u03b8_a, \u03b8_b) corresponds to x in (1/\u03b8_b, 1/\u03b8_a). So, if \u03b8 is in (1000,10000), x is in (0.0001,0.001). So, in the original problem, \u03b8 ranges from 1000 to 10000, and the zeros occur at \u03b8=n\u03c0. So, n must satisfy 1000 <n\u03c0<10000 \u21d2n in (1000/\u03c0,10000/\u03c0). So, n from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of zeros is 3183 - 319 +1=2865. So, in this case, all n's correspond to x in (0.0001,0.001). Because for n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009817, which is less than 0.001, and for n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00010000, which is just above 0.0001. So, all these x's are within (0.0001,0.001). So, in the original problem, the formula works because the interval for \u03b8 is such that all n's correspond to x in the desired interval. However, in the small example, \u03b8 is in (5,10), but n=3 gives \u03b8=3\u03c0\u22489.4248, which is within (5,10), but x=1/(3\u03c0)\u22480.1061, which is less than 0.1, so outside the x interval. So, in that case, the formula overcounts. Therefore, the key is whether \u03b8=n\u03c0 is within (\u03b8_a, \u03b8_b) and x=1/(n\u03c0) is within (x_a, x_b). Since \u03b8=1/x, the two intervals are inverses. So, in the original problem, \u03b8 ranges from 1000 to 10000, so x ranges from 0.0001 to 0.001. So, for each n, \u03b8=n\u03c0 must be in (1000,10000), which ensures x=1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001,0.001). Therefore, in the original problem, the number of zeros is indeed 2865. So, I think I was correct initially, and the confusion came from the small example where the interval for \u03b8 caused some x's to be outside. But in the original problem, since \u03b8 is from 1000 to 10000, which is a range that doesn't cause x to cross the x interval boundaries, the formula works correctly.

    "text": " Let's solve for n. If I take reciprocals on both sides, I need to reverse the inequality because taking reciprocals reverses the order for positive numbers. So, 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. 1/0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Then, dividing both sides by \u03c0, n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me calculate that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 10000/3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n is an integer, the maximum possible value for n is 3183. Now, let's look at the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, but this time, since 0.001 is positive, the inequality reverses: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001. 1/0.001 is 1000, so n\u03c0 > 1000. Then, n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000/3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618. Since n is an integer, the smallest possible value for n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers, inclusive, I subtract the smaller from the larger and add one. So, 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me calculate that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, 1/0.0001 is indeed 10000, and 1/0.001 is 1000. Then, dividing by \u03c0, we get approximately 3183.0988618 and 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than 318.30988618, so n starts at 319, and less than 3183.0988618, so n goes up to 3183. Then, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. That seems correct. So, I think 2865 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, leading to x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 1/(n\u03c0) must be between 0.0001 and 0.001. Solving for n, we find n ranges from 319 to 3183. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

    "text": " Let me solve for n. Multiply both sides by n\u03c0 (since n is positive, the inequality sign doesn't change): 0.0001 * n\u03c0 < 1 Then, divide both sides by 0.0001\u03c0: n < 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) Let me compute that. 1 / 0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1416 \u2248 3183.098. So, n < approximately 3183.098. Since n has to be an integer, the maximum integer n can be is 3183. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Let's solve for n. Multiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, divide both sides by 0.001\u03c0: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) < n 1 / (0.001\u03c0) is 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.309. So, n > approximately 318.309. Since n has to be an integer, the smallest integer n can be is 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1. Wait, let me think again. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, solving for n in the inequalities: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities since reciprocals reverse the inequality for positive numbers), we get 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. That is, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing through by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, add 1: 2865. Yep, that seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.

Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait a second, let me double-check that. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is an open interval, meaning it doesn't include the endpoints. So, I need to make sure that x = 1/(n\u03c0) doesn't equal exactly 0.0001 or 0.001.

But n has to be an integer, so n \u2248 3183.0988618 is not an integer. Similarly, for 0.001: 1/(n\u03c0) = 0.001 implies n = 1/(0.001 * \u03c0) \u2248 318.30988618, which is also not an integer. So, none of the x-intercepts at x = 1/(n\u03c0) will coincide with the endpoints of the interval. Therefore, all the x-intercepts in the range n = 319 to n = 3183 are strictly inside the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, the number of x-intercepts is indeed 2865. Let me just confirm the calculation for the number of integers. The formula is (last - first) + 1. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, and 2864 + 1 = 2865. Yes, that seems correct.

Let me verify the calculations step by step.\n\nFirst, solving 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nStarting with the left inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Taking reciprocals: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0, which is 10000 > n\u03c0, so n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886. So, n can be up to 3183.\n\nRight inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals: n\u03c0 > 1000, so n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886. So, n starts from 319.\n\nThus, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me check if n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0). Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0). Since \u03c0\u22483.14159265, 3183\u03c0\u22483183*3.14159265. Let me compute that: 3183*3=9549, 3183*0.14159265\u22483183*0.1416\u22483183*0.1=318.3, 3183*0.0416\u2248132. So, total approx 318.3+132\u2248450.3. So, 3183\u03c0\u22489549 + 450.3\u22489999.3. So, 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22481/9999.3\u22480.000100007. Which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, for n=319, 319\u03c0\u2248319*3.14159265\u2248319*3=957, 319*0.14159265\u2248319*0.1416\u224845. So, total\u2248957+45\u22481002. So, 1/(319\u03c0)\u22481/1002\u22480.000998, which is just below 0.001, so it's included as well. So, both endpoints are included, so the count from n=319 to n=3183 is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if n=3183 is allowed. Since x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000100007, which is just above 0.0001, so yes, it's within the interval. Similarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.000998, which is just below 0.001, so it's included.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so it doesn't include the endpoints. So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, for n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.000998, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. For n=3183, x\u22480.000100007, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. So, both n=319 and n=3183 are included, so the count remains 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check if n=3183 is the last one. If n=3184, then x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22481/(3184*3.14159265)\u22481/(10000.000000...), which would be approximately 0.0001, but since 3184\u03c0\u224810000.000000..., so x\u22480.0001, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), x=0.0001 is excluded, so n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is just below 0.0001? Wait, no, 3184\u03c0\u224810000.000000..., so 1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0001, but since 3184\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000, 1/(3184\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001, which would be 0.00010000... something, but actually, 1/10000 is 0.0001, so 1/(3184\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001 because 3184\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000. So, 1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0001 - \u03b5, where \u03b5 is a small positive number. Therefore, x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0001 - \u03b5, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded from the interval. Therefore, n=3184 would give x just below 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the maximum n is 3183, as previously determined.\n\nSimilarly, for n=318, let's check n=318: 318\u03c0\u2248318*3.14159265\u2248318*3=954, 318*0.14159265\u2248318*0.1416\u224845. So, total\u2248954+45\u2248999. So, 1/(318\u03c0)\u22481/999\u22480.001001, which is just above 0.001, so it's excluded. Therefore, n=318 gives x\u22480.001001, which is outside the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the smallest n is 319, as previously determined.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything else. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely as x approaches 0, but in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a small interval near zero, the function oscillates very rapidly. Each time 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0, we get an x-intercept. So, the number of intercepts is the number of integers n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) lies in (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nSo, the calculation seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to n between 319 and 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

Each time 1/x crosses n\u03c0, we get a zero. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n between 1/(0.001\u03c0) and 1/(0.0001\u03c0).
