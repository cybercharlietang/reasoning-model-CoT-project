    "text": " Let's take the first inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides (and reverse the inequality because reciprocals reverse the inequality for positive numbers), I get: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0 => 10000 > n\u03c0. Similarly, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which gives: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001 => n\u03c0 > 1000. So, combining both inequalities, we have: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Now, dividing all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is about 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. But n has to be an integer because it's an integer multiple in the sine function. So, n must be integers starting from the next integer after 318.309886184, which is 319, up to the integer just below 3183.09886184, which is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is given by b - a + 1. So, plugging in a = 319 and b = 3183, we get 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n in this range. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, starting from x = 1/(n\u03c0), and we have x between 0.0001 and 0.001, which translates to n between approximately 318.31 and 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 minus 300 is 2883, minus 19 more is 2864. Then 2864 + 1 is 2865. That seems correct. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Solving for n gives approximately 318.31 < n < 3183.098, so n ranges from 319 to 3183. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that flipping the inequality when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive, I get: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Calculating 1/0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, which is approximately 3.1416, gives n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: 10000 \u00f7 3.1416 \u2248 3183.098. So, n < approximately 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, the maximum possible n is 3183. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals on both sides (and flipping the inequality): n\u03c0 > 1/0.001 = 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 \u00f7 3.1416 \u2248 318.309.

Each n corresponds to a unique x-intercept, right? So, each integer n from 319 to 3183 gives a distinct x in the interval. So, yes, the count is 2865. I think that makes sense.

Calculating that, \u03c0 is approximately 3.14159265, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 3183.09886. Since n has to be an integer, n must be less than or equal to 3183. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals again: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is n\u03c0 > 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about how many times the function oscillates between 0.0001 and 0.001. As x approaches zero from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is from x = 0.0001 to x = 0.001, I can find the corresponding \u03b8 values by plugging x into \u03b8 = 1/x. So, when x = 0.001, \u03b8 = 1/0.001 = 1000. When x = 0.0001, \u03b8 = 1/0.0001 = 10000. So, \u03b8 ranges from 1000 to 10000. Now, sin(\u03b8) = 0 at \u03b8 = n\u03c0, so the number of zeros between \u03b8 = 1000 and \u03b8 = 10000 is the number of integers n such that 1000 \u2264 n\u03c0 \u2264 10000. Dividing each part by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 \u2264 n \u2264 10000/\u03c0. As before, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n starts at 319. 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n ends at 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, does each n correspond to exactly one x-intercept? Let me think. For each n, x = 1/(n\u03c0) is a unique point in the interval, right? So, yes, each n gives exactly one x-intercept. So, the total number should be 2865. However, I should check if 1/(319\u03c0) is greater than 0.001 and 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001. Let me compute 1/(319\u03c0). 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.14159265 \u2248 1003. So, 1/1003 \u2248 0.000997, which is approximately 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000997 is within (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so does x = 0.0001 count? No, because it's excluded. So, we need to check if 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Wait, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since it's exactly 0.0001 when n=3183, but our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001. So, does n=3183 give x=1/(3183\u03c0) which is approximately 0.0001, but since the interval is open, x=0.0001 is not included. Therefore, maybe n should go up to 3182? Wait, let me see. Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0). Since 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), x must be greater than 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n\u03c0 < 10000, so n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886. So, n must be less than 3183.09886, so the maximum integer n is 3183. But wait, if n=3183, then x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded. So, maybe n should be up to 3182? Let me check. Let me compute 1/(3182\u03c0). 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.14159265 \u2248 let's see, 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 182\u03c0 \u2248 572.04, so total \u2248 9424.77796 + 572.04 \u2248 10,000. So, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 10,000 - \u03c0 \u2248 9996.862. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.862 \u2248 0.000100032, which is slightly greater than 0.0001. So, x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100032 is just above 0.0001, so it is included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n can be 319 up to 3183, but n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. Wait, but earlier I thought n goes up to 3183. Let me clarify this. The inequality is 0.0001 < x < 0.001. So, substituting x=1/(n\u03c0), we get 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let's solve for n:\n\nFrom 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0), we get n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886.\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, we get n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 318.309886 < n < 3183.09886.\n\nSince n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183.\n\nBut wait, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but the interval is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001. Therefore, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is equal to 0.0001 approximately, but since the interval is open, it's excluded. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.09886, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, n should go up to 3182.\n\nWait, but earlier when I calculated n=3182, x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100032, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. So, n=3182 is included, but n=3183 is excluded because x would be 0.0001, which is excluded.\n\nTherefore, the number of n's is from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864.\n\nWait, so earlier I had 2865, but now I'm getting 2864. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me think again.\n\nWe have n starting at 319 and ending at 3182.\n\nNumber of terms is 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\nCompute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, 2882 - 19 = 2863.\n\nThen 2863 +1 = 2864.\n\nSo, the correct number is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier when I considered n from 319 to 3183, which would give 2865, but since n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, we need to subtract 1, giving 2864.\n\nSo, the correct number is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with specific numbers.\n\nSuppose n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.000997, which is within (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nn=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.000100032, which is just above 0.0001, so included.\n\nn=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000099968, which is just below 0.0001, so excluded.\n\nTherefore, n goes from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, which is correct? Let me think about how the number of integers between a and b inclusive is b - a +1. So, if a=319, b=3182, then 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the number is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another approach.\n\nThe interval for \u03b8 is from \u03b8=1000 to \u03b8=10000.\n\nThe zeros occur at \u03b8=n\u03c0, so n must satisfy 1000 \u2264 n\u03c0 \u226410000.\n\nSo, n must be \u2265 ceil(1000/\u03c0)=ceil(318.309886)=319.\n\nn must be \u2264 floor(10000/\u03c0)=floor(3183.09886)=3183.\n\nBut since \u03b8=10000 is excluded because x=0.0001 is excluded, we have \u03b8 <10000.\n\nSo, n\u03c0 <10000, so n <10000/\u03c0\u22483183.09886, so n\u22643183.\n\nBut when n=3183, \u03b8=3183\u03c0\u224810000. So, \u03b8=3183\u03c0\u224810000, which corresponds to x=1/\u03b8\u22480.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, n must be \u22643182.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nNumber of terms: 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nYes, so the correct number is 2864.\n\nI think earlier I made a mistake by including n=3183, but since x=1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded, we have to stop at n=3182.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at 1/x = n\u03c0 for integers n.

The number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}."

Let me calculate these values numerically. First, \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 10000/\u03c0 is about 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. Similarly, 1000/\u03c0 is about 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618 and less than approximately 3183.0988618. But n has to be an integer because it's the multiple of \u03c0 in the sine function. So, n must be integers from the next integer greater than 318.30988618, which is 319, up to the integer less than 3183.0988618, which is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, we can subtract 319 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me calculate that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 3183.098, and 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. Similarly, n must be less than 3183.098, so the largest integer n is 3183. Then, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Hmm, that seems correct.

Let me compute that: 10,000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 10,000 / 3.14159 \u2248 3183.09886. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.09886. Since n is an integer, n \u2264 3183. Now, let's look at the right inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001. 1/0.001 is 1000. So, n\u03c0 > 1000. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, we get n > 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.3098861. Since n is an integer, n \u2265 319. So, putting both inequalities together, n must satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. To find the number of integers from a to b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, then adding 1 gives 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 integer values of n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Thus, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in that interval. Wait, let me just double-check my calculations. So, 10,000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886, so n must be less than that, so the maximum integer n is 3183. Similarly, 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.3098861, so the minimum integer n is 319. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865. Yeah, that seems correct.

Now, I can divide all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184.

Wait, let me check that: The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Let me go through each step again. So, starting with x in (0.0001, 0.001), so x = 1/(n\u03c0), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.

Each n gives a unique x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, each integer n from 319 up to 3183 gives a valid x-intercept in that interval. Therefore, the total number is 2865.

Since n has to be an integer, n starts from the next integer after 318.309886184, which is 319, and goes up to the integer just below 3183.09886184, which is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183, inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1. Wait, let me think. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check that. Because sometimes when dealing with inequalities, it's easy to make a mistake with the endpoints. Let me verify the endpoints again. The original interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is an open interval, meaning it doesn't include the endpoints. So, we need to ensure that x = 1/(n\u03c0) is strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. So, when n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.8) \u2248 0.000996, which is approximately 0.000996, which is greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. Similarly, when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, but since it's an open interval, x must be greater than 0.0001. Wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, right? Because 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) \u2248 0.0001, but actually, since 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10000.0, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but just slightly less, because 3183\u03c0 is a bit more than 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) is just under 0.0001. Therefore, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's not included in the interval. Therefore, the maximum n for which x = 1/(n\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001 is when 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, so n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, the maximum integer n is 3183, but wait, when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n = 3183 - 1 = 3182. Wait, let me check that. Let me compute 1/(3182\u03c0). 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's see, 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 182\u03c0 \u2248 571.754, so total is approximately 9424.77796 + 571.754 \u2248 9996.532. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.532 \u2248 0.000100035, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n can be 3182, because x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100035, which is greater than 0.0001. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3182, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, there are 2864 integer values of n, which correspond to 2864 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, I need to reconcile this. Let me recast the problem. The condition is 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. And 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184. So, n must satisfy 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. But wait, when n = 3183, 1/(n\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182, inclusive. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. So, the correct number is 2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Let's compute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 -19 = 2863. Then add 1: 2863 +1 = 2864. So, yes, 2864. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the number of integers between 319 and 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating, n ranges from 319 to 3182, giving 2864 integer values.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}."

Taking reciprocals on both sides (and remembering that this will reverse the inequality because both sides are positive), we get: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0, which is 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, we get n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating that, \u03c0 is approximately 3.1416, so 10000/3.1416 \u2248 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n < 3183.098, so the maximum integer n can be is 3183. Now, let's look at the right inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is n\u03c0 > 1000. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that, 1000/3.1416 \u2248 318.309.

Taking reciprocals on both sides (and remembering that flipping inequalities when reciprocating because both sides are positive), we get: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0, which is 10000 > n\u03c0. Similarly, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals again, we get: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is n\u03c0 > 1000. So now, we have two inequalities: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. To find n, I can divide all parts by \u03c0. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me calculate these values. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 1000 / 3.1415926535. Let me compute that: 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 / \u03c0 is 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n starts from the next integer after 318.309886184, which is 319, and goes up to the integer before 3183.09886184, which is 3183. Now, to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, actually, let me think. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. But here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait a second, let me verify this because sometimes when dealing with inequalities, especially with reciprocals and intervals, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me check the endpoints again. When n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.55) \u2248 0.00099746, which is just below 0.001. Hmm, wait, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.55) \u2248 0.000997, which is indeed less than 0.001. But wait, 0.000997 is approximately 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Similarly, when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) = 0.0001, but wait, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 10000.0, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but since the interval is open, x cannot be exactly 0.0001. Therefore, n cannot be 3183 because that would give x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is not included in the interval. Wait, but earlier when I calculated 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so n must be less than that, meaning n can be up to 3183, but 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, which is the lower bound of the interval, but since the interval is open, we need x > 0.0001. So, n must satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which is n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n can be up to 3183, but when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is not included. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but we have to check if 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Wait, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but exactly, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let me compute that more accurately. Let me compute 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let's see, 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, and 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 574.70029, so adding them together, 9424.77796 + 574.70029 \u2248 9999.47825. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.47825, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.47825 \u2248 0.0001000052, which is just slightly above 0.0001. So, 0.0001000052 is greater than 0.0001, so x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is just above 0.0001, so it is included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n can be 319 up to 3183, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 x-intercepts. Wait, but let me check with n=319. 319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute that. 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477796, 19\u03c0 \u2248 59.6902604, so total \u2248 942.477796 + 59.6902604 \u2248 1002.168056. So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.168056 \u2248 0.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Similarly, n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001000052, which is just above 0.0001, so included. Therefore, the count is from n=319 to n=3183, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me think again. The function sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. As x approaches 0 from the positive side, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates increasingly rapidly. So, between any two points near zero, there are infinitely many oscillations. However, in our case, the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is a finite interval, albeit very close to zero. So, in this interval, each x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0), and we've found that n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, giving 2865 intercepts. That seems correct. So, I think the answer is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, leading to x = 1/(n\u03c0). Within the interval (0.0001, 0.001), n ranges from 319 to 3183, resulting in 2865 intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. If n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 minus 300 is 2883, minus 19 more is 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, that seems right. Therefore, there are 2865 integer values of n that satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183, each corresponding to an x-intercept in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial substitution. So, x = 1/(n\u03c0), and we have 0.0001 < x < 0.001. So, substituting x, we get 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which is the same as 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0). Wait, hold on, actually, when I take reciprocals, the inequalities reverse. Because if a < b, then 1/a > 1/b when a and b are positive. So, let me correct that. Starting with 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals, we have 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Then, dividing all parts by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 and less than 10000/\u03c0. Calculating those: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must satisfy 318.30988618 < n < 3183.0988618. Since n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. As before, 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me think again. Each n corresponds to a unique x in (0.0001, 0.001), right? So, each integer n from 319 to 3183 inclusive gives a distinct x-intercept. So, yeah, 2865 intercepts. Hmm, but let me make sure that these x-values are indeed within the interval. So, for n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.75) \u2248 0.000997, which is just above 0.0001, so that's within the interval. For n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, but wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly more than 0.0001 because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000, 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001. Wait, that's a problem. Because x must be greater than 0.0001, so if n = 3183 gives x \u2248 0.0001, but it's slightly less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. Therefore, n must be less than or equal to 3182. Wait, let me check that. Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0). Since \u03c0 \u2248 3.14159265, so 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265. Let me compute that: 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.14159265 \u2248 3183 * 0.1416 \u2248 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.0416 \u2248 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, 3183 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0928. Adding those: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.0928 \u2248 450.7128. So, total is 9549 + 450.7128 \u2248 9999.7128. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.7128, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.7128 \u2248 0.0001000028. Wait, that's approximately 0.0001000028, which is just a bit more than 0.0001. So, it's actually inside the interval. Because 0.0001 is 0.00010000, and 0.0001000028 is just barely above that. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000028, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Similarly, for n = 319, x \u2248 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.75 \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's included as well. Therefore, n can go from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 2865 x-intercepts. But wait, let me check n = 3184. Let's compute x = 1/(3184\u03c0). 3184\u03c0 \u2248 3184 * 3.14159265 \u2248 let's see, 3184 * 3 = 9552, 3184 * 0.14159265 \u2248 3184 * 0.1416 \u2248 3184 * 0.1 = 318.4, 3184 * 0.0416 \u2248 3184 * 0.04 = 127.36, 3184 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0944. Adding those: 318.4 + 127.36 = 445.76 + 5.0944 \u2248 450.8544. So, total is 9552 + 450.8544 \u2248 9999.8544. So, 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.8544 \u2248 0.0001000015, which is still above 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000015, which is still in the interval. Wait, but earlier I thought n goes up to 3183, but now n=3184 also gives x \u22480.0001000015, which is still in (0.0001, 0.001). So, perhaps I made a mistake in the upper limit. Let me re-examine the inequality.\n\nStarting from x = 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618, so n \u2265 319.\n\nSimilarly, x = 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618, so n \u2264 3183.\n\nWait, but when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001000028, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. But when n=3184, x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0001000015, which is also greater than 0.0001, so it's included as well. Wait, that can't be right because 1/(n\u03c0) decreases as n increases. So, as n increases, x decreases. So, when n increases, x becomes smaller. So, if n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001000028, which is just above 0.0001, then n=3184 would give x\u22480.0001000015, which is also just above 0.0001, but n=3185 would give x\u22480.0001000006, and so on, until n=10000, which would give x=1/(10000\u03c0)\u22480.00003183, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n goes up to 3183. But according to this, n can go higher as long as x remains above 0.0001. So, perhaps I need to find the maximum n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001.\n\nSo, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618, so the maximum integer n is 3183.\n\nWait, but when n=3183, x\u22480.0001000028>0.0001, which is included. When n=3184, x\u22480.0001000015>0.0001, which is still included. Wait, but 3184 is greater than 3183.0988618? No, 3183.0988618 is approximately 3183.0988618, so 3184 is greater than that, so n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0001000015, which is still greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Wait, but that would mean that n can go up to 3183, but 3184 is also allowed. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me compute 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001.\n\nSo, n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988618.\n\nSo, n must be less than 3183.0988618, so the maximum integer n is 3183.\n\nBut when n=3184, 1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0001000015>0.0001, which is still true. So, that's a problem because 3184 < 3183.0988618? No, 3184 is greater than 3183.0988618, so n=3184 would actually give x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0001000015, which is still greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Wait, but according to the inequality, n must be less than 3183.0988618, so n=3183 is allowed, but n=3184 is not, because 3184 > 3183.0988618. Wait, but 3184 is greater than 3183.0988618, so 3184 > 3183.0988618, so n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0001000015>0.0001, which is still included. So, perhaps my initial inequality was incorrect. Let me think again.\n\nIf x = 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, then n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988618.\n\nSo, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618, so the maximum integer n is 3183.\n\nBut when n=3184, which is greater than 3183.0988618, then x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0001000015, which is still greater than 0.0001, which seems contradictory.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me compute 1/(3184\u03c0) precisely.\n\nCompute 3184 * \u03c0:\n\n\u03c0 \u2248 3.141592653589793.\n\n3184 * 3 = 9552.\n\n3184 * 0.141592653589793 \u2248 Let's compute 3184 * 0.1 = 318.4\n\n3184 * 0.041592653589793 \u2248 3184 * 0.04 = 127.36\n\n3184 * 0.001592653589793 \u2248 3184 * 0.001 = 3.184\n\nSo, adding up: 318.4 + 127.36 = 445.76 + 3.184 \u2248 448.944.\n\nSo, total 3184\u03c0 \u2248 9552 + 448.944 \u2248 9999.944.\n\nThus, 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.944 \u2248 0.00010000055.\n\nSo, 0.00010000055 is just slightly above 0.0001, so x=1/(3184\u03c0) is still in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3184 is allowed. But according to the inequality, n must be less than 3183.0988618, which is approximately 3183.0988618, so 3184 is greater than that, which would imply that x=1/(3184\u03c0) < 0.0001, but that's not the case. Therefore, my initial inequality might have been incorrect.\n\nWait, let me re-express the inequality correctly.\n\nWe have x = 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001.\n\nSo, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001.\n\nMultiplying both sides by n\u03c0 (positive, so inequality remains the same):\n\n1 > 0.0001 * n\u03c0.\n\nDividing both sides by 0.0001\u03c0:\n\n1 / (0.0001\u03c0) > n.\n\nSo, n < 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988618.\n\nSo, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618, so the maximum integer n is 3183.\n\nBut when n=3184, as we saw, x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.00010000055>0.0001, which is still included. So, that's a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the inequality is not correctly capturing the upper bound.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that n must satisfy both x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 and x=1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nWait, no, the original interval is 0.0001 < x < 0.001, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001.\n\nSo, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nSo, taking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities):\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001.\n\nSo, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nDividing by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nSo, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618,\n\n10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618.\n\nTherefore, n must be an integer satisfying 318.30988618 < n < 3183.0988618.\n\nSo, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, because 3183 is less than 3183.0988618, and 319 is greater than 318.30988618.\n\nThus, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nBut wait, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001000028, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. When n=3184, x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.00010000055, which is still above 0.0001, but according to the inequality, n must be less than 3183.0988618, so n=3184 is excluded. Wait, but 3184 is greater than 3183.0988618, so n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.00010000055, which is still above 0.0001, but according to the inequality, n must be less than 3183.0988618, so n=3184 is not allowed. Therefore, the maximum n is 3183.\n\nTherefore, the number of integer n's is from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier when I calculated n=3184, it still gave x=0.00010000055, which is still in the interval. So, perhaps the inequality is not precise because 3183.0988618 is very close to 3183.1, so n=3183 is allowed, but n=3184 is not, because 3184 > 3183.0988618.\n\nWait, let me compute 3183.0988618 exactly. So, 10000/\u03c0 = 10000 / 3.141592653589793 \u2248 3183.0988618.\n\nSo, 3183.0988618 is approximately 3183.0988618.\n\nSo, n must be less than 3183.0988618, so the maximum integer n is 3183.\n\nTherefore, n=3183 is allowed, but n=3184 is not, because 3184 > 3183.0988618.\n\nTherefore, the number of n's is from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with n=3183:\n\nx=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001000028>0.0001, so included.\n\nn=3184: x\u22480.00010000055>0.0001, but n=3184 is not allowed because it's greater than 3183.0988618.\n\nWait, but 3184 is greater than 3183.0988618, so n=3184 is excluded, which means the maximum n is 3183.\n\nTherefore, the total number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that n=3184 gives x\u22480.00010000055, which is still in the interval, but according to the inequality, n must be less than 3183.0988618, so n=3184 is excluded. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check with n=3183:\n\nx=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001000028>0.0001, included.\n\nn=3184: x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.00010000055>0.0001, but n=3184 is excluded because it's greater than 3183.0988618.\n\nWait, but 3183.0988618 is approximately 3183.0988618, so 3184 is indeed greater than that, so n=3184 is excluded.\n\nTherefore, the number of n's is from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe number of x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is determined by finding the integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies within the interval. This results in 2865 integer values of n, leading to 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{2865}."

    "text": " Let's take the first inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Taking reciprocals on both sides (and remembering that flipping inequalities when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive), we get: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0 \u21d2 10000 > n\u03c0 \u21d2 n < 10000/\u03c0. Similarly, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals again: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001 \u21d2 n\u03c0 > 1000 \u21d2 n > 1000/\u03c0. So, combining both inequalities, n must satisfy: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Now, let's compute these values numerically. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. Now, n has to be an integer, so n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. So, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, we can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1. Wait, no, actually, since 319 is the starting point, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so the next integer is 319. Similarly, 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so the largest integer n is 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and 2864 + 1 is 2865. That seems correct. Hmm, but wait, let me check if 3183 is indeed less than 10000/\u03c0. Since 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let me compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, and 183\u03c0 \u2248 574.78596. Adding those together, 9424.77796 + 574.78596 \u2248 9999.56392, which is just under 10000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.56392 < 10000, so 3183 is indeed less than 10000/\u03c0. So, 3183 is the correct upper bound. Similarly, 319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477796, and 19\u03c0 \u2248 59.69026042. Adding them gives 942.477796 + 59.69026042 \u2248 1002.168056, which is greater than 1000, so 319\u03c0 \u2248 1002.168056 > 1000, which means that 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.168056 \u2248 0.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so 319 is within the interval. Wait, but 0.0009978 is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Wait, but 0.0001 is 1e-4, and 0.001 is 1e-3, so 0.0009978 is indeed between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, 319 is valid. Let me check n=318: 318\u03c0 \u2248 318 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477796, 18\u03c0 \u2248 56.54866776. Adding gives 942.477796 + 56.54866776 \u2248 999.0264638. So, 318\u03c0 \u2248 999.0264638, which is less than 1000, so 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/999.0264638 \u2248 0.001001005, which is greater than 0.001, so 318 is not within the interval. Therefore, n must start at 319. So, my calculation seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but I just thought of something. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches zero. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is very close to zero, the function oscillates rapidly. Each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, we get another zero crossing. So, the number of zeros should correspond to how many times 1/x crosses multiples of \u03c0 in that interval. So, when x is in (0.0001, 0.001), 1/x is in (1000, 10000). So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. So, the number of zeros is the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. So, the smallest integer multiple of \u03c0 greater than or equal to 1000 is the first zero, and the largest integer multiple of \u03c0 less than or equal to 10000 is the last zero. The number of such multiples is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0) + 1. Which is exactly what I did earlier, leading to 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, I think the answer is 2865. But let me just check if I'm not missing anything. For example, sometimes when dealing with inequalities, off-by-one errors can occur. Let me confirm the exact values. Compute 1000/\u03c0: as I did before, approximately 318.309886184, so ceil(1000/\u03c0) = 319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so floor(10000/\u03c0) = 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2865. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. I just realized that in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), x is approaching zero from the positive side, so 1/x is going from 1000 to 10000. Each time 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0, we get a zero. So, the number of zeros is equal to the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000, which is indeed floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0) + 1. So, that's 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. The function sin(1/x) has a period of 2\u03c0/(1/x) = 2\u03c0x. Wait, no, that's not quite right. The period of sin(1/x) isn't straightforward because as x changes, the argument 1/x changes non-linearly. Instead, the zeros occur at 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, between x = 0.0001 and x = 0.001, which is from x = 1e-4 to x = 1e-3, 1/x goes from 1e4 to 1e3. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 0.0001 is 1e-4, so 1/x is 1e4, and 0.001 is 1e-3, so 1/x is 1e3. Wait, so 1/x decreases from 1e4 to 1e3 as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001. So, 1/x goes from 10000 down to 1000. So, the number of zeros is the number of times 1/x crosses multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. So, the number of zeros is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0) + 1, which is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the function doesn't have any extra zeros beyond these points. For example, does sin(1/x) cross zero exactly once between each 1/x = n\u03c0 and 1/x = (n+1)\u03c0? I think so because the sine function crosses zero once between each multiple of \u03c0, so each interval (n\u03c0, (n+1)\u03c0) contains exactly one zero crossing. Therefore, each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept. So, the count is correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider the behavior of sin(1/x). As x approaches zero from the positive side, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. But in our interval, we're only looking from x = 0.0001 to x = 0.001, so 1/x from 1000 to 10000. So, the number of oscillations is finite, specifically, the number of zeros is 2865, as calculated.\n\nWait, but let me check for n=319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.168 \u2248 0.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Similarly, for n=3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.564 \u2248 0.000100004, which is just above 0.0001, so it's within the interval. So, both endpoints are included, so the count is correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3183 - 319 + 1 again. 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that's correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked all the steps, and everything seems consistent. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

    "text": " Let's start with the left inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Taking reciprocals on both sides (and remembering that reversing the inequality when taking reciprocals), we get: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0, which is 10000 > n\u03c0. Similarly, for the right inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals again, we get: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is n\u03c0 > 1000. So now, combining both inequalities: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute those values. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n must be greater than approximately 318.309 and less than approximately 3183.098. Therefore, n can take integer values starting from the next integer after 318.309, which is 319, up to the integer just below 3183.098, which is 3183. Now, to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is given by b - a + 1. So, plugging in the numbers: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that. 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Each of these n corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, starting with x = 1/(n\u03c0), and the interval 0.0001 < x < 0.001. That translates to 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n, as I did, gives n < 10000/\u03c0 and n > 1000/\u03c0. So, n is between approximately 318.309 and 3183.098. So, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest is 3183. So, the count is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more gives 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, let me check with n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.00) \u2248 0.000997, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's within the interval. Similarly, n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.00) = 0.0001, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, does 1/(3183\u03c0) equal exactly 0.0001? Wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but let me check: 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 10000.0000000003, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999999997, which is just slightly less than 0.0001. But our interval is x > 0.0001, so x must be greater than 0.0001, so n=3183 gives x \u2248 0.00009999999997, which is less than 0.0001. Therefore, n=3183 would actually give x just below 0.0001, which is outside our interval. So, perhaps the largest n is 3182? Let me check: 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 3180 * \u03c0 \u2248 3180 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3180 * 3 = 9540, 3180 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3180 * 0.1416 \u2248 450.048, so total \u2248 9540 + 450.048 \u2248 9990.048. Then, 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 9990.048 + 2\u03c0 \u2248 9990.048 + 6.283 \u2248 9996.331. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.331 \u2248 0.000100037, which is just above 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100037, which is within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n=3182 gives x \u2248 0.000100037, which is in the interval. Therefore, n can go up to 3182. So, my previous calculation was incorrect because I included n=3183, which actually gives x just below 0.0001, outside the interval. So, the maximum n is 3182. Therefore, the count is from n=319 to n=3182. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then adding 1 gives 2864. So, the correct number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, so I made a mistake earlier by including n=3183, which is actually outside the interval. Therefore, the correct count is 2864. Let me verify this again. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n starts at 319. And n must be less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n can go up to 3183. But wait, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00009999999997, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, which gives x\u22480.000100037, which is included. So, the number of n's is from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Therefore, the final answer is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n gives 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so 318.309 < n < 3183.098. The integers n range from 319 to 3182, inclusive. The count is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\n$\\boxed{2864}$"

Similarly, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals gives n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, putting it together: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.

So, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319, and the largest possible n is 3183. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, actually, let me make sure. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, in this case, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31, so n starts at 319. 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n ends at 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2865. Yep, that seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's the answer. Just to make sure, let me consider the behavior of sin(1/x). As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. In the interval from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is a relatively small interval near zero, the function will oscillate a large number of times, hence many x-intercepts. The calculation above gives 2865 intercepts, which seems plausible because the interval is quite close to zero, leading to a high frequency of oscillations. So, I think I can confidently say that the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, leading to x = 1/(n\u03c0). For x in (0.0001, 0.001), we find n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Solving for n gives 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

    "text": " Let's take the first inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that reversing the inequality because both sides are positive, I get: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Calculating 1/0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute 10000 divided by \u03c0. Since \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n is an integer, the maximum possible n is 3183.\n\nNow, let's take the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, 1/0.001 > n\u03c0. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, if 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, then taking reciprocals on both sides (since both sides are positive) would reverse the inequality: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n\u03c0 > 1000, meaning n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that, 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618. Since n is an integer, the smallest possible n is 319.\n\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I did that correctly. So, starting with 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, taking reciprocals: n\u03c0 > 1000, so n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be at least 319.\n\nSimilarly, from the first inequality, n < 3183.0988618, so n can be up to 3183.\n\nTherefore, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183. Now, to find how many integers are in this range, we can compute 3183 - 319 + 1. Wait, because when counting inclusive, it's the difference plus one. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that subtraction: 3183 - 319. Let's compute 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Hmm, but wait a second. Let me make sure that all these x values are indeed within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Because sometimes when dealing with reciprocals, especially with functions like 1/x, the endpoints can be tricky. Let me verify for n=319 and n=3183.\n\nFor n=319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(319*3.1415926535). Let me compute 319*3.1415926535. 300*3.1415926535 is 942.47779605, and 19*3.1415926535 is approximately 59.6902604165. Adding them together: 942.47779605 + 59.6902604165 \u2248 1002.16805647. So, x \u2248 1/1002.16805647 \u2248 0.00099783, which is approximately 0.00099783, which is greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, that's good.\n\nFor n=3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183*3.1415926535). Let me compute 3183*3.1415926535. 3000*3.1415926535 is 9424.7779605, and 183*3.1415926535. Let's compute 180*3.1415926535 = 565.48667763, and 3*3.1415926535 \u2248 9.4247779605. So, adding those: 565.48667763 + 9.4247779605 \u2248 574.91145559. So total is 9424.7779605 + 574.91145559 \u2248 9999.68941609. So, x \u2248 1/9999.68941609 \u2248 0.000100003, which is just slightly above 0.0001, so it's within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, that's good too.\n\nWait, but let me check n=3183: 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.689, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. Similarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.00099783, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, both endpoints are included, so our count from n=319 to n=3183 inclusive is correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that there isn't an off-by-one error here. Sometimes when counting inclusive ranges, it's easy to make a mistake. So, let's consider that the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, if a=319 and b=3183, then it's 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive is equal to the number of integers less than or equal to 3183 minus the number of integers less than 319. Since the number of integers less than or equal to N is N, and the number of integers less than 319 is 318, so 3183 - 318 = 2865. Wait, that's another way to see it. So, that also gives 2865.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me just think again: when x is in (0.0001, 0.001), 1/x is in (1000, 10000). So, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so 1/x must be between 1000 and 10000. Therefore, n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000 \u2264 n\u03c0 \u2264 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 \u2264 n \u2264 10000/\u03c0. Which is approximately 318.30988618 \u2264 n \u2264 3183.0988618. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That's consistent with what I found earlier.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let's check n=318: n=318, then x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.000... something). Let me compute 318*\u03c0 \u2248 318*3.1415926535 \u2248 1000.000... Wait, 318*3.1415926535 is exactly 1000.000...? Wait, no, let me compute that more accurately. 318*3.1415926535: 300*3.1415926535=942.47779605, 18*3.1415926535\u224856.548667762. Adding them together: 942.47779605 + 56.548667762 \u2248 999.02646381. So, 318\u03c0\u2248999.02646381, which is less than 1000. Therefore, n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22481/999.02646381\u22480.001001001, which is just above 0.001, so it's outside the upper bound of the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=318 is excluded, which is why we start at n=319, which gives x\u22480.00099783, which is less than 0.001. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, n=3183: 3183\u03c0\u22489999.689, which is just below 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000100003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. If we took n=3184, then 3184\u03c0\u22483184*3.1415926535\u2248 let's see, 3000\u03c0\u22489424.77796, 184\u03c0\u2248577.52264, so total\u22489424.77796 + 577.52264\u224810002.3006. So, 1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.000099977, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the lower bound. Therefore, n=3184 is excluded, so n goes up to 3183.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n, we find n ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 intercepts.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

If I take reciprocals on both sides (remembering to flip the inequality sign because I'm dealing with positive numbers), I get: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0, which is 10000 > n\u03c0. So, n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me calculate that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n < approximately 3183.0988618. Since n has to be an integer, n \u2264 3183. Now, let's look at the right inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is n\u03c0 > 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. Since n has to be an integer, n \u2265 319 (since 318.309... is just above 318, so the next integer is 319). So, putting it together, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers in this range, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Wait, let me check that subtraction again: 3183 minus 319. Let's do it step by step. 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. So, 2864 + 1 = 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 integer values of n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me confirm the calculations. So, 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618, so n must be less than that, so the maximum integer n is 3183. Then, 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, so n must be greater than that, so the minimum integer n is 319. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Hmm, that seems like a lot, but considering the function oscillates rapidly as x approaches zero, it makes sense that there are many intercepts in that interval. Let me just visualize the function y = sin(1/x). As x approaches zero from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so the sine function oscillates more and more rapidly. So, between 0.0001 and 0.001, which are both very close to zero, the function will oscillate many times, leading to many x-intercepts. So, 2865 seems plausible. I don't think I made any calculation errors, but let me just double-check the math. 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, so n must be at least 319. 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618, so n must be at most 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Yes, that's correct.

If I take reciprocals on both sides (and reverse the inequality because reciprocating positive numbers reverses the inequality), I get: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0, which is 10000 > n\u03c0. Similarly, for the right inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals again, we get: n\u03c0 > 1000. So now I have: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. To find n, I can divide all parts by \u03c0. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me calculate these values. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184.

First, 10000 divided by \u03c0. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618.

Again, taking reciprocals, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001. 1/0.001 is 1000, so n\u03c0 > 1000. Thus, n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 / 3.14159265 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618. Since n is an integer, n must be at least 319. So, putting it together, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. To find the number of integers from a to b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, substituting, we get 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n in this range, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 1/0.0001 is indeed 10000, and 1/0.001 is 1000. Then, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988, so n must be less than that, so the maximum integer n is 3183. Similarly, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098, so the minimum integer n is 319. Then, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. So, I think 2865 is the correct number of x-intercepts. I don't think I made a mistake here, but just to be thorough, let me consider whether all these x-values indeed lie within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). The smallest x is when n is largest, so x = 1/(3183\u03c0). Let's compute that: 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound. Similarly, the largest x is when n is smallest, so x = 1/(319\u03c0). Let's compute that: 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.14159265 \u2248 1003. So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000997, which is just a bit less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, yes, all these x-values are indeed within (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n.

Dividing both sides by \u03c0: n < 10000/\u03c0. Similarly, the right inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals again: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is n\u03c0 > 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Now, let's compute these values numerically to find the range of integers n. First, 10000 divided by \u03c0. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.098861. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.098861. Since n has to be an integer, the maximum integer n can be is 3183. Now, for the lower bound: 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.3098861. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.3098861. Therefore, the smallest integer n can be is 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is given by b - a + 1. So, plugging in the numbers: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, and then +1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n in this range, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's confirm the calculations. 10000 / \u03c0 is indeed about 3183.098861, so the largest integer n is 3183. 1000 / \u03c0 is about 318.3098861, so the smallest integer n is 319. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the function y = sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely as x approaches 0, but in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a very small interval near zero, the number of oscillations is finite, and we've calculated it to be 2865. That makes sense because as x gets smaller, 1/x gets larger, and sin(1/x) oscillates more rapidly. So, in the interval from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is a span of 0.0009, the function will cross the x-axis 2865 times. Hmm, that seems like a lot, but considering the interval is very close to zero, it's plausible. I think I did everything correctly, but let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let me check the reciprocals again. Starting with 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 10000 > n\u03c0 > 1000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 and less than 10000/\u03c0. Which is what I did earlier, so that part is correct.

So, putting it together, n must satisfy: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Now, let me compute these values numerically. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, let's compute 1000/\u03c0: 1000 divided by 3.1415926535 is approximately 318.30988618. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 is 10000 divided by 3.1415926535, which is approximately 3183.0988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618 and less than approximately 3183.0988618. But n has to be an integer because it's the multiple of \u03c0 in the sine function. So, the smallest integer n can be is the next integer after 318.30988618, which is 319. The largest integer n can be is the integer part of 3183.0988618, which is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, actually, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and then adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check that calculation because it's easy to make a mistake with the numbers. Let me compute 3183 - 319 again. 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then minus 19 more is 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's the answer. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. So, x = 1/(n\u03c0) must lie between 0.0001 and 0.001.

Which simplifies to 10000 > n\u03c0. So, n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating that, \u03c0 is approximately 3.1416, so 10000 / 3.1416 \u2248 3183.098.

So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that, 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.309. Since n must be an integer, n must be greater than or equal to 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then adding 1 gives 2865. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 3183 - 319 is actually 2864, right? So, 2864 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check. If n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then minus 19 is 2864. So, 2864 + 1 is 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n, which correspond to 2865 x-intercepts in the given interval. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the range. So, x has to be greater than 0.0001, which is 10^{-4}, and less than 0.001, which is 10^{-3}. So, 10^{-4} < x < 10^{-3}, which translates to 1/(n\u03c0) between 10^{-4} and 10^{-3}. So, n must satisfy 10^{3} < n\u03c0 < 10^{4}, which is the same as 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 and less than 10000/\u03c0. As calculated earlier, that's approximately 318.309 < n < 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me check if n=3183 is included. Since 3183\u03c0 is approximately 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound of the interval. Since the interval is open at 0.0001, does that mean x=1/(3183\u03c0) is excluded? Wait, the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, meaning x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, x=1/(n\u03c0) must satisfy 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) must be strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. Therefore, n must satisfy 1/(0.001) > n\u03c0 > 1/(0.0001), which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. Now, does n=3183 satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001? Let's see: 1/(3183 * \u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/10000 \u2248 0.0001. But since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so x=1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded. So, n=3183 would give x=0.0001, which is not included. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but wait, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound. Since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so n must be less than 3183.098, meaning n can be up to 3183, but wait, 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, which is not included. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. Wait, that's a mistake I made earlier. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but since x=1/(3183\u03c0) is excluded, n can only go up to 3182. So, let's recalculate the range. So, n must satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3182. Now, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 is 2864. So, there are 2864 integer values of n, meaning 2864 x-intercepts. Wait, but earlier I thought n went up to 3183, but since x=1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded, n must go up to 3182. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Let me confirm this. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact bounds. Let's solve for n in the inequalities 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n\u03c0 < 10000 \u21d2 n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. Since n must be an integer, n \u2264 3183. But since 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is not greater, so n must be \u2264 3182. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u21d2 n\u03c0 > 1000 \u21d2 n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098861. So, n \u2265 319. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. The number of integers from 319 to 3182 is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but now I'm getting 2864 because n=3183 is excluded. So, which one is correct? Let me check with specific numbers. Let's take n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1004.3) \u2248 0.0009957, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000 - \u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but slightly more than 0.0001, so it's included. n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 exactly, which is excluded. So, n goes from 319 to 3182, inclusive. So, the number of terms is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then minus 19 is 2863. Then, 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, the correct number of x-intercepts is 2864. Therefore, the answer is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001  \n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000  \n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098\n\nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive.

Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me think again. Is each n in that range corresponding to a unique x in the interval? Let me confirm. For each integer n from 319 to 3183, x = 1/(n\u03c0) will be in (0.0001, 0.001). Let's check for n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.14) \u2248 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001 and greater than 0.0001. For n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) \u2248 0.0001, but wait, our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but since the interval is open, does that mean x cannot be exactly 0.0001? Wait, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but actually, let me calculate it more precisely. Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0: 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, and 183\u03c0 \u2248 575.01482, so total is approximately 9424.77796 + 575.01482 \u2248 10,000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.0001, does that mean x = 0.0001 is excluded? So, x must be greater than 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886. So, n can be up to 3183, but does 1/(3183\u03c0) equal exactly 0.0001? Let me check: 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 10,000.000000000...? Wait, actually, 3183 is approximately 10000/\u03c0, but it's not exact. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but slightly less? Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0: 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let's compute 3000*\u03c0=9424.77796, 180*\u03c0=565.48667, 3*\u03c0=9.42477. Adding those together: 9424.77796 + 565.48667 = 9990.26463, plus 9.42477 = 9999.6894. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.6894, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.6894 \u2248 0.00010000314. So, it's slightly more than 0.0001. Therefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010000314, which is greater than 0.0001, so it is included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n can be 3183, and x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is inside the interval. Similarly, for n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009968, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive correspond to x in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 -19=2864, then add 1: 2865. Yes, that's correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, which gives x = 1/(n\u03c0).

    "text": " Let's take the first inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that taking reciprocals reverses the inequality (since both sides are positive), it becomes: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Calculating 1/0.0001, that's 10000. So, 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, I get n < 10000/\u03c0. Similarly, the second inequality is 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals again, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001. 1/0.001 is 1000, so n\u03c0 > 1000. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, n > 1000/\u03c0. Now, let me compute 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. But n has to be an integer because it's from the equation sin(1/x) = 0 at x = 1/(n\u03c0). Therefore, n must satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Now, let's check if n can actually reach 3183. Since n must be less than approximately 3183.09886184, the largest integer n can be is 3183. Similarly, the smallest integer n can be is 319. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, we can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, no, actually, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, 1000/\u03c0 is approximately 318.309886184, so the smallest integer n is 319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 is approximately 3183.09886184, so the largest integer n is 3183. Now, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more, so 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me consider the behavior of the function near the endpoints. As x approaches 0.0001 from the right, 1/x approaches 10000, so sin(1/x) oscillates rapidly between -1 and 1. Similarly, as x approaches 0.001 from the left, 1/x approaches 1000, so sin(1/x) oscillates less rapidly. The function crosses the x-axis every time 1/x increases by \u03c0, which corresponds to x decreasing by 1/(n\u03c0) each time. So, the number of zeros is indeed the number of n's we found, which is 2865. Yeah, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), which translates to 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Solving for n gives approximately 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. The number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive is 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

Taking reciprocals on both sides (and remembering that flipping the inequality when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive), we get: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0, which is 10000 > n\u03c0. Similarly, for the right inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, taking reciprocals gives n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is n\u03c0 > 1000. So now we have: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. To find n, we can divide all parts by \u03c0. Let me compute 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must satisfy 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n can take integer values from the next integer after 318.309886184, which is 319, up to the integer just below 3183.09886184, which is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Now, to find how many integers are in this range, we can subtract 318 from 3183 and then adjust. Wait, no, actually, it's from 319 to 3183. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, plugging in, we get 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then +1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n in that range, which would correspond to 2865 x-intercepts. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me check the calculations again. First, 1000/\u03c0 is approximately 318.31, so the next integer is 319. Then, 10000/\u03c0 is approximately 3183.098, so the integer part is 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more to get 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me think again: each n from 319 to 3183 gives a unique x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept. Therefore, the total number is 2865. Hmm, that seems like a lot, but given the interval is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is very close to zero, and the function sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times as x approaches zero, so in this interval, it's oscillating very rapidly, leading to many zeros. So, 2865 intercepts in that interval seems plausible. Let me just confirm the calculations once more to be sure. So, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31, so n starts at 319. 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n ends at 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Yep, that seems right.

Hmm, actually, when I take reciprocals, the inequalities should reverse. So, starting with 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0), taking reciprocals gives 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0, which is 10000 > n\u03c0, so n < 10000/\u03c0. Similarly, from 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, taking reciprocals gives 1/0.001 < n\u03c0, which is 1000 < n\u03c0, so n > 1000/\u03c0. Wait, that makes more sense. So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 and less than 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute those values. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 1000/3.1415926535 \u2248 318.3098861. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000/3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.098861. So, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.3098861 and less than approximately 3183.098861. Since n has to be an integer, n can take integer values from 319 up to 3183.

So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the given interval. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. Let me double-check. The interval for x is (0.0001, 0.001). So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), that means 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals, as I did before, gives 10000 > n\u03c0 > 1000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Which gives n > ~318.3098861 and n < ~3183.098861. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. So, the number of n's is 3183 - 318 = 2865.

Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n can take integer values from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, here, a = 319 and b = 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so the next integer is 319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so the last integer is 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that makes sense because as x approaches zero from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. Therefore, in the interval from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is a relatively small interval near zero, there are a large number of oscillations, leading to many x-intercepts. So, 2865 seems like a reasonable number.\n</think>\n\nThe function \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) has x-intercepts where \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\).

Taking reciprocals on both sides (and remembering that this will reverse the inequality because reciprocating positive numbers reverses the order), we get: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0, which is 10000 > n\u03c0. Similarly, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which when reciprocated becomes n\u03c0 > 1000. So now, we have: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. To find the range of n, we can divide all parts by \u03c0. Let me compute \u03c0 as approximately 3.1415926536. So, dividing each part by \u03c0: 1000 / \u03c0 < n < 10000 / \u03c0. Let me calculate these values. 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926536 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926536 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers, inclusive, we can subtract the smaller number from the larger one and add 1. So, number of integers = 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).

So, from 319 to 3183, inclusive, how many numbers? Let me compute 3183 - 319. 3183 minus 300 is 2883, minus 19 more is 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. Yeah, that seems correct.

Dividing both sides by \u03c0: 10000/\u03c0 > n. Similarly, for the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n\u03c0 > 1000.

First, 10000/\u03c0: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by that is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n < 3183.0988618.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. If I have n starting at 319 and ending at 3183, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. So, 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n in that range, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check. When n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.909) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so that's good. When n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.001) \u2248 0.000099999, which is just above 0.0001, so that's also good. So, each integer n from 319 to 3183 gives a valid x in the interval.

Dividing both sides by \u03c0: n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me calculate that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 3183.0988618.

Let me check: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 = 2864; 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that can't be right because 3183 - 319 is 2864, so adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, but let me think again. Wait, if n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 is 2865. So, that would suggest there are 2865 x-intercepts. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, sometimes it's easier to think of it as starting from n=1 up to n=3183, which would be 3183 terms, and then subtracting the number of terms from n=1 to n=318, which is 318 terms. So, 3183 - 318 = 2865. Yeah, that checks out. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me just confirm the inequalities again to make sure I didn't flip them. So, x must be greater than 0.0001, which is 1/10000, and less than 0.001, which is 1/1000. So, 1/10000 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 1/1000. Taking reciprocals, since all terms are positive, the inequalities reverse: 10000 > n\u03c0 > 1000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing all parts by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. As I calculated before, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886. So, n must be an integer greater than 318.309886 and less than 3183.09886. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but just to double-check, let me think about n=319: 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.1) \u2248 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001, so that's within the interval. And n=3183: 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) = 0.0001, which is exactly the lower bound, but since the interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), we need to check if x=0.0001 is included. But wait, x=0.0001 is 1/10000, so when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0). Let me calculate 3183*\u03c0: 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 let me compute 3000*3.1416=9424.8, 183*3.1416\u2248575.25, so total \u2248 9424.8 + 575.25 = 10,000.05. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000.05, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999995, which is just slightly less than 0.0001. So, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999995, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u22480.0000999995, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not in our interval. So, the maximum n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. Let's solve for n in 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. That gives n\u03c0 < 10000, so n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886. So, n must be less than that, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x\u22480.0000999995, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the maximum n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3183, but since x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, we need to find the next lower n where x=1/(n\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Wait, that seems contradictory. Let me think again. Wait, if n increases, x decreases because x=1/(n\u03c0). So, for x to be greater than 0.0001, n must be less than 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.09886. So, the maximum integer n is 3183, but x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0000999995, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the largest n for which x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3182. Let's check n=3182: 3182\u03c0\u22483182*3.14159265\u22483182*3.1416\u22483000*3.1416=9424.8, 182*3.1416\u2248572.35, so total\u22489424.8 + 572.35\u224810,000.05 - wait, no, 3182 is less than 3183, so 3182\u03c0\u22483182*3.14159265\u2248 let me compute more accurately. Alternatively, 3182\u03c0\u22483183\u03c0 - \u03c0\u224810000.05 - 3.14159265\u22489996.9084. So, 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22481/9996.9084\u22480.00010003, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n=3182 gives x\u22480.00010003, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. Similarly, n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22481/(1003.1)\u22480.0009968, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3182. Now, let's compute the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive. That's 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863. Then add 1: 2863 + 1 = 2864. Wait, so that's 2864 integers. But earlier, I thought it was 2865. Hmm, seems like I made a mistake earlier by including n=3183, which actually gives x less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the correct number is from n=319 to n=3182, which is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. Let me verify with another approach: the number of integers between a and b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3182 - 319 + 1 = 3182 - 319 = 2863; 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, 2864 x-intercepts. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating n=3182. Because when n=3182, x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.00010003, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included. And n=319 gives x\u22480.0009968, which is less than 0.001, so included. So, the total number is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. So, the answer should be 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865 because I included n=3183, but that's incorrect because n=3183 gives x less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the correct number is 2864. Let me just check with n=3182: 3182\u03c0\u22483182*3.14159265\u2248 let's compute 3182*3=9546, 3182*0.14159265\u22483182*0.1=318.2, 3182*0.04159265\u2248approx 3182*0.04=127.28, 3182*0.00159265\u2248approx 5.08. So total\u2248318.2 + 127.28 + 5.08\u2248450.56. So, total 3182\u03c0\u22489546 + 450.56\u224810,000.56. So, 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22481/10000.56\u22480.000099994, which is approximately 0.000099994, which is just under 0.0001. Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Wait, if 3182\u03c0\u224810,000.56, then 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.000099994, which is less than 0.0001, so x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.000099994, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, that means n=3182 also gives x less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Wait, so now I'm confused because earlier I thought n=3182 gives x\u22480.00010003, but now with more precise calculation, it's giving x\u22480.000099994, which is less than 0.0001. Hmm, perhaps my initial approximation was off. Let me compute 3182\u03c0 more accurately. Let's compute 3182 * \u03c0: \u03c0\u22483.141592653589793. So, 3182 * 3 = 9546. 3182 * 0.141592653589793: Let's compute 3182 * 0.1 = 318.2, 3182 * 0.041592653589793 \u2248 let's compute 3182 * 0.04 = 127.28, 3182 * 0.001592653589793 \u2248 approx 5.08. So, total\u2248318.2 + 127.28 + 5.08\u2248450.56. So, total 3182\u03c0\u22489546 + 450.56\u224810,000.56. So, 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22481/10000.56\u22480.000099994, which is approximately 0.000099994, which is less than 0.0001. Therefore, n=3182 gives x\u22480.000099994, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the maximum n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3181. Let's check n=3181: 3181\u03c0\u22483181*3.14159265\u2248 let's compute 3181*3=9543, 3181*0.14159265\u22483181*0.1=318.1, 3181*0.04159265\u2248approx 3181*0.04=127.24, 3181*0.00159265\u2248approx 5.06. So total\u2248318.1 + 127.24 + 5.06\u2248450.4. So, total 3181\u03c0\u22489543 + 450.4\u224810,000. So, 1/(3181\u03c0)\u22481/10000\u22480.0001, which is exactly 0.0001, but since the interval is open, x=0.0001 is not included. So, n=3181 gives x\u22480.0001, which is not included. Therefore, the maximum n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3180. Let's check n=3180: 3180\u03c0\u22483180*3.14159265\u22483180*3=9540, 3180*0.14159265\u22483180*0.1=318, 3180*0.04159265\u2248approx 3180*0.04=127.2, 3180*0.00159265\u2248approx 5.05. So total\u2248318 + 127.2 + 5.05\u2248450.25. So, 3180\u03c0\u22489540 + 450.25\u224810,000.25. So, 1/(3180\u03c0)\u22481/10000.25\u22480.0000999975, which is still less than 0.0001. Hmm, so n=3180 gives x\u22480.0000999975, still less than 0.0001. So, perhaps I need to go lower. Let me try n=3179: 3179\u03c0\u22483179*3.14159265\u22483179*3=9537, 3179*0.14159265\u22483179*0.1=317.9, 3179*0.04159265\u2248approx 3179*0.04=127.16, 3179*0.00159265\u2248approx 5.04. So total\u2248317.9 + 127.16 + 5.04\u2248450.1. So, 3179\u03c0\u22489537 + 450.1\u224810,000.1. So, 1/(3179\u03c0)\u22481/10000.1\u22480.000099999, which is still less than 0.0001. Hmm, seems like even n=3179 gives x less than 0.0001. Maybe I need to go lower. Let me try n=3178: 3178\u03c0\u22483178*3.14159265\u22483178*3=9534, 3178*0.14159265\u22483178*0.1=317.8, 3178*0.04159265\u2248approx 3178*0.04=127.12, 3178*0.00159265\u2248approx 5.03. So total\u2248317.8 + 127.12 + 5.03\u2248450. So, 3178\u03c0\u22489534 + 450\u224810,000. So, 1/(3178\u03c0)\u22481/10000\u22480.0001, which is exactly the lower bound, but since the interval is open, it's not included. So, n=3178 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3177. Let's check n=3177: 3177\u03c0\u22483177*3.14159265\u22483177*3=9531, 3177*0.14159265\u22483177*0.1=317.7, 3177*0.04159265\u2248approx 3177*0.04=127.08, 3177*0.00159265\u2248approx 5.02. So total\u2248317.7 + 127.08 + 5.02\u2248450. So, 3177\u03c0\u22489531 + 450\u224810,000 - 9531 + 9531 + 450=10,000 - 9531 is 469, so 9531 + 450=9981. Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, 3177\u03c0\u22483177*3.14159265\u2248 let me compute more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a calculator approach. Let me compute 3177 * \u03c0:\n\nCompute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796\n\nCompute 177\u03c0 \u2248 177 * 3.14159265 \u2248 let's compute 170\u03c0\u2248534.0708, 7\u03c0\u224821.9911, so total\u2248534.0708 + 21.9911\u2248556.0619\n\nSo, total 3177\u03c0\u22489424.77796 + 556.0619\u22489980.83986\n\nSo, 1/(3177\u03c0)\u22481/9980.83986\u22480.000100193, which is approximately 0.000100193, which is greater than 0.0001, so x=1/(3177\u03c0)\u22480.000100193 is included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n=3177 gives x\u22480.000100193, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, the maximum n is 3177. So, n ranges from 319 to 3177 inclusive. Now, let's compute the number of integers between 319 and 3177 inclusive. That's 3177 - 319 + 1. Let's compute 3177 - 319: 3177 - 300=2877, then subtract 19 more: 2877 - 19=2858. Then add 1: 2858 + 1=2859. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2859. Wait, but let me confirm this because earlier calculations were giving different results. Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's consider the interval for x: 0.0001 < x < 0.001. So, taking reciprocals, 1000 < 1/x < 10000. So, 1/x must be between 1000 and 10000. Now, since 1/x = n\u03c0, where n is an integer, we have 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. As calculated before, 1000/\u03c0\u2248318.309886 and 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.09886. So, n must be an integer greater than 318.309886 and less than 3183.09886. Therefore, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. But as we saw earlier, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0000999995, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Similarly, n=3177 gives x\u22480.000100193, which is included. So, the maximum n is 3177. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3177 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3177 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3177 - 319 = 2858, then +1 is 2859. So, there are 2859 x-intercepts. But wait, earlier when I thought n went up to 3182, I got 2864, but after correcting, it's 2859. Hmm, seems like I need to make sure about the exact value of n where x=1/(n\u03c0) crosses 0.0001. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the exact value of n where x=0.0001, which is 1/(n\u03c0)=0.0001, so n=10000/\u03c0\u22483183.09886. So, the integer part is 3183, but since n must be less than that to have x>0.0001, the maximum n is 3183 -1=3182. But as we saw, n=3182 gives x\u22480.000099994, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182 -1=3181, but that also gives x\u22480.0001, which is excluded. Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe a better approach is to compute the floor and ceiling functions. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0\u2248318.309886 and less than 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.09886. So, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest integer n is 3183. But as we saw, n=3183 gives x\u22480.0000999995, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the largest n is 3182, but n=3182 gives x\u22480.000099994, which is still less than 0.0001, so excluded. So, the largest n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3183 - k, where k is the smallest integer such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the exact n where x=0.0001, which is n=10000/\u03c0\u22483183.09886. So, the integer part is 3183, but since n must be less than that, the maximum n is 3183 -1=3182, but as we saw, n=3182 gives x less than 0.0001. Therefore, the maximum n is 3183 -1=3182, but since that's excluded, perhaps the maximum n is 3183 -2=3181, but that also gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. Wait, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe the correct approach is to realize that the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0\u2248318.309886 and less than 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.09886. Therefore, the number of integers n is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0) + 1. So, floor(10000/\u03c0)=floor(3183.09886)=3183. ceil(1000/\u03c0)=ceil(318.309886)=319. So, number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1=2865. But wait, as we saw earlier, n=3183 gives x less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the correct number is floor(10000/\u03c0) -1 - ceil(1000/\u03c0) +1=3183 -1 -319 +1=3183 -319 -1 +1=3183 -319=2864. So, 2864. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the number of n's where n\u03c0 is in (1000, 10000). So, the number of n's is the number of integers between 319 and 3183, inclusive, minus the number of n's where n\u03c0 is less than or equal to 10000 but greater than 1000. Wait, no, that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0) +1, which is 3183 - 319 +1=2865, but since n=3183 gives x less than 0.0001, we subtract 1, getting 2864. So, the answer is 2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) has x-intercepts where \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\), which occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for integer \\( n \\).

Taking reciprocals on both sides (remembering to flip the inequality sign because I'm dealing with positive numbers), I get: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. 1/0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0: 10000/\u03c0 > n. Let me compute 10000 divided by \u03c0. Since \u03c0 is approximately 3.1416, 10000/3.1416 \u2248 3183.098. So, n < 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n can be at most 3183. Now, the right inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001. 1/0.001 is 1000, so n\u03c0 > 1000. Dividing both sides by \u03c0: n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. Since n must be an integer, n must be at least 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, to find how many integers are in this range, I subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add one (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me calculate that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with the inequalities: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, for n, we have 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which leads to 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n starts at 319. 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n goes up to 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Yeah, that seems correct.

Calculating 1/0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0: n < 10000/\u03c0. Similarly, for the right inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001 = 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Therefore, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Now, let's compute these values numerically. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000/\u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, n must be greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184. So, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both ends are inclusive). Wait, let me make sure: The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here a = 319 and b = 3183. So, number of integers = 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n in that range. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 1000/\u03c0 is approximately 318.309, so the next integer is 319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 is approximately 3183.098, so the largest integer less than that is 3183. So, from 319 to 3183 inclusive, the count is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more to get 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 is 2865. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). For x in (0.0001, 0.001), n must satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183, giving 2865 intercepts.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

    "text": " Let's take the first inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Taking reciprocals on both sides (and remembering that reversing the inequality when taking reciprocals since both sides are positive), we get: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0, which is 10000 > n\u03c0. Similarly, for the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals again: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is n\u03c0 > 1000. So now, combining both inequalities, we have: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing through by \u03c0 to solve for n, we get: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926536. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926536 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926536 \u2248 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, n must satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Now, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, 3183 - 318 = 2865, and then adding 1 gives 2866. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check my subtraction: 3183 minus 318. Let's compute 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 18 more: 2883 - 18 = 2865. So, yes, 2865. Then adding 1 gives 2866. So, there are 2866 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2866 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the range for n. Let me go back. The inequalities were 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n starts at the next integer after 318.309..., which is 319, and goes up to the integer before 3183.09886184, which is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 is 2865. Wait, that's different from what I had before. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify: The formula for the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, from 319 to 3183, it's 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then +1 gives 2865. So, the correct number is 2865. Wait, so earlier I thought it was 2866, but now it's 2865. Which is correct? Let me check with a smaller example. Suppose I have numbers from 3 to 5 inclusive. 5 - 3 +1 = 3 numbers: 3,4,5. Yes, that works. So, applying that, 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, the correct number is 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in that interval. But wait, let me make sure that each n corresponds to a unique x in the interval. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), as n increases, x decreases, right? So, as n goes from 319 to 3183, x goes from 1/(319\u03c0) down to 1/(3183\u03c0). Let me check if these x values lie within (0.0001, 0.001). Let's compute 1/(319\u03c0) and 1/(3183\u03c0). 1/(319 * 3.1415926536) \u2248 1/(1002.001) \u2248 0.000998, which is just under 0.001, so that's within the interval. Similarly, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.000) \u2248 0.0001, but since 0.0001 is excluded, we need to make sure that 1/(3183\u03c0) > 0.0001. Wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10000 \u2248 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so n can be up to 3183, as 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.999, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000001, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included. Similarly, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000998, which is just under 0.001, so it's included. Therefore, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive give x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me confirm the calculation one more time. 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Thus, n ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 x-intercepts.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"
