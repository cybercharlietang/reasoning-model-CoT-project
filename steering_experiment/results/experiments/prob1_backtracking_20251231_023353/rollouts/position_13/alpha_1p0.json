    "text": " Let's take the left inequality first: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, the inequality will reverse because both sides are positive. So, 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. 1/0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, we get n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating that, \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000/3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n is an integer, the maximum possible n is 3183. Now, let's take the right inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001. 1/0.001 is 1000, so n\u03c0 > 1000. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, we get n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000/3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618. Since n is an integer, the smallest possible n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to count how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the values, it's 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, and then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's verify the bounds again. When n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0). Let's compute that: 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.14159265 \u2248 1003.216. So, 1/1003.216 \u2248 0.0009968, which is approximately 0.0009968, which is indeed greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. Wait, but 0.0009968 is less than 0.001, so that's correct. Now, when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.14159265) \u2248 1/10000.0001 \u2248 0.0000999999, which is just under 0.0001, but wait, that's less than 0.0001, which is outside our interval. Wait, that can't be right because we had n < 3183.0988618, so n can be up to 3183. Let me check the calculation again. 3183 * \u03c0 is approximately 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 10000.0001. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10000.0001 \u2248 0.00009999999, which is just below 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. So, actually, n can't be 3183 because that would place x just below 0.0001, which is not in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, the maximum n is 3182. Let me check n = 3182: 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.14159265 \u2248 let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 182\u03c0 \u2248 571.884, so total is approximately 9424.77796 + 571.884 \u2248 9996.662. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.662 \u2248 0.000100033, which is just above 0.0001, so that's within the interval. So, n can be 319 up to 3182. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, that's 2864 x-intercepts. Wait, earlier I thought it was 2865, but now I'm getting 2864. Which one is correct? Let's check again. The initial calculation gave n from 319 to 3183, but when n=3183, x is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, the maximum n is 3182. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3182. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3182 - 319 + 1 = 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, the correct number is 2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n gives 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3182, resulting in 2864 integer values.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}."

    "text": " Let me take the reciprocals, but remembering that flipping the inequalities will reverse them. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those reciprocals: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Now, dividing each part by \u03c0 to solve for n: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.3098861. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.098861. So, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.3098861 and less than approximately 3183.098861. Since n has to be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319, and the largest possible n is 3183. Now, to find how many integers are between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n in that range. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I set sin(1/x) = 0, so 1/x = n\u03c0, which gives x = 1/(n\u03c0). Then, I substituted x into the interval 0.0001 < x < 0.001, leading to 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals, I correctly reversed the inequalities to get 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, then divided by \u03c0 to get n between approximately 318.31 and 3183.0988. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The count is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more to get 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct. Hmm, but wait, let me check if 1/(318\u03c0) is greater than 0.001 and 1/(319\u03c0) is less than 0.001, or the other way around. Wait, no, actually, when n increases, x decreases because x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, higher n gives smaller x. So, the smallest x in the interval is 0.0001, which is 1/10000, so 1/(n\u03c0) = 0.0001 implies n\u03c0 = 10000, so n = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988. So, the maximum n is 3183 because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159 \u2248 3183*3=9549, 3183*0.14159\u2248450. So total \u2248 9549 + 450 \u2248 9999, which is just under 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is just over 0.0001. Similarly, the lower bound is n=319, so 319\u03c0 \u2248 319*3.14159 \u2248 319*3=957, 319*0.14159\u224845. So, total \u2248 957 + 45 \u2248 1002, which is just over 1000, so 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000998, which is just under 0.001. So, that means n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183, inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but let me check with n=318: 318\u03c0 \u2248 318*3.14159 \u2248 318*3=954, 318*0.14159\u224845. So, total \u2248 954 + 45 \u2248 999, which is just under 1000. So, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.001001, which is just over 0.001, so n=318 is outside the upper bound. So, the first n is 319, as I thought. So, the count is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n.

The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

    "text": " Let's take the left inequality first: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that reversing the inequality because both sides are positive, so: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Which simplifies to 10000 > n\u03c0. So, n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1416 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.098. Since n is an integer, n \u2264 3183. Now, the right inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, take reciprocals, remembering to flip the inequality: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001 = 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309. Since n is an integer, n \u2265 319. So, putting it all together, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers in this range, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add one (since both endpoints are included). So, number of x-intercepts = 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then adding 1 gives 2865. Wait, let me check that subtraction again. 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then minus 19 more is 2864. So, 2864 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the bounds. Let me verify the calculations step by step. First, solving for n in 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 1/(0.0001 * \u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so n \u2264 3183. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n \u2265 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because for each n from 319 to 3183, there's exactly one x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, each n corresponds to one x-intercept. Therefore, the total number should indeed be 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me just cross-verify by plugging in the endpoints. Let's take n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.1) \u2248 0.0009968, which is greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. Similarly, n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) \u2248 0.0001, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), it's open at 0.0001, so x must be greater than 0.0001. Wait, so x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, x must be strictly greater than 0.0001. So, does x = 1/(3183\u03c0) lie within the interval? Let's compute 1/(3183\u03c0). 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but exactly, it's slightly more than 0.0001 because 3183\u03c0 is slightly less than 10000. Wait, no, 3183 * 3.1416 is approximately 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001. Wait, that would mean x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, which is the lower bound. But our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001. So, does n = 3183 give x within the interval? Let me compute more accurately. Let's compute 3183 * \u03c0. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let's compute 3000 * \u03c0 = 9424.77796. Then, 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 574.743. So, total is approximately 9424.77796 + 574.743 \u2248 10,000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10,000, 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, which is the lower bound of the interval. Therefore, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is not included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n = 3183 gives x just below 0.0001, which is outside the interval. So, the maximum n for which x = 1/(n\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001 is n where 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, the maximum integer n is 3183, but as we saw, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is just below 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n such that x > 0.0001 is n = 3183 - 1 = 3182. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. If n = 3183 gives x \u2248 0.0001, but just below, then n = 3182 would give x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000 - \u03c0) \u2248 0.00010001, which is just above 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3182\u03c0) is approximately 0.00010001, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. Wait, but earlier, when I calculated n < 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, n must be such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which is n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but as we saw, n = 3183 gives x \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. So, now, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3182, inclusive. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but now I'm getting 2864 because n goes up to 3182 instead of 3183. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me double-check.\n\nFirst, let's define the interval: x is in (0.0001, 0.001). So, x must satisfy 0.0001 < x < 0.001.\n\nWe have x = 1/(n\u03c0), so substituting, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nSolving for n:\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, we get n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098.\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, we get n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 318.309 < n < 3183.098.\n\nSince n must be an integer, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that n = 3183 gives x \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded because the interval is open at 0.0001. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nWait, but if n = 3183 gives x \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded, then n must be up to 3182, because n = 3182 gives x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010001, which is just above 0.0001, so included.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought n goes up to 3183, but since that gives x just below 0.0001, it's excluded, so n goes up to 3182, making the total 2864.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 2864.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another approach.\n\nLet me consider the function y = sin(1/x). The zeros occur at 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0).\n\nWe need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nTaking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities):\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nCalculating:\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309\n\n10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098\n\nSo, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that n = 3183 gives x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but x must be greater than 0.0001, so x = 1/(3183\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001.\n\nWait, but 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but is it greater or less?\n\nLet me compute 3183 * \u03c0:\n\n3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000, 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001. Therefore, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded.\n\nTherefore, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is excluded, so the maximum n is 3182.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nNumber of integers: 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but another way: the number of integers between a and b inclusive is b - a + 1.\n\nSo, from 319 to 3182 inclusive, it's 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with specific values.\n\nTake n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.1) \u2248 0.0009968, which is greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001, so included.\n\nTake n = 3182: x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182*3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000 - something) \u2248 0.00010001, which is greater than 0.0001, so included.\n\nTake n = 3183: x \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so excluded.\n\nTherefore, n goes from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nSo, the answer is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but now I'm getting 2864 because n = 3183 is excluded. So, the correct number is 2864.\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the subtraction.\n\n3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863. Then add 1: 2864.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is: the number of zeros is the number of times 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0 as x moves from 0.001 to 0.0001. Since 1/x decreases from 1000 to 10000 as x increases from 0.001 to 0.0001. Wait, no, as x increases, 1/x decreases. So, when x goes from 0.001 to 0.0001, 1/x goes from 1000 to 10000. So, the function sin(1/x) oscillates between -1 and 1, crossing zero each time 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0.\n\nSo, the number of zeros is the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000.\n\nWait, that's a different way to phrase it.\n\nSo, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nDividing by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nWhich is approximately 318.309 < n < 3183.098.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought n = 3183 gives x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded. So, in this approach, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which would give 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 zeros.\n\nBut this contradicts the earlier conclusion where n = 3183 gives x \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded, so n should go up to 3182.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused now.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nWhen x is in (0.0001, 0.001), 1/x is in (1000, 10000). So, we're looking for the number of integers n such that n\u03c0 is in (1000, 10000). That is, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nSo, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nEach such n corresponds to a zero at x = 1/(n\u03c0), which is in (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that n = 3183 gives x \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded. So, is x = 1/(3183\u03c0) in (0.0001, 0.001)?\n\nWait, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but is it greater than 0.0001?\n\nSince 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but slightly less, because 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000.\n\nWait, no: 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000, 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001.\n\nTherefore, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded from the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nTherefore, n = 3183 is excluded, so n must go up to 3182.\n\nTherefore, the number of zeros is from n = 319 to n = 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nBut wait, in the previous approach where I considered n\u03c0 between 1000 and 10000, I included n = 3183, but that gives x = 1/(3183\u03c0) < 0.0001, which is excluded. So, the correct number is 2864.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with another example. Suppose I take n = 3182: x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000 - 3.1416) \u2248 0.00010003, which is greater than 0.0001, so included.\n\nn = 3183: x \u2248 0.00009997, which is less than 0.0001, excluded.\n\nSo, n goes up to 3182.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nSo, the final answer is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n gives n between approximately 318.309 and 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}."

    "text": " Let's take the reciprocal of all parts, remembering that taking reciprocals reverses the inequalities because all terms are positive. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those reciprocals: 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10,000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10,000. Now, divide all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10,000/\u03c0. Let me calculate those values. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10,000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10,000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319, and the largest possible n is 3183. Now, to find how many integers are between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, 3183 - 318 = 2865, and 2865 + 1 = 2866. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my calculation again. Wait, 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that. 3183 - 319 is 2864, so 2864 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, so there are 2865 integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go back through the steps. Starting from x = 1/(n\u03c0), and x is between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals: 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10,000. Dividing by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 < n < 10,000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183. Now, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me think again. Is every n in that range corresponding to exactly one x in the interval? Since for each n, x = 1/(n\u03c0) is unique and lies within the interval, yes. So, each n gives exactly one x-intercept. Therefore, the total number is 2865. So, the answer should be 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 1/(n\u03c0) must be between 0.0001 and 0.001. Solving for n gives n between approximately 318.31 and 3183.09. Thus, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, giving 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

Let me compute those values. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be an integer strictly greater than approximately 318.309886184 and strictly less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, n starts at the next integer after 318.309886184, which is 319, and goes up to the integer just below 3183.09886184, which is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, applying that here: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait a minute, let me double-check that. So, the interval is from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is from 10^{-4} to 10^{-3}. So, x is between 10^{-4} and 10^{-3}. Then, 1/x is between 10^3 and 10^4, so 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, x must be between 10^{-4} and 10^{-3}, so 10^{-4} < 1/(n\u03c0) < 10^{-3}, which is the same as 10^3 < n\u03c0 < 10^4, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must be between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which as I calculated before is approximately 318.31 to 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then +1 is 2865. So, yes, that seems correct. But wait, let me make sure that 1/(319\u03c0) is indeed greater than 0.0001 and 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.001. Let me compute 1/(319\u03c0). 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 1002. So, 1/(1002) \u2248 0.000998, which is approximately 0.001, but wait, 0.000998 is less than 0.001, so 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000998, which is greater than 0.0001, so that's okay. Similarly, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, but let me compute it more accurately. 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 Let's compute 3000 * 3.1416 = 9424.8, and 183 * 3.1416 \u2248 183 * 3 = 549, 183 * 0.1416 \u2248 25.97, so total \u2248 549 + 25.97 \u2248 574.97, so total 9424.8 + 574.97 \u2248 9999.77. So, 1/(9999.77) \u2248 0.0001000023, which is just over 0.0001, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000023, which is just above 0.0001, so x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is just above 0.0001, which is within our interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but the interval is open, so 0.0001 is excluded. So, does 1/(3183\u03c0) equal exactly 0.0001? Let me check. 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.14159265) \u2248 1/10000.00000023, which is approximately 0.0001. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) is very close to 0.0001, but just slightly above it, so since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, it doesn't include 0.0001. Therefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. Similarly, 1/(319\u03c0) is approximately 0.000998, which is less than 0.001, so it's included as well. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 2865 x-intercepts. Wait, but let me check: when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000998, which is within (0.0001, 0.001). When n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000023, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. So, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive will give x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, the answer is 2865.

Dividing by \u03c0, I got n between approximately 318.31 and 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, the smallest n is 319 and the largest is 3183. The count is 3183 - 319 + 1.

Since n is an integer, the maximum possible n is 3183. Now, let's look at the upper bound: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 318.3098862. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.3098862. Since n is an integer, the smallest possible n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers in this range, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The lower bound for n was 319, and the upper bound was 3183. Subtracting 319 from 3183 gives 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Yeah, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of it as the number of integers from 1 to 3183 is 3183, and from 1 to 318 is 318. So, subtracting, 3183 - 318 = 2865. That matches. So, I think the answer is 2865 x-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. Within the interval (0.0001, 0.001), we find that n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

Calculating 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Now, divide all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so let's compute 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0. 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n must be greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184. So, n can take integer values starting from 319 up to 3183. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, 3183 - 318 = 2865, and 2865 + 1 = 2866. Wait, but let me double-check that. If n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, the number of terms is 3183 - 318 = 2865, but since both 319 and 3183 are included, we add 1, making it 2866. Hmm, but let me think again. Let's take a smaller example to test this. Suppose I have integers from 1 to 5. The count is 5 - 1 + 1 = 5, which is correct. Similarly, from 3 to 7, it's 7 - 3 + 1 = 5, which is correct. So, applying that here, it's 3183 - 319 + 1. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, because n starts at 319, so the first term is 319, then 320, up to 3183. So, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that's different from my previous calculation. Hmm, so which is correct? Let me check again. If n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. So, 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Alternatively, if I think of it as n_min = 319, n_max = 3183, then the count is n_max - n_min + 1, which is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that's correct. Therefore, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. So, each n corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0), and all these x's lie within (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial inequality. So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so n must be less than that, so n_max is 3183. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so n must be greater than that, so n_min is 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 intercepts.

For n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0). Let me compute that. 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 1002.344. So, x \u2248 1/1002.344 \u2248 0.0009976, which is approximately 0.001, but slightly less. Wait, 0.0009976 is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, for n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0). Let's compute 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 10000.000 something. Wait, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 10000, so x \u2248 1/10000 = 0.0001. But our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at both ends. So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since it's an open interval, x must be greater than 0.0001. So, does x = 1/(3183\u03c0) equal exactly 0.0001? Let me check: 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since the interval is open, 0.0001 is excluded, so x must be greater than 0.0001. Therefore, n = 3183 gives x \u2248 0.0001, which is not included in the interval. So, perhaps n should go up to 3182 instead of 3183. Let me check that. For n = 3182, x = 1/(3182\u03c0). Let's compute 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535. Let's compute 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.777, and 182 * \u03c0 \u2248 571.592, so total is approximately 9424.777 + 571.592 \u2248 10,000. So, 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 10,000 - \u03c0 \u2248 9996.862. Therefore, x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.862 \u2248 0.00010003, which is just over 0.0001. So, that's within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n = 3182 gives x \u2248 0.00010003, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Similarly, n = 3183 gives x \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. So, now, let's recalculate the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3182 - 319. 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863. Then, 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, there are 2864 integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by including n = 3183, which gives x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded. So, the correct count is 2864. Let me confirm this again. The smallest n is 319, giving x \u2248 0.0009976, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. The largest n is 3182, giving x \u2248 0.00010003, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that step by step. 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, 2864 x-intercepts. Therefore, the final answer should be 2864. But wait, let me check with another approach to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another way to think about it is that the function sin(1/x) oscillates increasingly rapidly as x approaches 0. Each oscillation crosses the x-axis twice, but in this case, we're only counting the zeros where 1/x crosses an integer multiple of \u03c0. So, each n corresponds to one x-intercept. So, the number of x-intercepts is the number of integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in (0.0001, 0.001). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Which implies 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, as before. So, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. As we computed earlier, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184. Therefore, n can be 319, 320, ..., 3183. But wait, earlier I thought n = 3183 gives x \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded, so n goes up to 3182. Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing the inequalities. Let me write it as n > 1000/\u03c0 and n < 10000/\u03c0. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. So, n can be from 319 to 3183 inclusive because 3183 is less than 3183.09886184, so n = 3183 is allowed? Wait, no, because 3183 is less than 3183.09886184, so n = 3183 is allowed, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, which is not included in the open interval. So, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is just less than 0.0001, which is not included. Wait, but 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but is it greater or less than 0.0001? Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but slightly less, because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 exactly. Wait, but 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000, because 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 let's see, 3000 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 424.777, and 183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 25.928, so total \u2248 424.777 + 25.928 \u2248 450.705. So, total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9549 + 450.705 \u2248 9999.705. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.705, which is just under 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.705 \u2248 0.0001000029, which is just over 0.0001. Therefore, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000029, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. So, if 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.705, then 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000029, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, n can go up to 3183, because x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000029 is within the interval. So, that means n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 is 2865. So, 2865 integers. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but earlier I thought n = 3183 gives x \u2248 0.0001000029, which is included, so the count should be from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, I think my initial correction was wrong because I thought x = 1/(3183\u03c0) was exactly 0.0001, but actually, it's slightly over, so it's included. Therefore, the correct count is 2865. So, I think the answer is 2865 x-intercepts. Let me just confirm once more. The smallest n is 319, which gives x \u2248 0.0009976, which is less than 0.001, so included. The largest n is 3183, which gives x \u2248 0.0001000029, which is greater than 0.0001, so included. Therefore, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.

    "text": " Let's take the first inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that flipping the inequality when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive, I get: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0, which is 10000 > n\u03c0. Similarly, for the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, taking reciprocals gives: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is n\u03c0 > 1000. So now I have two inequalities: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute those values numerically. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535. Let me calculate that: 1000 \u00f7 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. But n has to be an integer because we're dealing with multiples of \u03c0. So, the smallest integer n that is greater than 318.309886184 is 319, and the largest integer n that is less than 3183.09886184 is 3183. Now, to find how many integers are between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then add 1 if necessary. Wait, actually, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 integers n such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, hold on a second. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so the next integer is 319. 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so the integer part is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more gives 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 is 2865. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Hmm, but wait, I should consider whether the endpoints are included or not. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, not closed. So, x = 0.0001 and x = 0.001 are not included. But when I found x = 1/(n\u03c0), I need to check if 1/(n\u03c0) is strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. So, x = 1/(n\u03c0) must satisfy 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Which is the same as 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must be such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the count is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, even though the interval is open, the x-intercepts are at points strictly inside, so we don't need to worry about the endpoints. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. To find the number of such x in (0.0001, 0.001), we solve 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, leading to 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. This gives n between approximately 318.31 and 3183.09. Thus, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, yielding 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

Wait, 3183 minus 319 is actually 2864, but wait, let me verify that: 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then minus 19 more is 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865.

Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 is 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n that satisfy 318.309 < n < 3183.098.

Wait, but just to make sure, let me check if x = 1/(319\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001 and x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.001. Let's compute 1/(319\u03c0): 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.14159265 \u2248 1003. So, 1/1003 \u2248 0.000997, which is greater than 0.0001. Wait, that's not right.

Wait, that can't be right because 10000/\u03c0 is approximately 3183.098861, so 3183 * \u03c0 is approximately 10000 - a bit. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000 - 0.098861\u03c0 \u2248 10000 - 0.3098861 \u2248 9999.690114. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.690114 \u2248 0.000100003, which is just over 0.0001. Hmm, but our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.000100003, which is just barely above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. Similarly, 1/(319\u03c0) is approximately 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's included as well. Wait, but earlier I thought 1/(319\u03c0) is about 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so that's fine. But let me confirm the endpoints again. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) must be in (0.0001, 0.001). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, solving for n: 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. As calculated earlier, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098861, so n must be greater than 318.3098861, so the smallest integer n is 319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098861, so n must be less than 3183.098861, so the largest integer n is 3183. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which gives 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 integers. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's the answer. Wait, but just to make sure, let me consider if there's any chance that n=3183 would give x=1/(3183\u03c0) which is just over 0.0001, but since the interval is open, does that matter? Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0) numerically. Let's compute 3183 * \u03c0. \u03c0 is approximately 3.141592653589793. So, 3183 * 3.141592653589793. Let me compute 3000 * \u03c0 = 9424.77796. Then, 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 574.5151. So, total is 9424.77796 + 574.5151 \u2248 10,000. So, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 10,000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10,000 = 0.0001. But since 3183 * \u03c0 is slightly more than 10,000, 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001. Wait, no, if 3183 * \u03c0 is approximately 10,000, then 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001. But since 3183 * \u03c0 is slightly more than 10,000, 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is just below 0.0001, which is the lower bound of the interval. But our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001. Therefore, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's not included in the interval. Therefore, the largest n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001 is n=3182. Wait, let me check that. Let's compute 1/(3182\u03c0). Let's see: 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.14159265 \u2248 3182 * 3 = 9546, 3182 * 0.14159265 \u2248 3182 * 0.1416 \u2248 3182 * 0.1 = 318.2, 3182 * 0.0416 \u2248 3182 * 0.04 = 127.28, 3182 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0912, so total \u2248 318.2 + 127.28 + 5.0912 \u2248 450.5712. So, total 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9546 + 450.5712 \u2248 9996.5712. Therefore, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.5712 \u2248 0.000100034, which is just over 0.0001. So, x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100034, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. So, n=3182 gives x\u22480.000100034, which is within the interval. Similarly, n=3183 gives x\u22480.00010001, which is just below 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the largest n is 3182. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought n went up to 3183, but now I realize that n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so n=3183 is excluded. Therefore, the correct upper limit is n=3182. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. So, that's the correct count. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Hmm, so I think I made a mistake earlier by including n=3183, but upon closer examination, n=3183 gives x just below 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the correct count is 2864. Wait, but let me confirm again. Let me compute 1/(3182\u03c0) and 1/(3183\u03c0). As above, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9996.5712, so 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100034, which is just over 0.0001, so included. 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000.000001, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099999, which is just under 0.0001, so excluded. Therefore, n can go up to 3182. Therefore, the number of integers is from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Hmm, so I think my initial answer was 2865, but upon correcting for the open interval, it's 2864. So, that's the correct count. Therefore, the answer is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0).

    "text": " Let me take reciprocals on all parts, remembering that taking reciprocals reverses the inequalities because all terms are positive. So, taking reciprocals: 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001 That simplifies to: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000 So, dividing all parts by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0 Let me compute these values numerically. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n must be greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184. So, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183. Now, to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is given by b - a + 1. So, plugging in the numbers: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again. Hmm, 3183 - 319 is 2864, yes, and adding 1 gives 2865. But let me think again: if n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2865. So, that seems correct. Therefore, there are 2865 integer values of n, each corresponding to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, the number of x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2865. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial setup. I set x = 1/(n\u03c0) and found the range for n by substituting the endpoints of the interval. So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988, and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which gives 2865 intercepts. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think about how the function sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. As x approaches 0 from the positive side, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a small interval near zero, the function will oscillate a large number of times, each oscillation crossing the x-axis twice (once going up, once going down), except possibly the first one if it's a half-period. But wait, actually, each full period of sin(\u03b8) is 2\u03c0, so each time \u03b8 increases by 2\u03c0, the function completes a full cycle, crossing zero twice. But in our case, since we're looking for the number of zeros, each zero corresponds to \u03b8 = n\u03c0, so each zero is spaced by \u03c0 in \u03b8. So, as \u03b8 increases from 1/0.001 = 1000 to 1/0.0001 = 10000, the number of zeros is the number of times \u03b8 crosses n\u03c0 in that interval. The number of n's where n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which is the same as before. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 zeros. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that makes sense.

So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001 Calculating the reciprocals: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Now, divide each part by \u03c0 to solve for n: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must satisfy 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184. But n has to be an integer, so n can take integer values starting from the next integer after 318.309886184, which is 319, up to the integer just below 3183.09886184, which is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think: The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, in this case, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from sin(1/x) = 0, so 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). Then, substituting into the interval: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals gives 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so dividing by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183, which is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct. I don't see any errors in my reasoning. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, hold on a second.

Alternatively, I can think of it as starting at n=1, and the total number up to n=3183 is 3183, and subtracting the numbers before 319, which are 318 numbers (from n=1 to n=318).

Let me compute these values. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.3098861.

So, n must be greater than 318.309..., so the smallest integer n is 319, and less than 3183.098..., so the largest integer n is 3183. The count from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Yep, that seems right. So, I think I did everything correctly.

So, 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and 2864 + 1 is 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 integer values of n that satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Each such n corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 3183.0988, so n must be less than that, so the maximum integer n is 3183. For the lower bound, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 318.3098, so n must be greater than that, so the smallest integer n is 319. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. That seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me think again. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. So, between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a very small interval near zero, the function oscillates rapidly. Each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the sine function completes a half-period, leading to a zero crossing. So, the number of zeros should be roughly proportional to the change in 1/x over the interval. Let me compute the change in 1/x: When x = 0.001, 1/x = 1000. When x = 0.0001, 1/x = 10000. So, the interval for \u03b8 = 1/x is from 1000 to 10000. The number of zeros of sin(\u03b8) between \u03b8 = a and \u03b8 = b is approximately (b - a)/\u03c0, because each zero is \u03c0 apart. So, the number of zeros would be roughly (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 = 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.198. Hmm, but my earlier calculation gave me 2865. The difference is due to the endpoints: whether \u03b8 = 1000 and \u03b8 = 10000 are included or not. Since our interval for x is open, (0.0001, 0.001), that corresponds to \u03b8 in (1000, 10000). So, \u03b8 does not include 1000 or 10000. Therefore, the number of zeros would be the number of integers n such that \u03b8 = n\u03c0 lies strictly between 1000 and 10000. So, n\u03c0 > 1000 and n\u03c0 < 10000. Which gives n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098 and n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of such n is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that's consistent with my previous result. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's correct. So, the answer is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). For x in (0.0001, 0.001), we find the range of n as 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183, giving 2865 x-intercepts.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001 Calculating the reciprocals: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000 So, dividing all parts by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0 Let me compute these values. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n must be greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184. So, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183. Now, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in that interval. Wait, let me double-check my calculations. So, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so n starts at 319. 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so n ends at 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2865. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's the answer. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial substitution. So, the function is sin(1/x), so when does that equal zero? When 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). That's correct. Then, substituting into the interval: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Which is approximately 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. Number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Yeah, that seems right.

    "text": " Let's take the reciprocal of all parts, remembering that reversing the inequalities when taking reciprocals. So, if 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, then 1/(0.001) > n\u03c0 > 1/(0.0001). Calculating 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 > n\u03c0 > 10000. Wait, that seems off because 1000 is less than 10000, so the inequalities should be reversed when taking reciprocals. Let me correct that. Starting again: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals, we get 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Now, dividing all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me calculate those values. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.30988618. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1416 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.30988618 and less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n must be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319 and the largest possible n is 3183. Now, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1. Wait, no, actually, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, each n corresponds to a unique x in the interval, right? Because each x = 1/(n\u03c0) is unique for each n, and since n ranges from 319 to 3183, each x will be in (0.0001, 0.001). Let me check with n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.1) \u2248 0.0009969, which is approximately 0.000997, which is between 0.0001 and 0.001. Similarly, for n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10000, so x is approximately 0.0001, but since n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) which is just slightly larger than 0.0001, because 3183\u03c0 is slightly less than 10000. Wait, let me compute 3183 * \u03c0: 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 Let me compute 3000*3.1416=9424.8, and 183*3.1416\u2248575.36, so total is approximately 9424.8 + 575.36 \u2248 10,000.16. Wait, that's more than 10,000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000.16, so x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10000.16 \u2248 0.0000999984, which is just below 0.0001, but our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.0001. So, does x=1/(3183\u03c0) lie inside the interval? Since it's approximately 0.0000999984, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. So, perhaps n=3183 gives x just below 0.0001, which is outside the interval. Therefore, the maximum n that gives x within the interval is n=3182, because 3182\u03c0 would be slightly less than 3183\u03c0, so x=1/(3182\u03c0) would be slightly larger than 1/(3183\u03c0), which is just above 0.0001. Let me check that. 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 Let's compute 3000*3.1416=9424.8, 182*3.1416\u2248572.11, so total \u2248 9424.8 + 572.11 \u2248 9996.91. So, x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.91 \u2248 0.000100031, which is approximately 0.000100031, which is just above 0.0001, so it is included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n can go up to 3182. Similarly, for n=319, as I calculated earlier, x\u22480.000997, which is within the interval. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3182. Therefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, there are 2864 integer values of n between 319 and 3182 inclusive. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought n went up to 3183, but now I see that n=3183 gives x just below 0.0001, which is excluded, so the maximum n is 3182. So, the correct count is from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. Let me verify that again. So, the initial inequality after taking reciprocals was 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must satisfy n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618 and n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be an integer greater than 318.30988618, so n starts at 319, and less than 3183.0988618, so n can go up to 3183, but as I saw, n=3183 gives x just below 0.0001, which is not included. So, n must be less than or equal to 3182. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182. So, the number of terms is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but let me check with n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.16) \u2248 0.0000999984, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, n=3182 is the last n that gives x inside the interval. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but let me confirm this calculation again to be sure. 3182 - 319 is 2863, and adding 1 gives 2864. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of it as the number of integers between a and b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, a=319, b=3182. So, 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, the answer should be 2864. Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial steps, let me recap. The function is y = sin(1/x). We're looking for x-intercepts in (0.0001, 0.001). So, sin(1/x) = 0 implies 1/x = n\u03c0, so x=1/(n\u03c0). We need x to be in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing by \u03c0, we get 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be an integer between 319 and 3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x just below 0.0001, which is excluded, so n goes up to 3182. Therefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. So, I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the logic now.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Solving for x gives x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, leading to n between approximately 319 and 3182. Thus, there are 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864 x-intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2864}$"

Let me compute these values numerically. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184.

The smallest integer greater than 318.309886184 is 319, and the largest integer less than 3183.09886184 is 3183. So, n can take integer values from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183, inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then add 1. Wait, actually, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, in this case, it's 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n in that range.

    "text": " Let's take the left inequality first: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that taking reciprocals reverses the inequality (since both sides are positive), I get: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Calculating 1/0.0001, that's 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, which is approximately 3.1416, gives n < 10000 / \u03c0. Let me compute that: 10000 / 3.1416 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.098. Since n is an integer, the maximum n can be is 3183. Now, the right inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001 = 1000. So, n > 1000 / \u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309. Since n is an integer, the smallest n can be is 319. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, it would be 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me calculate that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. So, 1/(n\u03c0) must be between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must be between 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n that satisfy the condition. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but I should consider whether the endpoints are included. The interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. But the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0). Let me check if 1/(n\u03c0) could be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. For 0.0001, that would require n = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, which is not an integer, so the closest n is 3183, which gives x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Similarly, for 0.001, n would be 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, which is not an integer, so the closest n is 319, which gives x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009996, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Wait, no, because the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, x = 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, as I had before. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to make sure, let me check with specific values. Let's take n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.8) \u2248 0.000996, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) = 0.0001, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Wait, that's a problem. So, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. Therefore, the maximum n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, the maximum integer n is 3183, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the maximum n that gives x > 0.0001 is n=3183, but since x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999 < 0.0001, it's not included. So, we need to find the smallest n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n\u03c0 < 10000 => n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n can be up to 3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the maximum n that gives x > 0.0001 is n=3182. Let me check: x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000 - \u03c0) \u2248 1/(9996.858) \u2248 0.00010003, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. So, n can go up to 3182. Similarly, for the lower bound, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Now, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, there are 2864 integer values of n, meaning 2864 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, so earlier I thought it was 2865, but now it's 2864. I must have made a mistake earlier by including n=3183, which gives x less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the correct number is 2864. Let me confirm this by another approach. The number of zeros of sin(1/x) in (a, b) is equal to the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (a, b). So, a < 1/(n\u03c0) < b. Taking reciprocals and reversing inequalities: 1/b < n\u03c0 < 1/a. So, (1/b)/\u03c0 < n < (1/a)/\u03c0. Therefore, n must be an integer in ((1/b)/\u03c0, (1/a)/\u03c0). So, here, a=0.0001, b=0.001. So, (1/0.001)/\u03c0 = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and (1/0.0001)/\u03c0 = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183. But wait, earlier I saw that n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999 < 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.098, so n=3183 is excluded, and the maximum n is 3182. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. Therefore, the correct number of x-intercepts is 2864. I think this is the accurate count because n=3183 gives x outside the interval on the lower side, so it's excluded. Therefore, the total number is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), which translates to 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Solving for n gives 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3182. The number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\n\\boxed{2864}"

Taking reciprocals on both sides (and remembering that taking reciprocals reverses the inequality for positive numbers), we get: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. 1/0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Then, dividing both sides by \u03c0: n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me calculate that. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n is an integer, the maximum possible n here is 3183.\n\nNow, let's look at the right inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001. 1/0.001 is 1000, so n\u03c0 > 1000. Dividing both sides by \u03c0: n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. Since n must be an integer, n must be at least 319.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. To find the number of integers from a to b inclusive, we can use the formula: number of integers = b - a + 1. So, plugging in a = 319 and b = 3183: number of integers = 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n between 319 and 3183, inclusive. Each of these integers corresponds to an x-intercept in the given interval. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, the substitution: x = 1/(n\u03c0). Then, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals, we get 10000 > n\u03c0 > 1000. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, so n must be greater than 318.30988618, so the next integer is 319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618, so n must be less than 3183.0988618, so the maximum integer n is 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more gives 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the interval from 0.0001 to 0.001 in x corresponds to the interval from 1000 to 10000 in 1/x. So, 1/x goes from 1000 to 10000. Since sin(\u03b8) is zero at every multiple of \u03c0, the zeros of sin(1/x) occur at \u03b8 = n\u03c0, which is 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). Therefore, \u03b8 ranges from 1000 to 10000, so n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000. Therefore, n must be between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which is the same as before. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183, giving 2865 intercepts.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). For x in (0.0001, 0.001), we find n ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 intercepts.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

    "text": " Let's take the left inequality first: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, I have to reverse the inequality sign because taking reciprocals reverses inequalities for positive numbers. So, 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. That is, 10000 > n\u03c0. Similarly, for the right inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals again, n\u03c0 > 1/0.001. So, n\u03c0 > 1000. Therefore, combining both inequalities, I have: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. To find n, I can divide all parts by \u03c0. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values numerically. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183, inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1. Wait, no, actually, since 319 is the first integer, and 3183 is the last, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183, inclusive. Each of these n values corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0) within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so the next integer is 319. 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so the integer part is 3183. So, n runs from 319 to 3183. The number of terms in this sequence is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. Yeah, that seems correct. So, 2865 x-intercepts in that interval. I think that makes sense because as x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x goes to infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is quite close to zero, the function is oscillating very rapidly, leading to a large number of x-intercepts. Each time 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0, the function crosses the x-axis. So, the number of crossings is proportional to the number of multiples of \u03c0 between 1/0.001 and 1/0.0001. Which is between 1000 and 10000. So, the number of zeros is roughly (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0, but since we're counting integers, it's a bit more precise. So, yeah, 2865 seems right. I don't think I made a mistake here, but just to be thorough, let me check if the endpoints are included correctly. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. Therefore, 1/x must be less than 10000 and greater than 1000. So, 1000 < 1/x < 10000. So, 1/x is strictly between 1000 and 10000. So, n\u03c0 must be strictly between 1000 and 10000, so n must be strictly between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0. Since n has to be an integer, the smallest n is 319, and the largest n is 3183, as before. So, the count remains 2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's solid.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

Wait, 3183 - 319 is actually 2864, and then adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, but wait, when counting the number of integers from a to b inclusive, it's b - a + 1. But here, a is 319 and b is 3183, so it's 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n. But wait, let me make sure that n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, n = 319, 320, ..., 3183. The number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me verify: 3183 - 319 = 2864, so 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, that's 2865 x-intercepts. But wait, let me think again. Is x = 1/(n\u03c0) strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001? So, when n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.97) \u2248 0.000996, which is less than 0.001, right? And when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) = 0.0001. Wait, but the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, x = 1/(n\u03c0) must satisfy 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so n can be up to 3183, but since it's strictly less than 0.001, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, so n starts at 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but let me check if 3183\u03c0 is exactly 10000, but \u03c0 is irrational, so 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10000.0, but not exactly. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but just slightly less. Since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001, so n must be less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so n can be up to 3183 because 3183 < 3183.09886184. Similarly, n must be greater than 318.30988618, so the smallest integer n is 319. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, giving 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 x-intercepts. Wait, but let me check if 1/(3183\u03c0) is indeed greater than 0.0001. Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0): 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute that: 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, and 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 574.642. So, total is approximately 9424.77796 + 574.642 \u2248 10,000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since \u03c0 is a bit more than 3.1415926535, 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001. But our interval is x > 0.0001, so x must be greater than 0.0001, which means 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, so n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n can be up to 3183 because 3183 < 3183.09886184, meaning 1/(3183\u03c0) > 0.0001? Wait, no, because if n is smaller, 1/(n\u03c0) is larger. So, if n = 3183, 1/(n\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but slightly less because n\u03c0 is slightly more than 10,000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, which would place x = 1/(3183\u03c0) just below 0.0001, which is outside the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's not included in the interval. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Wait, let me check that. Let me compute 1/(3182\u03c0): 3182\u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's see, 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 182\u03c0 \u2248 571.724, so total \u2248 9424.77796 + 571.724 \u2248 10,000 - approximately 10,000 - let me compute more accurately. 3182 * \u03c0: Let me compute 3182 * 3.1415926535.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, so n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but as we saw, 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001, which is outside the interval. Therefore, the maximum n such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n = 3183 - 1 = 3182. Let me verify: 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000 - some small amount), so it's slightly greater than 0.0001. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. Similarly, the minimum n is 319 because n must be greater than 318.30988618, so n starts at 319. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 gives 2864. Wait, that's different from before. Hmm, so I think I made a mistake earlier by including n=3183, which gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so n must be less than 3183.09886184, so n can be up to 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. Wait, let me check that again. If n starts at 319 and ends at 3182, inclusive, then the number of terms is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863, then +1 gives 2864. So, 2864 x-intercepts. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but that was including n=3183, which is excluded. So, correct number is 2864. Hmm, but let me make sure. Let's take a small example to verify. Suppose I have n from 2 to 5 inclusive. That's 2,3,4,5: 4 numbers. 5 - 2 +1 = 4. So, correct. So, in our case, from 319 to 3182 inclusive, number of terms is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864. So, the answer should be 2864 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I have 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, so n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n can be up to 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182, which is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute the number of zeros by considering how many times the sine function oscillates as x approaches zero. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly as x approaches zero. Each oscillation corresponds to a peak and a trough, and between each peak and trough, there's a zero crossing. So, in the interval (a, b), the number of zeros is approximately the number of times 1/x passes through multiples of \u03c0 as x moves from b to a. Since x is in (0.0001, 0.001), 1/x is in (1000, 10000). So, the number of zeros is the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. So, the number of zeros is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0). Let me compute that. 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, so ceil(1000/\u03c0) = 319. 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so floor(10000/\u03c0) = 3183. Therefore, the number of zeros is 3183 - 319 +1? Wait, no, because floor(10000/\u03c0) is 3183, and ceil(1000/\u03c0) is 319, so the number of integers n where 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183 is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2864 because n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again. The zeros occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) where n is a positive integer. We need x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities): 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, the smallest n is 319, and the largest n is 3183, because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.0, but slightly more, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but just below. Since x must be greater than 0.0001, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so n can be up to 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182, inclusive. So, the number of terms is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864. So, the correct number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but in the other approach, using floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0) +1, which would be 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865, but that includes n=3183, which is excluded. So, perhaps the correct formula is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0). So, 3183 - 319 = 2864. So, that matches the earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better way is to compute the number of zeros as the difference between the upper and lower bounds divided by \u03c0, and take the integer parts. But in any case, I think the correct number is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me double-check with an example. Suppose I have an interval (a, b), and I want to find the number of n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (a, b). Then, the number of such n is floor(1/a /\u03c0) - ceil(1/b /\u03c0). Wait, no, let's see. Wait, 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, for x in (a, b), 1/(n\u03c0) must be in (a, b), so n must satisfy 1/(b) < n\u03c0 < 1/a. So, n must be in (1/(b\u03c0), 1/(a\u03c0)). So, the number of integers n in that interval is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) +1, if the interval is inclusive. But since our interval is open, (a, b), we have to be careful.\n\nIn our case, a = 0.0001, b = 0.001. So, 1/a = 10000, 1/b = 1000. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so n must be in (1000/\u03c0, 10000/\u03c0). So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, the number of integers n is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0). So, floor(3183.09886184) = 3183, ceil(318.30988618) = 319. So, number of integers is 3183 - 319 = 2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer. So, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2864 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing by \u03c0 gives 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. The integers n range from 319 to 3182, inclusive. The number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\n$\\boxed{2864}$"

Calculating 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Now, divide all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.3098861. Similarly, 10000 / \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.098861. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.3098861 and less than approximately 3183.098861. Since n has to be an integer, n can take integer values from the next integer after 318.3098861, which is 319, up to the integer part of 3183.098861, which is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then add 1 to include both endpoints. Wait, actually, it's (3183 - 319) + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then 2864 + 1 is 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the given interval. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the range again. The lower bound was 0.0001, which is 10^-4, and the upper bound was 0.001, which is 10^-3. So, 1/x must be between 1000 and 10000, which is correct. So, 1/(n\u03c0) is between 1000 and 10000, so n is between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which I calculated correctly. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that seems correct.

    "text": " Let's take reciprocals, but remembering that reversing the inequalities when taking reciprocals. So, starting with 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0), taking reciprocals gives n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. 1/0.0001 is 10000, so n\u03c0 < 10000. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies that n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, putting it together: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000/\u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618 and less than approximately 3183.0988618.

So, n can take integer values from 319 to 3183, inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1. Wait, let me think. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that. 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me double-check the range for n. So, x must be between 0.0001 and 0.001, so 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. Then, 1/x = n\u03c0, so n = (1/x)/\u03c0. So, when x is 0.0001, 1/x is 10000, so n = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. When x is 0.001, 1/x is 1000, so n = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than 318.30988618 and less than 3183.0988618. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the function y = sin(1/x) crosses the x-axis 2865 times between 0.0001 and 0.001.

Taking reciprocals on both sides (and remembering that flipping inequalities when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive), we get: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Calculating 1/0.0001, that's 10000. So, 10000 > n\u03c0, which implies n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute 10000 divided by \u03c0. Since \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n is an integer, n \u2264 3183.\n\nNow, the right inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals again, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618. Since n must be an integer, n \u2265 319.\n\nWait, let me check that. 1000/\u03c0 is approximately 318.30988618, so the next integer greater than that is 319. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183, inclusive. So, the integers n are from 319 to 3183. Now, to find how many integers are in this range, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then add 1 (since both endpoints are inclusive). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think: the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 3183.0988618, so n \u2264 3183. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n > 318.30988618, so n \u2265 319. So, n runs from 319 to 3183, which gives 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Yeah, that seems right. I think that's the answer. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me check with n=319 and n=3183. For n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.08) \u2248 0.000998, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. For n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.000...) which is approximately 0.0001, but since x has to be greater than 0.0001, does 1/(3183\u03c0) equal exactly 0.0001? Let me compute 3183\u03c0: 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 10000.000000000... So, 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, but our interval is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001. So, does that mean n=3183 is excluded? Wait, that's a good point. Because x has to be greater than 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than that, meaning n can be up to 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is not included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 would give x=0.0001, which is not in the interval. So, actually, n should be less than 3183.0988618, so n \u2264 3183, but since 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded, n can only go up to 3182. So, let's adjust that. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3182. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Hmm, that's one less than before. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by including n=3183, which gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the correct count is 2864.\n\nWait, let me confirm this. Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0): 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 10000.000000000... So, 1/(3183\u03c0) = 0.0001 exactly. Since our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so x=0.0001 is not included. Therefore, n=3183 is excluded, so the maximum n is 3182. So, n runs from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that again: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, the correct number is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check for n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000 - \u03c0) \u2248 approximately 0.0001000000... something, which is just slightly above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. So, n=3182 is valid, but n=3183 is not. So, the count is 2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the subtraction. 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then minus 19 is 2863. Then 2863 + 1 is 2864. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the number of integers between a and b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a=319, b=3182. So, 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me check with n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.08) \u2248 0.0009979, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. And n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000 - something) \u2248 0.0001000..., which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. So, yes, from n=319 to n=3182, that's 2864 integers. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but after realizing that n=3183 is excluded, it's 2864. So, that's the correct answer.\n\nI think that's solid now. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

    "text": " Let me take reciprocals, but I have to remember that taking reciprocals reverses the inequalities. So, if I take reciprocals of 0.0001 and 0.001, I get 10000 and 100000. But since I'm taking reciprocals, the inequalities flip. So, 1/(0.0001) > n\u03c0 > 1/(0.001). Wait, that's not correct because when I take reciprocals, the direction changes. Let me think again. If 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, then taking reciprocals (and flipping inequalities) gives: 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those, 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Now, dividing all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n can take integer values from the next integer after 318.309886184, which is 319, up to the integer before 3183.09886184, which is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, let me check that. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n in that range. Each of these n corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2865. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check the range of n. 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so the smallest integer n is 319. Similarly, n must be less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so the largest integer n is 3183. So, the count is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, I should also consider whether x = 1/(n\u03c0) is strictly within (0.0001, 0.001). Let me check the endpoints. For n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.09886184) \u2248 0.00099698, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's within the interval. For n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.09886184) \u2248 0.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's just below the lower bound. Wait, that can't be right because 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.000099999, which is 9.9999e-5, which is less than 0.0001 (which is 1e-4). So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is actually less than 0.0001, so it's not included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, that means n = 3183 gives x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. Therefore, the largest n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n where 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, solving for n, n < 1/(0.0001 * \u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but as we saw, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the maximum n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n where 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which is n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, the maximum integer n is 3183, but since x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, we need to check if n=3183 gives x > 0.0001. Wait, no, because 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so n=3183 is too big. So, the next lower n is 3182. Let's check n=3182: x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000 - some small amount) \u2248 approximately 0.000100000... Wait, let me compute it more accurately. 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 182\u03c0 \u2248 572.01658, so total \u2248 9424.77796 + 572.01658 \u2248 10, 000. So, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 10,000 - let me check: 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000.09886, so 3182\u03c0 \u2248 10,000.09886 - \u03c0 \u2248 10,000.09886 - 3.1415926535 \u2248 9996.957267. So, x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.957267 \u2248 0.0001000305. Which is approximately 0.0001000305, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. Therefore, n=3182 gives x \u2248 0.0001000305, which is within (0.0001, 0.001). So, the maximum n is 3182, not 3183. Wait, that changes things. So, earlier I thought n goes up to 3183, but actually, n=3183 gives x less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, the maximum n is 3182. So, now, let's adjust the range of n. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, there are 2864 x-intercepts. Wait, but earlier I thought n=3183 gives x just below 0.0001, so it's excluded, so the maximum n is 3182. So, the count is from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. Let me confirm this calculation: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. But wait, earlier I had 2865, but after correcting for n=3183 being excluded, it's 2864. Hmm, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial calculation. Let's recast the problem.\n\nWe have x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, 0.0001 < x < 0.001. We have x = 1/(n\u03c0), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals and flipping inequalities: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. Therefore, n can be from 319 up to 3183, but wait, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, as we saw earlier. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182*3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000 - 4\u03c0) \u2248 approximately 0.00010003, which is indeed greater than 0.0001, so it's included. So, n=3182 is included, but n=3183 is excluded. So, the count is from 319 to 3182, which is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought 3183 was included, but upon closer inspection, it's not. So, the correct count is 2864. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact values to confirm.\n\nLet me compute 1/(3182\u03c0):\n\n\u03c0 \u2248 3.141592653589793\n\n3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.141592653589793 \u2248 let's compute step by step:\n\n3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796076938\n\n182 * \u03c0 \u2248 572.0165812582968\n\nAdding them: 9424.77796076938 + 572.0165812582968 \u2248 10,000.000000027677\n\nWait, that can't be right because 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.141592653589793.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute 3182 * \u03c0 more accurately.\n\nLet me compute 3182 * 3.141592653589793.\n\nFirst, 3000 * 3.141592653589793 = 9424.777960769379\n\nThen, 182 * 3.141592653589793:\n\n180 * 3.141592653589793 = 565.4866776461627\n\n2 * 3.141592653589793 = 6.283185307179586\n\nAdding them: 565.4866776461627 + 6.283185307179586 \u2248 571.7698629533423\n\nNow, adding 9424.777960769379 + 571.7698629533423 \u2248 9996.547823722721\n\nSo, 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 9996.547823722721\n\nTherefore, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.547823722721 \u2248 0.0001000340272\n\nWhich is approximately 0.000100034, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval.\n\nNow, let's check n=3183:\n\n3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2248 9996.547823722721 + 3.141592653589793 \u2248 10,000.000000027677\n\nSo, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10,000.000000027677 \u2248 0.0000999999972, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded.\n\nTherefore, the maximum n is 3182, and the minimum n is 319.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not missing any intercepts near the upper bound of the interval, which is 0.001. So, x must be less than 0.001, so 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which implies n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so n starts at 319. So, the lower bound is correctly handled, and the upper bound is handled by n \u2264 3182, as we saw.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nBut wait, let me check again: 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\n3182 - 319 = 2863\n\n2863 + 1 = 2864.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 3183 was excluded, so the count is 2864. So, that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\). This occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for some integer \\( n \\), which implies \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n\nWe need \\( x \\) to be in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\). Therefore, we solve the inequality:\n\\[ 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\]\n\nTaking reciprocals and flipping the inequalities, we get:\n\\[ 1000 < n\\pi < 10000 \\]\n\nDividing by \\( \\pi \\) (approximately 3.1415926535), we find:\n\\[ \\frac{1000}{\\pi} < n < \\frac{10000}{\\pi} \\]\n\nCalculating these values:\n\\[ \\frac{1000}{\\pi} \\approx 318.309886184 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{10000}{\\pi} \\approx 3183.09886184 \\]\n\nThus, \\( n \\) must be an integer between 319 and 3182 inclusive. The number of integers in this range is:\n\\[ 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\) is \\(\\boxed{2864}\\)."

    "text": " Let's take the reciprocals, remembering that flipping the inequalities because all terms are positive. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001 Calculating 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Now, divide all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. Now, since n has to be an integer, n must satisfy 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184. So, n can take integer values starting from the next integer after 318.309..., which is 319, up to the integer just below 3183.098..., which is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are inclusive). So, number of terms = 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 integer values of n, each corresponding to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0) within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, starting from x = 1/(n\u03c0), and x is between 0.0001 and 0.001. Taking reciprocals correctly flips the inequalities because all numbers are positive, so that gives 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing by \u03c0 gives approximately 318.31 < n < 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The count is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. That seems correct. Hmm, but wait, sometimes when counting inclusive ranges, it's easy to make an off-by-one error. Let me check with smaller numbers. Suppose I have integers from 2 to 5. That's 2,3,4,5. So, 5 - 2 + 1 = 4 numbers, which is correct. So applying that here, 3183 - 319 +1 is indeed 2865. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: The number of integers between a and b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319, b is 3183, so 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Yep, that seems right.\n\nI can also think about the interval (0.0001, 0.001) in terms of 1/x. When x is 0.0001, 1/x is 10000, and when x is 0.001, 1/x is 1000. So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000 as x goes from 0.001 to 0.0001. Wait, no, when x increases, 1/x decreases. So, as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000. So, the function sin(1/x) oscillates between -1 and 1 as 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000. Each time 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0, we get a zero crossing. So, the number of zero crossings is the number of multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. But wait, actually, when 1/x is decreasing, it's going from 10000 down to 1000, so the zeros occur at n\u03c0 where n is an integer such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n is from 319 to 3183, as I found earlier. So, that's consistent.\n\nWait, another thought: The function sin(1/x) has an infinite number of oscillations as x approaches 0, but in this case, x is bounded away from 0 by 0.0001, so we're looking at a finite interval where the oscillations are still very rapid but finite. So, the number of zeros should be finite, which it is: 2865. That makes sense.\n\nI think I'm confident that the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0. Solving for x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) gives x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n from 319 to 3183, resulting in 2865 intercepts.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify x-intercepts**: Set y = 0, so sin(1/x) = 0.\n2. **Solve for x**: sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 = n\u03c0, thus 1/x = n\u03c0 \u2192 x = 1/(n\u03c0).\n3. **Determine range for x**: x must satisfy 0.0001 < x < 0.001.\n4. **Substitute x = 1/(n\u03c0)**: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n5. **Find n bounds**: Reciprocate and divide by \u03c0 to get 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000 \u2192 318.31 < n < 3183.098.\n6. **Count integers n**: n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 intercepts.\n\nAnswer: The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."
