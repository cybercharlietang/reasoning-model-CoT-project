Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in determining the range of n. When x is 0.001, 1/x is 1000, so 1000 = n\u03c0 implies n \u2248 318.309, which is correct. Similarly, when x is 0.0001, 1/x is 10000, so 10000 = n\u03c0 implies n \u2248 3183.098, which is also correct. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. Thus, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.

    "text": " So, there are 2865 integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but I should double-check if the endpoints are included correctly. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. So, I need to ensure that 1/(n\u03c0) is strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. So, n must be strictly less than 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183 because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000.0008, which is just over 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, n must be less than 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0): 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000.0008, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is just below 0.0001, so x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included in the interval. Therefore, the largest n such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n = 3183 because 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999 < 0.0001, so n must be less than 3183.098, so the largest integer n is 3183, but wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so to have x > 0.0001, n must be less than 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but since 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. So, the smallest x in the interval is just above 0.0001, which corresponds to n just below 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so to get x > 0.0001, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183. Wait, but if n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3182. Let's check: 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182*3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000 - some). Let me compute 3182 * \u03c0: 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 (3183 -1)*\u03c0 \u2248 10000.0008 - \u03c0 \u2248 10000.0008 - 3.1416 \u2248 9996.8592. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.8592 \u2248 0.00010003, which is just over 0.0001, so x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.00010003, which is in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n can go up to 3182. Similarly, the lower bound: n must be greater than 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Now, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 is 2864. So, there are 2864 integers n in this range, meaning 2864 x-intercepts. Wait, earlier I thought it was 2865, but now I'm getting 2864. Let me check again. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, from 319 to 3182: 3182 - 319 = 2863, +1 = 2864. So, 2864 x-intercepts. Therefore, the correct number is 2864. I think earlier I mistakenly included n=3183, but since x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, it's not included. So, the correct count is 2864. Let me just verify with an example. Suppose n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22481/(1003.22)\u22480.0009968, which is within (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.00010003, which is just above 0.0001. So, both ends are included correctly.

Let me check for n=319: x = 1/(319 * \u03c0) \u2248 1/(319 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(1003.13) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001 but greater than 0.0001, so that's okay. For n=3183: x = 1/(3183 * \u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000.05) \u2248 0.00009999, which is just less than 0.0001, but wait, our interval starts at 0.0001, so x needs to be greater than 0.0001. Wait, so n=3183 gives x \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside our interval. Hmm, so that means n=3183 is actually too low because x would be less than 0.0001. So, perhaps my upper bound for n was too high. Let me recast this. So, the condition is x > 0.0001, which is 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, solving for n: n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so n must be less than 3183.098, meaning the maximum integer n is 3183. But when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so that's outside our interval. So, actually, n must be less than or equal to 3182 because when n=3182, x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182*3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000.05 - 3.1416) \u2248 roughly 1/9997, which is approximately 0.00010003, which is just over 0.0001. So, n=3182 gives x\u22480.00010003, which is in the interval, and n=3183 gives x\u22480.00009999, which is just below 0.0001, so outside. Therefore, n can go up to 3182. Similarly, for the lower bound, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319, as before. So, now, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the count is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but let me confirm that when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.13) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. And when n=3182, x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000 - something), which is approximately 0.00010003, which is just above 0.0001, so that's within the interval. So, n runs from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. 3182 - 319 is 2863, plus 1 is 2864. Alternatively, I can think of it as the number of integers between a and b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, from 319 to 3182, that's 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864. So, that's the answer.

Taking reciprocals (and remembering that reversing the inequalities because reciprocals flip the order for positive numbers): 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing all parts by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 and less than 10000/\u03c0. Calculating those: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1, so 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but I should check if x = 1/(n\u03c0) is actually within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, for n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.82) \u2248 0.000997, which is approximately 0.001, but just a bit less, so 0.000997 is indeed greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. Similarly, for n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, which is exactly 0.0001, but since the interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), we don't include the endpoints. Wait, so does that mean that n = 3183 gives x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but since the interval is open, it's not included. So, actually, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is not included in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, perhaps the maximum n is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) would be slightly larger than 0.0001. Let me check: 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 3182 * 3 = 9546, 3182 * 0.1416 \u2248 3182 * 0.1 = 318.2, 3182 * 0.0416 \u2248 131.9, so total \u2248 9546 + 318.2 + 131.9 \u2248 9996.1. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.1 \u2248 0.00010004, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. Similarly, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.1416 \u2248 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.0416 \u2248 132.2, so total \u2248 9549 + 318.3 + 132.2 \u2248 9999.5. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.5 \u2248 0.000100005, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. Wait, but 0.0001 is 10^{-4}, and 0.000100005 is just a tiny bit more, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n can go up to 3183. Similarly, for n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.82) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so included. Wait, but 0.000997 is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, both n=319 and n=3183 give x within the interval. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that should be correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't miss any cases. So, each n from 319 to 3183 gives a unique x in (0.0001, 0.001) where sin(1/x) = 0. So, each of these x's is an intercept. Therefore, the total number is 2865. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

However, since x = 1/(n\u03c0), and n is an integer, we need to ensure that 1/(n\u03c0) is strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. So, n must satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183 because 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is just below 0.0001. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309, so n must be at least 319, since 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009969, which is just below 0.001. So, yes, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 2865 intercepts. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). For x in (0.0001, 0.001), n ranges from 319 to 3183, yielding 2865 intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

Wait, but let me double-check if I included all possible n correctly. Let me consider n starting at 319 and ending at 3183. So, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319. 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more is 2864, so yes, 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, another way to compute the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that should be the number of x-intercepts. Wait, but let me think again: when x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. So, as x gets smaller, the function oscillates faster, leading to more zeros in a given interval. Here, our interval is from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is a very small interval near zero. So, the number of zeros should be quite large, which aligns with 2865. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, just to confirm. Alternatively, I can consider the function 1/x as it relates to the sine function. The zeros of sin(1/x) occur at 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, each x-intercept is at x = 1/(n\u03c0). Now, I need to find all n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let's solve for n in both inequalities. Starting with 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. Multiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 > 0.0001 * n\u03c0. Then, divide both sides by 0.0001\u03c0: 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) > n. Which is the same as n < 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n \u2264 3183.\n\nSimilarly, for the upper inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Multiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0. Then, divide both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n \u2265 319.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.

Let me compute 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of periods of sin(1/x) in the interval.

Yes, it's 0.0009974, which is about 0.001, but just a bit less. Wait, 0.0009974 is actually less than 0.001, right? Because 0.001 is 1/1000, and 1/1002.58 is slightly less than 1/1000. So, 0.0009974 is approximately 0.000997, which is just under 0.001. So, 0.000997 is less than 0.001, so x = 1/(319\u03c0) is just under 0.001, so it's within the interval.

So, does n = 3183 give x = 1/(3183\u03c0) which is approximately 0.0001, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), x must be greater than 0.0001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so n must be less than that. So, the maximum integer n is 3183, but when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is exactly at the lower bound. Since the interval is open, we don't include x = 0.0001, so n can't be 3183 because that would make x = 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n should be 3182. Let me recalculate the range. So, n must satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, the maximum n is 3183, but as we saw, that gives x = 0.0001, which is not included. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. Similarly, let's check n = 3182: x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000 - \u03c0) \u2248 1/(9996.96) \u2248 0.00010003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. Hmm, I must have made a mistake earlier by including n=3183, which actually gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. So, the correct count is 2864.

Alternatively, I can think of it as the number of integers between 319 and 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 318 = 2864. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Let me think again. The formula is correct: upper - lower + 1. So, 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 gives 2864. So, the correct number is 2864. Alternatively, I can think of it as n starting at 319 and ending at 3182.

Then, I substituted into the interval: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n, I got 318.309 < n < 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Hmm, 3183 - 319 is indeed 2864, so adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct. I don't think I made a mistake here, but let me just confirm by checking a smaller interval to see if the method works. Suppose I take a smaller interval, say (0.0002, 0.0003). Then, 1/(n\u03c0) would be between 0.0002 and 0.0003.

So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 exactly. Therefore, since our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, we exclude x=0.0001, so n cannot be 3183 because that would give x=0.0001, which is not included. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. Let me check n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182*3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000 - 3.1416) \u2248 approximately 0.0001 + a tiny bit more. Wait, actually, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 3183\u03c0 - \u03c0 \u2248 10,000 - 3.1416 \u2248 9996.8584, so 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.8584 \u2248 0.00010003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. Similarly, n=3183 gives x=0.0001 exactly, which is excluded. So, the maximum n is 3182. Similarly, the minimum n is 319, as before, because n=318 gives x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.0) = 0.001 exactly, which is the upper bound, but since the interval is open, we exclude x=0.001. So, n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.0) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 gives 2864. Wait, that's different from before. So, earlier I thought n went up to 3183, but now I realize that n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so n must go up to 3182. Similarly, n=318 gives x=0.001, which is excluded, so the minimum n is 319. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. Hmm, so I think I made a mistake earlier by including n=3183, which actually gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. So, the correct count is 2864. Wait, but let me double-check the math: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 is 2864. Yes, that's correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Let me think again: for each integer n from 319 to 3182 inclusive, we have an x-intercept at x=1/(n\u03c0), and each of these x's lies strictly between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, that should be the correct count. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 1/(n\u03c0) between these values. Solving for n gives n between approximately 319 and 3182, yielding 2864 integer values.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}."

    "text": " So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the range of n. Since x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, and x = 1/(n\u03c0), as x increases, n increases because 1/(n\u03c0) increases as n decreases. Wait, actually, as x increases, 1/x decreases, so n\u03c0 must be smaller, meaning n is smaller. Hmm, maybe I should think about it differently. Let me consider the function y = sin(1/x). As x approaches 0 from the positive side, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is very close to zero, the function oscillates a lot. Each time 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0, we get an x-intercept. So, the number of intercepts corresponds to how many times 1/x passes through n\u03c0 as x goes from 0.001 down to 0.0001. Wait, but x is moving from 0.001 to 0.0001, which is from a larger value to a smaller value, so 1/x goes from 1000 to 10000. So, 1/x increases from 1000 to 10000 as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001. So, the values of n\u03c0 must lie between 1000 and 10000. Therefore, n must satisfy 1000 \u2264 n\u03c0 \u2264 10000. So, n must be between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0. Calculating those: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Thus, the number of n's is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the number of zeros by considering the interval of 1/x. Let me let t = 1/x. Then, when x is in (0.0001, 0.001), t is in (1000, 10000). So, t ranges from 1000 to 10000. The function becomes y = sin(t), and we need to find how many times sin(t) crosses zero in t \u2208 (1000, 10000). The zeros of sin(t) occur at t = n\u03c0 for integers n. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Solving for n: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which is the same as before. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, giving 2865 zeros.

The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

    "text": " So, that suggests there are 2865 x-intercepts. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in determining the range of n. So, x is in (0.0001, 0.001), which is equivalent to (1/10000, 1/1000). So, 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 1/10000 and less than 1/1000. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 1/10000 implies n\u03c0 < 10000, so n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 1/1000 implies n\u03c0 > 1000, so n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, n must be from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that seems correct. But wait, I'm a bit concerned because the function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0, so between 0.0001 and 0.001, it's oscillating a lot. Each oscillation should cross the x-axis twice, once going up and once going down, except perhaps at the extremes. Wait, no, actually, each period of sin(1/x) is 2\u03c0/(1/x) = 2\u03c0x. Hmm, but as x decreases, the period increases. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, the period of sin(k/x) is 2\u03c0/(k/x) = 2\u03c0x/k. So, in our case, k=1, so the period is 2\u03c0x. So, as x decreases, the period increases, meaning the function oscillates more slowly as x approaches zero. But in our interval, x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, so as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, the period decreases from 2\u03c0*0.0001 \u2248 0.000628 to 2\u03c0*0.001 \u2248 0.00628. Wait, so as x increases, the period decreases, meaning more oscillations as x increases. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that affects the count of zeros. Wait, each zero crossing occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0), so each n corresponds to a zero crossing. So, for each n from 319 to 3183, we have a zero crossing. So, the number of zeros is 2865. But wait, let me check with specific examples. Let me take n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.32) \u2248 0.0009966, which is just below 0.001. Similarly, n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0003) \u2248 0.000099999, which is just above 0.0001. So, all these x values lie within (0.0001, 0.001). So, each integer n from 319 to 3183 gives a unique x-intercept in that interval. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but let me confirm that 1/(3183\u03c0) is indeed greater than 0.0001. Let's compute 1/(3183\u03c0): 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 3183 * 3 = 9549, plus 3183 * 0.1416 \u2248 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.0416 \u2248 132. So total \u2248 9549 + 318.3 + 132 \u2248 9999.3. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.3 \u2248 0.000100007, which is just above 0.0001. So, yes, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is within the interval. Similarly, for n=319: 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 1003.32, so 1/1003.32 \u2248 0.0009966, which is less than 0.001. So, both endpoints are included, so n=319 and n=3183 are valid. Therefore, the total number of zeros is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. I think that makes sense. So, the function sin(1/x) crosses the x-axis 2865 times between 0.0001 and 0.001.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. To find the number of such intercepts in (0.0001, 0.001), we determine the range of n such that 1/(n\u03c0) lies within this interval. Solving for n, we find n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive.

So, solving for n: 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0). Which is n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). I think that's the answer. Wait, but just to be thorough, let me check with specific examples. Let's take n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.58) \u2248 0.0009964, which is approximately 0.0009964, which is just below 0.001. Wait, but 0.0009964 is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Similarly, n = 318: x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1001.08) \u2248 0.0009989, which is still less than 0.001. Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, n starts at 319. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check n = 318: x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009989, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's within the interval. But according to my earlier inequality, n > 318.309, so n starts at 319. So, n=319 gives x \u2248 0.0009964, which is just below 0.001, and n=318 would give x \u2248 0.0009989, which is also within the interval. Wait, so maybe I made a mistake in the lower bound. Let me re-examine that. The inequality was 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which is equivalent to n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than that. But for the lower bound, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. So, n=319 is the first n where x=1/(319\u03c0) is less than 0.001. But wait, n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009989, which is still less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, perhaps my initial calculation was wrong because I took n > 318.309, so n starts at 319, but n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0) which is still less than 0.001. Wait, let's compute 1/(318\u03c0): 318 * 3.1416 \u2248 1001.08, so 1/1001.08 \u2248 0.0009989, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, does that mean that n can be 318? Wait, but 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 is equivalent to n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=319 is the first integer where x=1/(n\u03c0) is less than 0.001. But wait, n=318 gives x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009989, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, perhaps my initial calculation was wrong because I thought n must be greater than 318.309, but actually, n can be 319 and above, but n=318 also gives x within the interval. Wait, no, let me think again. The inequality is 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which is equivalent to n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. So, n=319 is the first n where x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009964, which is less than 0.001. But wait, n=318 gives x\u22480.0009989, which is still less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, that suggests that n=318 is acceptable, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is less than that, so it doesn't satisfy n > 318.309. Therefore, n=318 is not included. Wait, that seems contradictory because when I plug n=318, I get x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009989, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, perhaps my inequality is wrong. Let me re-examine the inequality step. So, starting with 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, we can solve for n: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n\u03c0 > 1/0.001 => n\u03c0 > 1000 => n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. Therefore, n=319 is the first n where x=1/(319\u03c0) is less than 0.001. So, n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009989, which is less than 0.001, but since n must be greater than 318.309, n=318 is not included. So, that means n starts at 319, not 318. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is from n=319 to n=3183, inclusive. So, the count is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that's correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 1/(n\u03c0) between 0.0001 and 0.001. Solving for n gives n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098.
