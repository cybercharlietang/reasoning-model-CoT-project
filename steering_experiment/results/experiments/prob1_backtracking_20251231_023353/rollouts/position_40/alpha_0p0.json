Wait a second, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from x = 1/(n\u03c0). The interval is 0.0001 < x < 0.001, so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and remembering to flip the inequalities because reciprocating positive numbers reverses the inequality): 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing each part by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating those, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct. But let me think again: when n increases, x decreases because x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, as n goes from 319 upwards, x goes from 1/(319\u03c0) down to 1/(3183\u03c0). Wait, but 1/(319\u03c0) is approximately 1/(1000. something) which is about 0.001, and 1/(3183\u03c0) is about 0.0001. So, yes, that fits within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, each n corresponds to an x in that interval, and there are 2865 such n's. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's correct.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. Let me double-check the substitution. When x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, then 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. So, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, which is when x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, to find x in (0.0001, 0.001), 1/(n\u03c0) must be between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. That's the same as 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing all parts by \u03c0, we get 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating these: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309 and less than approximately 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, which is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct. But just to make sure, let me consider n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.7) \u2248 0.000997, which is approximately 0.001, but just a bit less. Wait, but 0.000997 is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Similarly, n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.000...) which is approximately 0.0001, but just a bit more. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since the interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), does 0.0001 and 0.001 themselves count? No, because the interval doesn't include the endpoints. So, we need to make sure that 1/(n\u03c0) is strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. So, n must satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, n must be less than 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n must be less than that, so the maximum integer n is 3183. Similarly, n must be greater than 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so the minimum integer n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which gives 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.

Wait, but I should double-check if the endpoints are included. The original interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x can't be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. But since x = 1/(n\u03c0), we need to ensure that 1/(n\u03c0) is strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. So, let's check the n values at the boundaries. For n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.18) \u2248 0.0009968, which is approximately 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001, so that's good. But is it greater than 0.0001? Yes, because 0.0009968 is greater than 0.0001. Similarly, for n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.08) \u2248 0.0000999992, which is just under 0.0001. Wait, that's a problem because 0.0000999992 is less than 0.0001, so x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is actually less than 0.0001, which is outside the interval. Therefore, n = 3183 gives x outside the interval. So, the largest n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. Let me solve for n when x = 0.0001: 0.0001 = 1/(n\u03c0) => n = 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than 3183.098. Since n is an integer, the largest possible n is 3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x \u2248 0.0000999992, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the largest n such that x > 0.0001 is n = 3183 - 1 = 3182. Wait, let me check that. If n=3183 gives x \u2248 0.0000999992, which is less than 0.0001, so n=3182 gives x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000 - \u03c0) \u2248 1/(9996.86) \u2248 0.00010003, which is just over 0.0001. So, n=3182 is the largest n where x > 0.0001. Similarly, the smallest n is 319, as before. So, the range of n is from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Now, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, there are 2864 x-intercepts. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, where did I go wrong? It seems that n=3183 gives x just below 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the upper bound is n=3182, and the lower bound is n=319. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. So, the correct number is 2864. Let me double-check this calculation. 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863. Then, adding 1 gives 2864. So, yes, 2864. Alternatively, I can think of it as the number of integers between a and b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a=319, b=3182. So, 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Therefore, the final answer is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, leading to x = 1/(n\u03c0). Within the interval (0.0001, 0.001), n ranges from 319 to 3182, resulting in 2864 x-intercepts.\n\n\\boxed{2864}"

Each oscillation corresponds to a zero crossing when 1/x increases by \u03c0. So, the zeros occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0), and between 0.0001 and 0.001, n ranges from 319 to 3183.

So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the range of n. So, x = 1/(n\u03c0) must be between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, for n starting at 319, x would be 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.0) \u2248 0.000997, which is just under 0.001, so that's good. For n = 318, x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.0) \u2248 0.001, but since our interval is up to 0.001 exclusive, n=318 would give x=0.001, which is not included. So, n starts at 319. Similarly, for n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000318, which is less than 0.0001, so that's not included either. Wait, hold on, that seems contradictory. Because earlier, I thought n=3183 gives x\u22480.0000318, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not in the interval. But wait, I thought n=3183 was the upper limit. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation.\n\nLet me re-examine the inequalities. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, solving for n, we have:\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001: n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098.\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001: n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309.\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098.\n\nSo, n can be from 319 up to 3183, but wait, 3183 is less than 3183.098, so n can be 3183.\n\nWait, but when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000318, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. So, that can't be right. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the upper bound.\n\nWait, no, because 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001, so n must be less than 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n can be up to 3183 because 3183 < 3183.098, but when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000318, which is less than 0.0001, so that's not in the interval. So, maybe the upper bound is actually lower.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me solve for n in the inequality 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nFirst, for the lower bound: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098.\n\nFor the upper bound: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309.\n\nSo, n must be an integer between 319 and 3183, inclusive.\n\nBut wait, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000318, which is less than 0.0001, so that's outside the interval. So, actually, the maximum n for which x=1/(n\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001 is when 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n can be up to 3183, but when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000318, which is less than 0.0001, so that's not in the interval. Therefore, the maximum n for which x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is actually n=3183, but since x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, that's not included. So, perhaps the maximum n is 3183-1=3182?\n\nWait, let's compute x when n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001. But since \u03c0\u22483.1416, 3183*3.1416\u224810000. So, x\u22480.0001. But our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001, not equal. So, n must be such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, so n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u22483183.098. So, n can be up to 3183, but when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is not included. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because when n=3182, x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.0001003, which is just above 0.0001.\n\nSimilarly, for the lower end, when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.000997, which is just below 0.001, so that's included.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 is 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 gives 2864.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier calculation. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier by including n=3183, which actually gives x less than 0.0001, so it's excluded.\n\nSo, let's recalculate:\n\nn starts at 319, ends at 3182.\n\nNumber of terms is 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\nCompute 3182 - 319:\n\n3182 - 300 = 2882\n\n2882 - 19 = 2863\n\nThen, 2863 + 1 = 2864.\n\nSo, there are 2864 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with specific values.\n\nWhen n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22481/(1003.0)\u22480.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nWhen n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22481/(10000 - \u03c0)\u22481/9996.95\u22480.00010003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nWhen n=3183: x\u22480.00009997, which is less than 0.0001, so excluded.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nSo, number of terms is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but now I'm getting 2864. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let's compute 3182 - 319:\n\n3182 - 300 = 2882\n\n2882 - 19 = 2863\n\nThen, 2863 +1=2864.\n\nYes, so 2864.\n\nWait, but another way: the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a +1.\n\nSo, 3182 -319 +1= 3182 -319=2863, +1=2864.\n\nYes, so 2864.\n\nBut earlier I thought it was 2865 because I included n=3183, which is incorrect.\n\nSo, the correct number is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with n=319: 319, 320,...,3182.\n\nThe number of terms is 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought 3183 was included, but now I see it's excluded. So, the correct count is 2864.\n\nBut let me think again: when n=319, x\u22480.000997, which is just under 0.001, so included.\n\nn=3182: x\u22480.00010003, just over 0.0001, included.\n\nn=3183: x\u22480.00009997, less than 0.0001, excluded.\n\nSo, n goes up to 3182.\n\nThus, number of intercepts is 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial substitution.\n\nWe have y = sin(1/x). The zeros occur at 1/x = n\u03c0, so x=1/(n\u03c0).\n\nWe need x in (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nSo, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nWhich implies 1/(0.001) > n\u03c0 >1/(0.0001)\n\nSo, 1000 >n\u03c0>10000.\n\nDividing by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248318.309 <n<10000/\u03c0\u22483183.098.\n\nSo, n must be integer from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nWait, but when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00009997, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded.\n\nTherefore, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so n must be up to 3182.\n\nSo, n=319 to n=3182 inclusive.\n\nNumber of integers: 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, the function sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. The number of oscillations increases as x gets closer to 0.\n\nIn the interval (0.0001, 0.001), we can think of how many times the function crosses the x-axis.\n\nEach crossing corresponds to a zero of sin(1/x), which happens when 1/x = n\u03c0, so x=1/(n\u03c0).\n\nSo, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) lies in (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nSo, 0.0001 <1/(n\u03c0) <0.001.\n\nWhich implies:\n\n1/(0.001) <n\u03c0<1/(0.0001)\n\nSo, 1000 <n\u03c0<10000\n\nDivide by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 <n<10000/\u03c0\n\nWhich is approximately:\n\n318.309 <n<3183.098\n\nSo, n can be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nBut when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00009997, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded.\n\nThus, n goes up to 3182.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers is 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with specific numbers:\n\nIf n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.000997, which is in (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nn=3182, x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.00010003, which is just above 0.0001, so included.\n\nn=3183, x\u22480.00009997, which is below 0.0001, so excluded.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nNumber of terms: 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but now I see it's 2864.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the bounds. Let me verify the initial inequalities. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let's solve for n again. Starting with 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0), which gives n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183.

So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the range of n. Let me double-check the inequalities. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n:\n\nFirst inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886\n\nSecond inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.309886 and less than 3183.09886. Since n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\n2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 2865 x-intercepts. Hmm, but wait a second, I'm a bit concerned because the function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0, so between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a small interval near zero, the function should have a lot of oscillations. Let me see if 2865 is a reasonable number. Let me compute the approximate number of oscillations between x = 0.0001 and x = 0.001. The function sin(1/x) completes a period every 2\u03c0 change in 1/x. So, the number of periods between x1 = 0.0001 and x2 = 0.001 is (1/x1 - 1/x2)/(2\u03c0). Let me compute that:\n\n1/x1 = 1/0.0001 = 10000\n\n1/x2 = 1/0.001 = 1000\n\nSo, the difference is 10000 - 1000 = 9000\n\nDivide by 2\u03c0: 9000 / (2\u03c0) \u2248 9000 / 6.283 \u2248 1432.39\n\nSo, approximately 1432.39 periods. Each period has two x-intercepts (since sin goes from 0 up, down, and back to 0). Wait, but actually, each period of sin(\u03b8) has two zeros: one at the start and one in the middle? Wait, no, actually, each period of sin(\u03b8) has two zeros: at \u03b8 = 0, \u03c0, 2\u03c0, etc. So, between \u03b8 = a and \u03b8 = b, the number of zeros would be roughly (b - a)/\u03c0, because each zero occurs every \u03c0 interval. Wait, that might be a better way to think about it.\n\nWait, let me think again. The function sin(\u03b8) crosses zero at \u03b8 = n\u03c0, where n is an integer. So, between \u03b8 = a and \u03b8 = b, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that a < n\u03c0 < b. So, the count would be floor(b/\u03c0) - ceil(a/\u03c0) + 1, perhaps. But in our case, \u03b8 = 1/x, so when x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, \u03b8 decreases from 10000 to 1000. Wait, that's important. So, as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, \u03b8 = 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000. So, the interval for \u03b8 is (1000, 10000). So, the number of zeros of sin(\u03b8) in \u03b8 \u2208 (1000, 10000) is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, solving for n:\n\nn > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886\n\nn < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, as before. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865, which matches my earlier calculation. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, the number of zeros is the number of times \u03b8 crosses a multiple of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. The number of such multiples is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0) + 1. Let me compute floor(10000/\u03c0): 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886, so floor is 3183. ceil(1000/\u03c0): 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.309886, so ceil is 319. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that confirms it again. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n.

So, 1/(1002.1704) \u2248 0.0009978, which is approximately 0.0009978, which is less than 0.001, but greater than 0.0001. Wait, but 0.0009978 is actually less than 0.001, but greater than 0.0001. So, x = 1/(319\u03c0) is indeed within (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, for n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0).

But wait, in this case, we're looking for zeros, which occur every \u03c0 interval in the argument of the sine function. So, each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, we get another zero. So, the number of zeros should be roughly the change in 1/x divided by \u03c0. Let me see: 1/x at x=0.001 is 1000, and at x=0.0001 is 10000. So, the difference is 10000 - 1000 = 9000.

The difference is because 9000 / \u03c0 \u2248 2866.198, so the integer part is 2866. But my previous calculation gave 2865. Wait, perhaps I missed something in the counting. Let me check again.\n\nThe number of n's is from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that more carefully:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865.\n\nBut 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, which is less than 3183.098, so that's correct. Similarly, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n starts at 319.\n\nSo, the count is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. But wait, 10000 - 1000 = 9000, so 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.198. So, why is there a discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps because the endpoints are not included in the interval. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x=0.0001 and x=0.001 are not included. So, we need to check if 1/(n\u03c0) is strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001.\n\nSo, for n, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183.\n\nSimilarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n starts at 319.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nBut the approximation 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.198 suggests that there should be 2866 zeros, but since we're dealing with integers, it's either 2865 or 2866.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me compute 3183 - 319 + 1 again.\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 +1 = 2865.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct count is 2866 because when you have n starting at 319 and ending at 3183, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nBut wait, let's think differently. The number of zeros is the number of times 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0 as x goes from 0.001 to 0.0001. So, when x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001, 1/x increases from 1000 to 10000. So, the number of zeros is the number of times 1/x passes through n\u03c0, where n is an integer from 1 upwards.\n\nThe number of zeros would be the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nCalculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098.\n\nSo, n can be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nThe number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1.\n\nSo, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think about it differently. The interval for 1/x is from 1000 to 10000, so the length is 9000. Each zero occurs every \u03c0 units, so the number of zeros is approximately 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.198, which is about 2866 zeros. But since we're dealing with exact counts, it's 2865 because the upper bound is exclusive in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, no, the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. So, 1/x cannot be exactly 10000 or 1000. So, n cannot be 3183.098 or 318.309, but since n must be integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, giving 2865 zeros.\n\nWait, but 10000/\u03c0 is approximately 3183.098, so n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009994, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. Wait, no, 0.00009994 is less than 0.0001, which is 0.0001. So, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, which is the lower bound of the interval. So, that x is not included in (0.0001, 0.001). So, the maximum n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the maximum n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3183, but since x=1/(3183\u03c0) < 0.0001, that n is not valid. So, the maximum n is actually the largest integer n where 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which is n=3183, but as we saw, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009994 < 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n where x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182*3.1416) \u2248 1/10000 \u2248 0.0001, but actually, let me compute it more accurately.\n\nCompute 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's compute 3000*3.1416=9424.8, 182*3.1416\u2248182*3=546, 182*0.1416\u224825.8552, so total \u2248546 +25.8552\u2248571.8552, so total \u22489424.8 +571.8552\u224810, so 9424.8 +571.8552\u22489996.6552. So, 3182\u03c0\u22489996.6552, so 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22481/9996.6552\u22480.000100033, which is just above 0.0001. So, x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.000100033, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n can go up to 3182, because n=3183 gives x less than 0.0001, which is excluded.\n\nSimilarly, for the lower end, n must satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which is n > 1000/\u03c0\u2248318.309, so n starts at 319.\n\nSo, now n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Let's compute the number of integers here.\n\nNumber of terms = 3182 - 319 + 1 = 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 +1 = 2864.\n\nWait, that's different from before. So, earlier I thought n went up to 3183, but actually, n=3183 gives x less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. So, number of terms is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check this again. Let me compute 3182\u03c0:\n\n3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 3000*\u03c0\u22489424.77796, 182*\u03c0\u2248571.8552. So, total\u22489424.77796 + 571.8552\u22489996.63316. So, 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22481/9996.63316\u22480.000100034, which is just above 0.0001, so included in the interval. So, n=3182 is valid.\n\nSimilarly, n=3183: 3183*\u03c0\u22483183*3.1415926535\u22483183*3\u22489549, 3183*0.1415926535\u22483183*0.1=318.3, 3183*0.0415926535\u2248132.1, so total\u2248318.3 +132.1\u2248450.4, so total\u22489549 +450.4\u22489999.4. So, 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22481/9999.4\u22480.000100006, which is just above 0.0001, but wait, 0.0001 is 1e-4, which is 0.0001. So, 0.000100006 is greater than 0.0001, so x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000100006 is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, so earlier calculation was wrong. So, n=3183 gives x\u22480.000100006, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, n can be up to 3183.\n\nWait, but let me compute 3183*\u03c0 more accurately.\n\n3183 * \u03c0:\n\nLet me compute 3183 * 3.1415926535.\n\nFirst, 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796\n\n183 * \u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 100*\u03c0\u2248314.159265, 80*\u03c0\u2248251.327412, 3*\u03c0\u22489.42477796.\n\nSo, 314.159265 + 251.327412 \u2248 565.486677, plus 9.42477796 \u2248 574.911455.\n\nSo, total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796 + 574.911455 \u2248 9999.689415.\n\nSo, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.689415 \u2248 0.000100003.\n\nSo, 0.000100003 is greater than 0.0001, so x=1/(3183\u03c0) is included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n can be up to 3183.\n\nWait, but 1/(3183\u03c0) \u22480.000100003, which is just slightly above 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, n=3183 is valid.\n\nSimilarly, n=3184: 3184\u03c0\u22483184*3.1415926535\u2248 let's compute 3000\u03c0\u22489424.77796, 184\u03c0\u2248578.05742, so total\u22489424.77796 +578.05742\u2248999, wait, 9424.77796 +578.05742\u2248999, but actually, 9424.77796 +578.05742\u224810,002.83538. So, 1/(3184\u03c0)\u22481/10002.83538\u22480.000099971, which is less than 0.0001, so excluded.\n\nTherefore, the maximum n is 3183, as 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000100003>0.0001.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nSo, number of terms is 3183 - 319 +1= 3183 -319=2864, then +1=2865.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought about the approximation, I had 9000/\u03c0\u22482866.198, which is about 2866. So, why is there a discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps because the interval is open, so we have to exclude n where x=0.0001 or x=0.001, but in our case, n=3183 gives x\u22480.000100003>0.0001, so included, and n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22481/(1003.83)\u22480.00099615, which is less than 0.001, so included.\n\nWait, let me compute 1/(319\u03c0):\n\n319\u03c0\u2248319*3.1415926535\u2248319*3=957, 319*0.1415926535\u224845.05, so total\u2248957+45.05\u22481002.05. So, 1/1002.05\u22480.000998, which is less than 0.001, so included.\n\nSo, n=319 gives x\u22480.000998, which is within (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nSimilarly, n=3183 gives x\u22480.000100003, which is just above 0.0001, so included.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 +1=2865.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but the approximation was 9000/\u03c0\u22482866.198, which is approximately 2866. So, why is the exact count 2865?\n\nI think it's because the interval is open, so we're excluding the endpoints, but in our case, the endpoints correspond to n such that x=0.0001 and x=0.001, but those x values correspond to n=10000/\u03c0\u22483183.098 and n=1000/\u03c0\u2248318.309, which are not integers, so the nearest integers are n=3183 and n=319, which give x values just inside the interval. So, the count is 2865.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0).

If x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, then 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, 1/x is in (1000, 10000). Since 1/x = n\u03c0, then n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000.

Wait a second, but I should make sure that all these x-values are indeed within the interval. Let me verify for n = 319 and n = 3183. For n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.78) \u2248 0.0009972, which is approximately 0.001, but wait, 0.0009972 is less than 0.001, so it's within the upper bound. Wait, actually, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.78) \u2248 0.0009972, which is 0.0009972, which is just below 0.001, so it's within the interval. For n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) \u2248 0.0001, but wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 1/(10000) \u2248 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.0001, so x must be greater than 0.0001. So, does x = 1/(3183\u03c0) equal exactly 0.0001? Let's check: 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001 exactly, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at both ends, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, x = 0.0001 is excluded, and x = 0.001 is excluded. Therefore, when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but it's exactly 0.0001, which is not included in the interval. So, does n = 3183 correspond to x = 0.0001, which is excluded? Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0) more accurately. Let's compute 3183 * \u03c0: \u03c0 \u2248 3.1415926535, so 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, and 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 574.54684, so total \u2248 9424.77796 + 574.54684 \u2248 10000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 exactly. Therefore, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) = 0.0001, which is not included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n = 3183 gives x = 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) will be slightly greater than 0.0001. Let me check: 3182\u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535. Let's compute 3180\u03c0 \u2248 3180 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3180 * 3 = 9540, 3180 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3180 * 0.14 \u2248 445.2, so total \u2248 9540 + 445.2 \u2248 9985.2. Then, adding 2\u03c0 \u2248 6.283, so total \u2248 9985.2 + 6.283 \u2248 9991.483. So, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9991.483, so 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9991.483 \u2248 0.000100085, which is just above 0.0001, so it's within the interval. So, n can go up to 3182. Similarly, for n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.78) \u2248 0.0009972, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Now, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, that's 2864 x-intercepts. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but now I see that n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so n goes up to 3182, which gives 2864 intercepts. So, I think the correct count is 2864. Let me verify this calculation again. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, from 319 to 3182 inclusive, it's 3182 - 319 + 1. 3182 - 319 is 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, 2864 intercepts. But wait, let me check for n=319: 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009972, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. For n=3182: 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100085, which is greater than 0.0001, so included. So, yes, n=319 to n=3182, which is 2864 intercepts. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865, but since n=3183 is excluded, it's 2864. So, that's the correct count. Therefore, the answer is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0, leading to x = 1/(n\u03c0).

However, since x must be greater than 0.0001, n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. Thus, n ranges from 319 to 3182.\n4.

So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that makes sense, but let me just double-check. The interval for x is from 0.0001 to 0.001. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly as x approaches 0. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is very close to zero, the function will oscillate a huge number of times. Each oscillation corresponds to a peak and a trough, and between each peak and trough, the function crosses the x-axis. So, the number of zeros should be roughly proportional to the reciprocal of the interval's width. Let me see, the interval is from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is a width of 0.0009. But since the function's frequency increases as x decreases, the number of zeros isn't just a simple function of the interval width. Instead, each zero occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) lies between 0.0001 and 0.001. Which is exactly what I calculated.

Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. So, when x is in (0.0001, 0.001), 1/x is in (1000, 10000). So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000.

But wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate the bounds for n. Starting with x = 1/(n\u03c0) in (0.0001, 0.001). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me solve for n in each inequality. For the left inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) => n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001 => n\u03c0 < 10000 => n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886. For the right inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n\u03c0 > 1/0.001 => n\u03c0 > 1000 => n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886. So, n must be an integer greater than 318.309886 and less than 3183.09886. Therefore, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest integer n is 3183. Now, how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive? The formula for the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319. Let's break it down: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, that's correct. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts. But wait, I'm a bit concerned because sometimes when dealing with inequalities, especially when dealing with reciprocals, it's easy to flip the inequality signs incorrectly. Let me double-check the steps. Starting with x in (0.0001, 0.001), so x is between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), substituting gives 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Then, taking reciprocals (and remembering that taking reciprocals reverses the inequality if all terms are positive, which they are here), we get 1/0.001 > n\u03c0 > 1/0.0001. So, 1000 > n\u03c0 > 10000. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. Wait, but that would mean 1000 > n\u03c0 > 10000, which is impossible because 1000 is less than 10000. So, I think I made a mistake in flipping the inequalities when taking reciprocals. Let me correct that. So, starting with 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals, we have 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Because when you take reciprocals, the inequalities reverse. So, 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Then, dividing all parts by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. As before, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886 and less than approximately 3183.09886. Therefore, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, as I had before. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0), so as n increases, x decreases. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), x is decreasing as n increases. So, the smallest x is 0.001, which corresponds to the largest n, and the largest x is 0.0001, which corresponds to the smallest n. So, x = 0.001 is at n = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886, so the next integer is 319. Similarly, x = 0.0001 is at n = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886, so the integer part is 3183. So, n goes from 319 to 3183, inclusive, giving 2865 x-intercepts. Therefore, I think my initial calculation is correct.

    "text": " So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for each integer n. We found that n must be between approximately 318.309 and 3183.098, so n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of terms from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0, leading to x = 1/(n\u03c0). Within the interval (0.0001, 0.001), we determine the range of n by solving 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. This gives n between approximately 318.309 and 3183.098. Thus, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, yielding 2865 integer values.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

    "text": " So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183, inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a lot. Let me verify the bounds again. So, x = 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me solve for n again. For the lower bound: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183. For the upper bound: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, the minimum integer n is 319. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct. So, there are 2865 x-intercepts in that interval. I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me think about the behavior of the function. As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. However, in our case, x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a small interval, but still, as n increases, the points 1/(n\u03c0) get closer together. So, each time n increases by 1, x decreases by a small amount, so the function crosses the x-axis more frequently as x approaches 0. But in our case, the interval is fixed, so the number of zeros should be proportional to the length of the interval in some sense. Alternatively, the number of zeros can be approximated by the integral of the derivative over the interval, but I think the method I used is more straightforward here. So, I think 2865 is the correct number of x-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we determine where \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\).

    "text": " So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial substitution. Let me double-check. We have x = 1/(n\u03c0), and x must be in (0.0001, 0.001). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. That's correct. Then, solving for n: For the lower bound, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, and for the upper bound, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u21d2 n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but let me confirm that 3183 is included. Since 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/10000 \u2248 0.0001, but actually, 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since x must be greater than 0.0001, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is the lower bound. But the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, does x = 1/(3183\u03c0) equal 0.0001 exactly? Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0). 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.1416 \u2248 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.04 \u2248 127.32, 3183 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0928. Adding up: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62, plus 5.0928 \u2248 450.7128. So total \u2248 9549 + 450.7128 \u2248 10,000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10,000 = 0.0001. Therefore, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is the lower bound of the interval. Since the interval is open, we don't include x = 0.0001, so n should be less than 3183.098, meaning n can be up to 3183, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001, so n must be less than 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n can be 3183 because 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, we actually need n to be less than 3183.098, but n is an integer, so the maximum n is 3183. Wait, but if n = 3183, then x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is exactly the lower bound. Since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so n must be less than 3183.098. So, n can be up to 3183, but we need to check if x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Wait, no, because 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, so if x must be greater than 0.0001, then n must be less than 3183.098, meaning the maximum integer n is 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) would be slightly greater than 0.0001. Let me check that. 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 182\u03c0 \u2248 571.722, so total \u2248 9424.77796 + 571.722 \u2248 10,000.000. Wait, that's exactly 10,000. So, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. Wait, that can't be right because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so 3182\u03c0 \u2248 10,000 - \u03c0 \u2248 10,000 - 3.1416 \u2248 9996.8584. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.8584 \u2248 0.000100032, which is just slightly above 0.0001. Therefore, x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100032, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. Therefore, n can be 319 up to 3183, because x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded, but n = 3183 would give x = 0.0001, which is excluded. So, the maximum n is 3182. Wait, no, because n = 3183 gives x = 0.0001, which is excluded, so n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded, so the maximum n is 3182. Wait, but earlier I thought 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But let me compute more accurately. Let's compute 3183 * \u03c0:\n\n\u03c0 \u2248 3.1415926535\n\n3183 * 3.1415926535\n\nLet's compute 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796\n\n183 * \u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 180\u03c0 \u2248 565.48667, 3\u03c0 \u2248 9.42477, so total \u2248 565.48667 + 9.42477 \u2248 574.91144\n\nSo, total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796 + 574.91144 \u2248 9999.6894\n\nSo, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.6894 \u2248 0.0001000032, which is just barely above 0.0001. Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier thought. Wait, no, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.6894, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000032, which is greater than 0.0001. Therefore, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000032, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n can be up to 3183 because x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000032 > 0.0001. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, but it's actually approximately 9999.6894, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000032, which is just above 0.0001. Therefore, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is within the interval (0.0001, 0.001), so n can be 3183.\n\nSimilarly, let's check n = 319:\n\n319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477796, 19\u03c0 \u2248 59.69026042, so total \u2248 942.477796 + 59.69026042 \u2248 1002.168056\n\nSo, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.168056 \u2248 0.00099783, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval.\n\nWait, but 0.00099783 is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nWait, but 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099783, which is 0.00099783, which is 0.00099783, which is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nWait, but 0.00099783 is approximately 0.001, but it's slightly less, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n = 319 gives x \u2248 0.00099783, which is within the interval.\n\nSimilarly, n = 3183 gives x \u2248 0.0001000032, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\n2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nSo, there are 2865 integer values of n, which correspond to 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that 3183 - 319 is indeed 2864. Let's compute 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, adding 1 gives 2865.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again: the interval is (0.0001, 0.001). So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001.\n\nEach x-intercept is at x = 1/(n\u03c0), where n is an integer.\n\nSo, for each integer n, x = 1/(n\u03c0) must satisfy 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nWhich implies:\n\n1/(0.001) > n\u03c0 > 1/(0.0001)\n\nWhich is 1000 > n\u03c0 > 10000\n\nSo, 10000 < n\u03c0 < 1000\n\nWait, no, that's not correct.
