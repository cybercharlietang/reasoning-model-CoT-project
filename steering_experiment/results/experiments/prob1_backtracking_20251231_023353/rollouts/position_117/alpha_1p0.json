    "text": " Wait, but wait another thought: the function y = sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. So, between x=0.0001 and x=0.001, how many oscillations are there? Each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, we get another zero crossing. So, the number of zeros should be roughly (1/0.0001 - 1/0.001)/\u03c0. Let me compute that: 1/0.0001 = 10000, 1/0.001 = 1000, so 10000 - 1000 = 9000, divided by \u03c0 \u2248 2866.197. Hmm, that's close to 2865, which is the number I got earlier. So, that seems consistent. The difference is because I'm using exact integer counts, while this method is an approximation. So, perhaps 2865 is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of how many times 1/x passes through multiples of \u03c0 as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001. Let me see: when x is 0.001, 1/x is 1000. When x is 0.0001, 1/x is 10000. So, 1/x goes from 1000 to 10000 as x goes from 0.001 to 0.0001. The zeros occur at 1/x = n\u03c0, so n = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, up to n = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, as before. So, the number of zeros is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me check with n=3183: 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000031, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. Similarly, n=319 gives x \u2248 0.00099784, which is just below 0.001, so included. Therefore, the count is correct. So, the answer is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check my initial calculation again. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a +1. So, 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, sometimes when dealing with intervals, especially with functions like sin(1/x), the number of oscillations can be approximated, but in this case, since we have an exact count based on n, it's 2865.\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I made a mistake in the initial step. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is from x=0.0001 to x=0.001, but as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000. So, the function sin(1/x) will oscillate more as x approaches 0.0001. So, the zeros occur at 1/x = n\u03c0, meaning x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, as n increases, x decreases. Therefore, the x-values corresponding to zeros go from x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099784 down to x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000031. So, all these x-values lie within (0.0001, 0.001). So, the number of zeros is indeed 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is: the number of zeros is equal to the number of times 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. So, the first zero after x=0.001 is at x=1/(319\u03c0), and the last zero before x=0.0001 is at x=1/(3183\u03c0). So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n where 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183, which is 2865.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

    "text": " Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again about the formula. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a +1. So, if a=319 and b=3183, then the number is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, sometimes people think in terms of how many numbers are between a and b, exclusive, but in this case, we're including both endpoints because n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183, each corresponding to an x in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, I think 2865 is the correct answer. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is each n corresponding to exactly one x in the interval? Yes, because x = 1/(n\u03c0), and each n gives a unique x. So, for each integer n from 319 to 3183, we have exactly one x-intercept. Therefore, the total number is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's any overlap or if any n could produce the same x. Since n is an integer, and x = 1/(n\u03c0), each n gives a distinct x. So, no overlaps. Therefore, the count is accurate.\n\nAnother way to think about it: The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly as x approaches 0. Between 0.0001 and 0.001, it's oscillating quite a bit, but the number of zeros is determined by how many times 1/x crosses multiples of \u03c0. So, each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, we get another zero. So, the number of zeros is roughly the difference in 1/x at the endpoints divided by \u03c0. Let's compute that: At x=0.001, 1/x=1000. At x=0.0001, 1/x=10000. So, the interval in terms of 1/x is from 1000 to 10000. The number of zeros would be approximately the number of times 1/x passes through multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. So, the number of zeros is roughly (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 = 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866. But wait, our earlier calculation gave 2865, which is very close. The difference is because we're using the floor and ceiling functions when determining the range of n. So, this approximation is about 2866, but the exact count is 2865. That makes sense because the exact count considers the integer boundaries.\n\nWait, but in our initial calculation, we had n starting at 319 and ending at 3183, giving 2865. The approximation using (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 \u2248 2866, which is almost the same, just off by one. That's probably because the exact count is considering the exact points where 1/(n\u03c0) lies within the interval, whereas the approximation is a continuous measure.\n\nSo, I think 2865 is correct.

    "text": " Wait, but I just thought of something else. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly as x approaches 0. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), it's oscillating a lot, and each oscillation crosses zero twice, right? Because sin(\u03b8) crosses zero once between each peak and trough. Wait, no, actually, each time \u03b8 increases by \u03c0, sin(\u03b8) crosses zero once. So, for each n, we have a zero crossing at x=1/(n\u03c0). So, each n corresponds to exactly one zero crossing. Therefore, the number of zero crossings is equal to the number of integers n in the range 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183, which is 2865. So, I think that's the answer. But let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. Another way to think about it is: the function y = sin(1/x) has zeros at x = 1/(n\u03c0), n integer. So, in the interval (a, b), the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that a < 1/(n\u03c0) < b. Which is equivalent to 1/(b\u03c0) < n < 1/(a\u03c0). So, in our case, a = 0.0001, b = 0.001. So, 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0). Which is approximately 318.309 < n < 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, that's consistent with what I found earlier. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the open interval. Since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which doesn't include the endpoints, I need to ensure that x=1/(n\u03c0) is strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. So, for n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000031, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. For n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099784, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Therefore, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive are valid, and the count is 2865. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider how many times 1/x passes through multiples of \u03c0 as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001. Each time 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0, sin(1/x) crosses zero. So, the number of zeros is the number of multiples of \u03c0 between 1/0.001 and 1/0.0001. Let's compute those:\n\n1/0.001 = 1000\n\n1/0.0001 = 10000\n\nSo, the interval for \u03b8 = 1/x is from 1000 to 10000. The number of zeros is the number of times \u03b8 crosses a multiple of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. So, the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nDividing all parts by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nWhich is approximately 318.309 < n < 3183.098, as before. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, giving 2865 zeros.\n\nYes, that's consistent with the previous calculation.

    "text": " Wait, but wait a second, let me think again. When I have n starting at 319 and ending at 3183, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 +1. Let me compute that again: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, 2865 x-intercepts. But let me think about whether each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept. Since sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches zero, the function crosses the x-axis infinitely often near zero, but in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), it's a finite number of oscillations. Each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the function completes another half-period, leading to another x-intercept. So, the number of zeros should correspond to how many times 1/x passes through multiples of \u03c0 as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001. So, each time x decreases by a certain amount, 1/x increases, and each time it crosses n\u03c0, we get a zero. Therefore, the number of zeros is the number of integers n for which 1/(n\u03c0) lies in (0.0001, 0.001), which is exactly what we computed. So, 2865 seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about another way. The function sin(1/x) has a period of 2\u03c0/(1/x) = 2\u03c0x, but as x changes, the period changes. However, the number of zeros is determined by how many times 1/x crosses multiples of \u03c0 as x moves from 0.001 to 0.0001. So, the number of zeros is equal to the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is exactly the same as before. So, that reinforces that the count is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check the endpoints again. When x approaches 0.0001 from the right, 1/x approaches 10000, so n approaches 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n can be up to 3183, as we have. Similarly, when x approaches 0.001 from the left, 1/x approaches 1000, so n approaches 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n starts at 319. So, yes, the range is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if n=3183 is indeed less than 3183.098. Since n must be less than 3183.098, the maximum integer n is 3183, which is less than 3183.098, so that's correct. Similarly, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again: 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Alternatively, 3183 - 318 = 2865? Wait, no, 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the number of integers between a and b inclusive as floor(b) - ceil(a) +1. So, in this case, a = 318.309, b = 3183.098. So, ceil(a) = 319, floor(b) = 3183. So, number of integers = 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me take a smaller example. Suppose I have an interval (0.1, 1). Let's find the number of x-intercepts of sin(1/x) in that interval. So, x is between 0.1 and 1. Then, 1/x is between 1 and 10. So, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, 0.1 < 1/(n\u03c0) <1. So, 1 < n\u03c0 <10, so n\u03c0 >1 => n > 1/\u03c0 \u2248 0.318, so n \u22651. And n\u03c0 <10 => n <10/\u03c0 \u22483.183, so n \u22643. So, n=1,2,3. So, number of x-intercepts is 3. Let me check: x=1/\u03c0\u22480.318, which is in (0.1,1), x=1/(2\u03c0)\u22480.159, also in the interval, x=1/(3\u03c0)\u22480.106, which is just above 0.1, so included. So, three x-intercepts. So, using the formula: floor(10/\u03c0)=3, ceil(1/\u03c0)=1, so 3-1+1=3. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, in our problem, the number is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the open interval. Since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), open, we don't include x=0.0001 or x=0.001. So, does that mean that n=3183, which gives x\u22480.0001000031, is included because it's just above 0.0001? Similarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.00099784, which is just below 0.001, so it's included. Therefore, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive give x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, the count remains 2865.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that 1/(3183\u03c0) is indeed greater than 0.0001. As calculated earlier, 3183\u03c0\u22489999.689, so 1/9999.689\u22480.000100003, which is indeed greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Similarly, 1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.00099784, which is less than 0.001, so included.

    "text": " Wait, but let me think again. When you have a function like sin(1/x), as x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a small interval near zero, how does the function behave? It oscillates more and more rapidly as x approaches zero. So, each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the function crosses zero. So, the number of zeros is approximately the number of times 1/x increases by \u03c0 as x goes from 0.001 to 0.0001. Wait, but in our case, we're looking at x from 0.0001 to 0.001, so 1/x goes from 10000 down to 1000. So, the total change in 1/x is 9000. Each zero crossing occurs every \u03c0 units. So, the number of zero crossings would be approximately 9000 / \u03c0, which is about 2866. But wait, that's close to the 2865 we calculated earlier. So, that seems consistent. Wait, but why is there a slight difference? Because when we calculated n from 319 to 3183, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. But 9000 / \u03c0 \u2248 2866.48. So, the exact count is 2865, which is very close to the approximate value. So, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a miscalculation in the initial subtraction. 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 is 2865. But 3183 - 319 is 2864? Let me compute 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 -19 = 2864. Yes, correct. So, 2864 +1 = 2865.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the number of integers between a and b inclusive as floor(b) - ceil(a) +1. In this case, a = 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309, so ceil(a) = 319. And b = 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so floor(b) = 3183. Then, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, that's consistent.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is: the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer n. So, we need 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Rearranged, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Then, dividing by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me think about whether each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept in the interval. Since sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches zero, each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the function completes a half-period, leading to a zero crossing. So, the number of zero crossings is the number of times 1/x passes through integer multiples of \u03c0 in the interval (1000, 10000). So, the number of multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000 is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0) +1, which is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check with n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100003, which is just above 0.0001, so included. n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099784, which is just below 0.001, so included. Therefore, all n from 319 to 3183 give x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, the count is correct.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer should be 2865 x-intercepts.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), the function oscillates between -1 and 1, crossing the x-axis each time 1/x increases by \u03c0. So, each time 1/x passes through n\u03c0, there's an x-intercept. So, the number of x-intercepts is the number of times 1/x crosses n\u03c0 in that interval. So, as x goes from 0.001 down to 0.0001, 1/x goes from 1000 up to 10000. So, the number of times sin(1/x) crosses zero is the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000.

So, that seems consistent. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me check if I'm not missing any edge cases. For example, does n=319 give x=1/(319\u03c0) which is less than 0.001? As we saw earlier, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099784, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Similarly, n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001000031, which is greater than 0.0001, so included. So, all n from 319 to 3183 are valid, and each gives exactly one x-intercept in the interval.

So, between 0.0001 and 0.001, the function will oscillate many times, each oscillation crossing the x-axis twice, once going up and once going down. Wait, but wait, sin(\u03b8) crosses zero once between each maximum and minimum, but in reality, it crosses zero once every \u03c0 interval, so between each n\u03c0 and (n+1)\u03c0, it crosses zero once. Wait, but in this case, since we're looking at x in (0.0001, 0.001), which corresponds to \u03b8 = 1/x in (1000, 10000). So, \u03b8 ranges from 1000 to 10000 radians. Now, how many times does sin(\u03b8) cross zero in \u03b8 from 1000 to 10000? Each zero crossing occurs at \u03b8 = k\u03c0, where k is integer. So, the number of zero crossings is the number of integers k such that 1000 < k\u03c0 < 10000. Solving for k: 1000 < k\u03c0 < 10000 => 1000/\u03c0 < k < 10000/\u03c0.

Therefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But let me just confirm that each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept. Since sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly as x approaches 0, each time 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0, the function crosses zero. So, each n gives exactly one zero crossing. So, the number of zeros is equal to the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) lies in (0.0001, 0.001). So, the calculation seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me check the initial inequality again. When I have 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, that implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than that, meaning the maximum integer n is 3183. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309, so the minimum integer n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 -19 = 2864. Then, 2864 +1 = 2865. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the number of zeros is the number of times 1/x passes through multiples of \u03c0 as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001. Each time 1/x crosses n\u03c0, we get a zero. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1/x = n\u03c0, which is equivalent to x = 1/(n\u03c0) lying in (0.0001, 0.001). So, that's the same as finding n where 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, because 0.0001 = 1/10000 and 0.001 = 1/1000. So, 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0), and x is between 1/10000 and 1/1000, which implies that n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000. Therefore, n is between 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, which gives us 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865 zeros.\n\nWait, but 1000/\u03c0 is approximately 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 is approximately 3183.098, so the largest integer n is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Therefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about the behavior of the function. As x approaches 0 from the positive side, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is quite close to zero, the function oscillates very rapidly. Each oscillation crosses zero twice (once going up, once going down), but wait, actually, each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the sine function completes a half-period, so each zero crossing occurs every \u03c0 increase in 1/x. Wait, no, actually, sin(\u03b8) is zero at \u03b8 = n\u03c0, so each zero occurs at \u03b8 = n\u03c0, so each time \u03b8 increases by \u03c0, we get another zero. Therefore, the number of zeros in \u03b8 between a and b is roughly (b - a)/\u03c0. But in our case, \u03b8 = 1/x, so as x goes from 0.001 to 0.0001, \u03b8 goes from 1000 to 10000. So, the number of zeros is approximately (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 = 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.198. Wait, but that's approximately 2866. But our exact calculation gave 2865. Hmm, that's very close. The difference is because when we take the exact integer counts, we might be off by one due to the endpoints. So, the approximate number is about 2866, but the exact count is 2865. That seems consistent.\n\nWait, let me compute 9000/\u03c0: 9000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 2866.198. So, approximately 2866 zeros. But our exact calculation gave 2865. So, why the difference? It's because when we take the exact integer values, we might be excluding one endpoint. Since our interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), we don't include the endpoints, so perhaps the exact count is one less than the approximate. So, 2865 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approximate method counts the number of intervals between zeros, which is one more than the number of zeros. Wait, no, each interval between two consecutive zeros is \u03c0 in \u03b8, so the number of zeros is (\u03b8_final - \u03b8_initial)/\u03c0. So, \u03b8_final is 10000, \u03b8_initial is 1000, so (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 = 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.198. So, approximately 2866 zeros. But our exact calculation gave 2865. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps the exact count is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0) +1. Let's compute:\n\n10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so floor(10000/\u03c0) = 3183\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so ceil(1000/\u03c0) = 319\n\nSo, 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nAlternatively, the approximate method is (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.198, which is about 2866. So, the exact count is 2865, which is one less than the approximate. That's because when we take the difference \u03b8_final - \u03b8_initial, we're measuring the total span, but the number of zeros is the number of times \u03b8 crosses n\u03c0 within that span. So, the number of zeros is floor(\u03b8_final / \u03c0) - ceil(\u03b8_initial / \u03c0) +1.\n\nIn this case, \u03b8_initial = 1000, \u03b8_final = 10000.\n\nfloor(10000/\u03c0) = 3183\n\nceil(1000/\u03c0) = 319\n\nSo, 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nTherefore, the exact number is 2865, which aligns with our initial calculation.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the number of x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integers n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 1/(n\u03c0) must be between 0.0001 and 0.001. Solving for n, we find n ranges from 319 to 3183. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

    "text": " Wait, but let me think again: when you have an open interval, sometimes endpoints can be tricky. But in this case, since n=3183 gives x just above 0.0001, and n=319 gives x just below 0.001, both are included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, all the x-values corresponding to n from 319 to 3183 are within the interval. Therefore, the total number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me check if I subtracted correctly: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 gives 2865. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, that's the number of x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times as x approaches 0, but in this case, we're only looking between x=0.0001 and x=0.001. So, each time 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0, we get an x-intercept. So, the number of intercepts is essentially the number of times 1/x crosses n\u03c0 in that interval, which corresponds to x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, the count is as we calculated.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that there's no overlap or missing points. Since each n gives a unique x in the interval, and the function sin(1/x) is continuous, each x corresponds to exactly one intercept. So, the count should be accurate.\n\nWait, but let me think about the function sin(1/x) near x=0.0001 and x=0.001. As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. But in our case, x is bounded away from zero by 0.0001, so the oscillations are finite in this interval. Wait, no, actually, 0.0001 is still very close to zero, so 1/x is 10,000, which is a large number, so sin(1/x) will oscillate rapidly between -1 and 1 as x approaches 0.0001 from the right. So, the number of oscillations between x=0.0001 and x=0.001 is finite, but how many times does it cross zero?\n\nEach time 1/x increases by \u03c0, we get another zero crossing. So, the number of zero crossings is the number of times 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0 as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001. Wait, but in our case, x is increasing from 0.0001 to 0.001, so 1/x is decreasing from 10,000 to 1000. So, as x increases, 1/x decreases, so sin(1/x) oscillates from sin(1000) down to sin(1000). Wait, but actually, as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x decreases from 10,000 to 1000, so sin(1/x) goes from sin(10,000) to sin(1000). But the number of zero crossings is determined by how many times 1/x crosses multiples of \u03c0 in that interval.\n\nSo, the initial value of 1/x is 10,000 at x=0.0001, and it decreases to 1000 at x=0.001. So, the number of times 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10,000 is the number of n's such that n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10,000. Wait, that seems different from what I thought earlier. Wait, hold on, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, earlier I set x = 1/(n\u03c0), but perhaps I should consider that as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x decreases from 10,000 to 1000. So, the values of 1/x go from 10,000 down to 1000. So, the multiples of \u03c0 that lie between 1000 and 10,000 are the ones that correspond to zero crossings. So, the number of n's such that n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10,000. So, n must satisfy 1000 \u2264 n\u03c0 \u2264 10,000. Therefore, n must be between 1000/\u03c0 and 10,000/\u03c0. Calculating those:\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098861\n\n10,000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098862\n\nSo, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183, inclusive, as before. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, that confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when 1/x decreases from 10,000 to 1000, it crosses every multiple of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10,000 exactly once. Each crossing corresponds to a zero of sin(1/x), so each n from 319 to 3183 gives exactly one zero crossing in the interval. Therefore, the total number is 2865.\n\nI think that's correct. So, after all that, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

As x approaches zero from the positive side, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates increasingly rapidly. The zeros of sin(1/x) occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0), as we established.\n\nSo, in the interval (a, b), where a = 0.0001 and b = 0.001, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (a, b). Which is the same as n being in (1/(b\u03c0), 1/(a\u03c0)).\n\nSo, 1/(b\u03c0) = 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309\n\n1/(a\u03c0) = 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098\n\nSo, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nThus, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer.

    "text": " Wait, but let me think again: when n increases, the x-intercepts get closer together as x approaches 0, but in our case, the interval is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a small range, so the function sin(1/x) oscillates more as x approaches 0, but in this interval, it's a specific range. Each time n increases by 1, we get another x-intercept. So, the number of x-intercepts is equal to the number of integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me see if there's another way to approach this problem. Alternatively, the function sin(1/x) has a period of 2\u03c0 in terms of 1/x. So, the number of oscillations between x=a and x=b is roughly (1/a - 1/b)/(2\u03c0). Wait, let me think: the function sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. The number of zeros between x=a and x=b (where 0 < a < b) is approximately (1/a - 1/b)/(\u03c0). Because each zero occurs every \u03c0 interval in the argument 1/x. So, the number of zeros N \u2248 (1/a - 1/b)/\u03c0. Let me compute that with a=0.0001 and b=0.001. So, 1/a = 10000, 1/b = 1000. So, (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 = 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.197. So, approximately 2866 zeros. But earlier, I got 2865. Hmm, that's close, but there's a slight discrepancy. Wait, perhaps because the exact count is the floor or ceiling of that value. Let me check: 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.197, so that's approximately 2866. But in my earlier calculation, I got 2865. So, which one is correct? Wait, perhaps because the formula gives an approximate value, but the exact count is 2865. Alternatively, maybe I missed something in the initial calculation. Wait, let me see: 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Alternatively, using the formula, (1/a - 1/b)/\u03c0 = (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 = 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.197, which is approximately 2866. So, there's a difference of one. Hmm, perhaps because when I take the integer parts, I have to consider whether to round up or down. Let me see: 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, perhaps the exact count is 2865, while the approximate formula gives 2866.197, which is about 2866. So, the exact count is 2865.

So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is very close to zero, the function oscillates rapidly. Each oscillation crosses the x-axis twice, once going up and once going down. Wait, no, actually, for each period, sine function crosses zero twice. So, the number of zeros should be roughly twice the number of periods in that interval.

So, in the interval (a, b), the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (a, b). So, solving for n, as I did before, n must satisfy 1/(b\u03c0) < n < 1/(a\u03c0).

    "text": " Wait, but let me check: when n increases by 1, x decreases by 1/(n+1)\u03c0 - 1/n\u03c0. Wait, but each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept, so the number of intercepts is the number of integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. So, the number is 3183 - 319 +1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 is 2865. So, 2865 x-intercepts. But wait, let me think again: when n increases, x decreases, so each n corresponds to a unique x in the interval. Therefore, the number of intercepts is indeed 2865. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the number of times the sine function oscillates as x approaches zero. Since 1/x approaches infinity as x approaches zero from the positive side, the function sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times, but in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a finite interval, how many zeros are there? Each zero corresponds to a crossing from positive to negative or vice versa. But in reality, each zero crossing occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0), so the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001). So, that's exactly what I calculated earlier: n from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 2865 zeros. Therefore, the answer should be 2865. But let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me recompute the bounds for n. Starting with the lower bound: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183. Similarly, the upper bound: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, the minimum integer n is 319. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.

We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 1/(n\u03c0) between these values. Solving for n gives n between approximately 318.309 and 3183.098, so n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

Alternatively, I can think of it as starting at n=1, up to n=3183, which is 3183 numbers, and subtracting the numbers from n=1 to n=318, which is 318 numbers, so 3183 - 318 = 2865. That also gives 2865. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me think again: when n increases by 1, x decreases by a certain amount. So, each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept. So, the number of intercepts is equal to the number of valid n's, which is 2865. Therefore, the final answer should be 2865.

    "text": " Wait, but let me think again about the initial calculation. I had n from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. But let me check: if I have numbers from a to b inclusive, the count is b - a +1. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. That seems correct. Alternatively, let me think about how many integers are between 319 and 3183. For example, from 1 to 3183, there are 3183 numbers. From 1 to 318, there are 318 numbers. So, the numbers from 319 to 3183 would be 3183 - 318 = 2865. Wait, that's another way to look at it. So, yes, 3183 total numbers minus 318 gives 2865. That makes sense. So, I think that's the correct count. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The function sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0, but in this case, we're only looking between x=0.0001 and x=0.001. Each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the sine function completes a half-period, crossing zero each time. So, the number of zeros should correspond to how many times 1/x passes through multiples of \u03c0 in that interval. So, 1/x goes from 1000 to 10000 as x goes from 0.001 to 0.0001. So, the number of zeros is the number of multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. So, the number of integers n where n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000. So, n is between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.309 to 3183.098, which matches what I had before. So, the number of integers n in that range is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think about whether each n corresponds to exactly one zero crossing. Since sin(\u03b8) crosses zero once every \u03c0 interval, right? So, each n corresponds to exactly one zero crossing. So, the total number of zero crossings is the number of n's, which is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that between x=0.0001 and x=0.001, the function doesn't have any more oscillations that might lead to more zeros. But since we're considering x in that interval, and we've accounted for all n where 1/x = n\u03c0, I think that's comprehensive.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) crosses the x-axis whenever 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0, i.e., at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n.

So, between 0.0001 and 0.001, the function oscillates rapidly, crossing the x-axis each time 1/x increases by \u03c0. So, the number of zeros should be roughly proportional to the change in 1/x divided by \u03c0. Let me compute 1/0.001 = 1000, and 1/0.0001 = 10000. So, the change in 1/x is 10000 - 1000 = 9000.

In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is quite close to zero, the function oscillates very rapidly. Each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the sine function completes a half-period, so the number of zeros would be approximately the difference in 1/x divided by \u03c0.

So, which one is correct? Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of n's range. Let me re-examine the inequalities. So, 0.0001 < x < 0.001, and x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let's solve for n in each inequality.\n\nFirst inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0)\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0: 0.0001 * n\u03c0 < 1\n\nDivide both sides by 0.0001\u03c0: n < 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) = 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618\n\nSecond inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618\n\nSo, n must satisfy 318.30988618 < n < 3183.0988618\n\nSince n must be an integer, the smallest integer greater than 318.30988618 is 319, and the largest integer less than 3183.0988618 is 3183.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nNumber of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1.\n\nSo, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nBut the approximation suggested around 2866.

Each oscillation crosses the x-axis twice, but wait, no, each time sin(\u03b8) crosses zero once per \u03c0 interval. Wait, no, actually, sin(\u03b8) has zeros at \u03b8 = n\u03c0, so each zero crossing occurs every \u03c0 interval. So, for \u03b8 = 1/x, as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001, \u03b8 increases from 1000 to 10000. So, the number of zeros would be the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000.

Let me take a smaller example where n starts at a and ends at b. The number of integers is b - a +1. So, if a=3 and b=5, numbers are 3,4,5: 3 numbers. 5-3+1=3. Correct.

Yes, because for each integer n, x=1/(n\u03c0) is unique and lies within (0.0001, 0.001). So, the number of x-intercepts is equal to the number of integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive, which is 2865.\n\nWait, but I just realized something: as x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a finite interval, how does that affect the number of oscillations? Wait, but in this problem, we're only considering x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 1/x is in (1000, 10000). So, the function sin(1/x) will oscillate between -1 and 1, crossing the x-axis each time 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0, which is exactly what we've calculated. So, each x-intercept corresponds to a zero crossing at x=1/(n\u03c0), and since 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000, which is the same as n between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.309 to 3183.098, so n from 319 to 3183, which gives 2865 zeros.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that 1000/\u03c0 is approximately 318.309, and 10000/\u03c0 is approximately 3183.098.

So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: the number of zeros is equal to the number of times the argument of the sine function, which is 1/x, crosses a multiple of \u03c0 as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001. Each crossing corresponds to a zero of the sine function, hence an x-intercept. So, the number of crossings is equal to the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 between 1/0.001 = 1000 and 1/0.0001 = 10000. So, the number of integers n where n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000 \u2264 n\u03c0 \u2264 10000. Therefore, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 \u2264 n \u2264 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.309 \u2264 n \u2264 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me check if n=319 gives 319\u03c0 \u2248 1003.5, which is greater than 1000, and n=3183 gives 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.69, which is less than 10000. So, yes, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive satisfy 1000 \u2264 n\u03c0 \u2264 10000. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nI think that's the answer. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) crosses the x-axis whenever 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0. This occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. To find the number of such x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), we determine the range of n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving these inequalities gives n between approximately 318.309 and 3183.098. Thus, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is equal to the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001).

So, the function y = sin(1/x) crosses the x-axis 2865 times between x=0.0001 and x=0.001. But wait, I feel like that's a lot of intercepts. Let me see: the interval is from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is a span of 0.0009. But as x approaches 0, the function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is near zero, the function oscillates very rapidly, leading to many zeros. So, 2865 intercepts in that tiny interval seems plausible.

    "text": " Wait, but let me think again: each time n increases by 1, x decreases by 1/(n\u03c0 + (n+1)\u03c0) approximately? Wait, perhaps a better way is to think about how many times the sine function oscillates as x approaches zero. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more frequently as x approaches zero. Each oscillation corresponds to a peak and a trough, and between each peak and trough, there's an x-intercept. So, the number of x-intercepts in the interval (a, b) where 0 < a < b < 1 would be approximately the number of times 1/x crosses an integer multiple of \u03c0 as x goes from a to b. So, starting from x = 0.001 (which is 1/1000) down to x = 0.0001 (which is 1/10000). So, 1/x goes from 1000 to 10000. So, the number of times sin(1/x) crosses zero is equal to the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. So, the number of zeros is equal to the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Wait, that's similar to what I did earlier. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098862.

Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me think about it another way. The function sin(1/x) has a zero whenever 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). The interval we're looking at is (0.0001, 0.001), which is (1/10000, 1/1000). So, we can think of n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is between 1/10000 and 1/1000. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 1/10000 implies n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 1/1000 implies n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.

Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, yes, 2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check another approach. The function sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. The number of oscillations between x = a and x = b is roughly proportional to the difference in 1/x. So, between x = 0.0001 and x = 0.001, 1/x goes from 10000 to 1000. The number of zeros of sin(\u03b8) between \u03b8 = 1000 and \u03b8 = 10000 is approximately the number of times \u03b8 crosses a multiple of \u03c0. So, the number of zeros is roughly (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 = 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866. But wait, that's close to 2865, which we got earlier. Hmm, so that seems consistent. The slight difference is due to the endpoints. So, that gives me more confidence that 2865 is the correct number.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I got 2865, but this rough estimate gives 2866. Is that because the exact count includes both endpoints? Let me think: when \u03b8 goes from 1000 to 10000, the number of zeros is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0). Let me compute 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so ceil(1000/\u03c0) = 319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so floor(10000/\u03c0) = 3183.

    "text": " Wait, but let me think again: when n increases by 1, x decreases by a certain amount, and each time x crosses 0, it's an intercept. But since sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely as x approaches 0, but in our case, x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a finite interval, but very small. The function sin(1/x) will cross the x-axis each time 1/x increases by \u03c0. So, the number of crossings should be roughly the difference in 1/(x\u03c0) between the endpoints. Let me see: The number of zeros is the number of times 1/x crosses multiples of \u03c0 between 1/(0.001\u03c0) and 1/(0.0001\u03c0).

So, the number of multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000 is the number of n where n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000.

Well, the number of zeros would be the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Which is approximately 318.309 < n < 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, which gives 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865 zeros. So, that's consistent with what I found earlier. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but hold on a second: sin(1/x) has a zero at every x = 1/(n\u03c0), so each zero is at a distinct x. So, the count is indeed 2865. But wait, sometimes people might think about the number of oscillations, but each zero crossing is just once per period, but in this case, it's once every \u03c0 interval in \u03b8, which translates to once every 1/(n\u03c0) in x. So, the count is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the number of zeros by considering the interval in terms of \u03b8. Let me try that approach to cross-verify.\n\nGiven x \u2208 (0.0001, 0.001), so \u03b8 = 1/x \u2208 (1000, 10000). So, \u03b8 ranges from 1000 to 10000 radians. The number of zeros of sin(\u03b8) in this interval is the number of times \u03b8 crosses a multiple of \u03c0. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that n\u03c0 \u2208 (1000, 10000). So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which is the same as 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. As before, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. Therefore, the number of zeros is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, that's consistent with my previous calculation.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\). This occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for some integer \\( n \\), which implies \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n\nWe need \\( x \\) to satisfy \\( 0.0001 < x < 0.001 \\). Substituting \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\) into this inequality, we get:\n\\[ 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\]\n\nRewriting these inequalities to solve for \\( n \\):\n\\[ 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\implies n < \\frac{1}{0.0001\\pi} \\approx 3183.098 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\implies n > \\frac{1}{0.001\\pi} \\approx 318.309 \\]\n\nThus, \\( n \\) must be an integer in the range from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers in this range is calculated as:\n\\[ 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts is \\(\\boxed{2865}\\)."
