Therefore, both n = 319 and n = 3183 give x within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the count from n = 319 to n = 3183 inclusive is correct, giving 2865 x-intercepts. Wait, but let me make sure that there are no other x-intercepts in that interval besides those given by x = 1/(n\u03c0). Since sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0, but in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is close to zero but not too close, the function sin(1/x) will oscillate between -1 and 1, crossing the x-axis each time 1/x increases by \u03c0. So, each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, we get another zero crossing. So, the number of zero crossings is essentially the number of times 1/x can pass through multiples of \u03c0 as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001. So, each n corresponds to exactly one zero crossing. Therefore, the count should be correct. So, I think 2865 is the right answer. But just to make sure, let me compute 3183 - 319 +1 again. 3183 minus 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Yep, that seems right.

So, both n = 319 and n = 3183 give x within the interval, so they are included. Therefore, the count is indeed 2865. Wait, but let me just confirm with exact values. Let me compute n_min and n_max more precisely. Let me compute 1/(0.0001\u03c0) exactly: 1/(0.0001 * \u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618.

Let me re-express the inequalities:\n\nWe have 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nTaking reciprocals (and remembering that reversing the inequalities when taking reciprocals because reciprocation is a decreasing function for positive numbers):\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nThen, dividing all parts by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nCalculating:\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184\n\n10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, n must satisfy 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184\n\nSince n must be an integer, the smallest integer greater than 318.309886184 is 319, and the largest integer less than 3183.09886184 is 3183.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nNumber of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1.\n\nSo, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n.

If n = 3184, then x = 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10001.0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. Therefore, n cannot be 3184. So, n goes up to 3183. Similarly, n cannot be 318, because x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.0) \u2248 0.001, but since the interval is open, x = 0.001 is excluded, so n must be greater than 318.309, so n starts at 319. Therefore, the total number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me think about the function y = sin(1/x). As x approaches 0 from the positive side, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is very close to zero, the function will oscillate a lot, crossing the x-axis each time 1/x increases by \u03c0. So, each time x decreases by approximately \u03c0/(n^2) or something like that. But in any case, the number of zeros should correspond to the number of times 1/x passes through multiples of \u03c0 as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001. So, each zero corresponds to an n, and the count is as we calculated. I think that makes sense. So, I'm confident that the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0, i.e., x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer n.

Wait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the initial calculation of n's range. Let me recast the inequalities:\n\nGiven 0.0001 < x < 0.001,\n\nand x = 1/(n\u03c0),\n\nthen 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001,\n\nwhich implies:\n\n1/(0.001) > n\u03c0 > 1/(0.0001),\n\nso 1000 > n\u03c0 > 10000,\n\nDividing by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 > n > 10000/\u03c0,\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\nn < 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309,\n\nand n > 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098.\n\nWait, wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, hold on, I think I messed up the inequality direction when taking reciprocals.\n\nLet me go back. Starting from:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nIf I take reciprocals, I have to reverse the inequalities because reciprocating positive numbers reverses the inequality.\n\nSo, 1/(0.001) > n\u03c0 > 1/(0.0001),\n\nWhich is 1000 > n\u03c0 > 10000.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 10000 is greater than 1000, so n\u03c0 must be between 10000 and 1000? That doesn't make sense because 10000 is larger than 1000. So, I must have messed up the reciprocals.\n\nLet me correct this.\n\nGiven 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001,\n\nTaking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities):\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001,\n\nWhich is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nAh, that's correct. So, n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000.\n\nTherefore, n must satisfy:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000,\n\nSo,\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0,\n\nWhich is approximately:\n\n318.309 < n < 3183.098.\n\nSo, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nWait, that's the same result as before, so I didn't make a mistake in the initial calculation. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check with specific values.\n\nTake n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.5) \u2248 0.0009965, which is less than 0.001 and greater than 0.0001, so included.\n\nn = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) \u2248 0.0001, but since it's open interval, 0.0001 is excluded. Wait, but as I calculated earlier, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.7128, so x \u2248 0.0001000028, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nSimilarly, n = 3184: x = 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10002.9) \u2248 0.00009997, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded.\n\nSo, n goes up to 3183, which gives x just above 0.0001, so included.\n\nSimilarly, n = 318: x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.0) \u2248 0.001, but since the interval is open at 0.001, x = 0.001 is excluded, so n = 318 gives x \u2248 0.001, which is not included. So, n starts at 319 to ensure x < 0.001.\n\nWait, let me compute n = 318: x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000) \u2248 0.001, but since 318\u03c0 \u2248 1000.0, x \u2248 0.001, which is the upper bound of the interval, which is open, so x must be less than 0.001. Therefore, n = 318 would give x \u2248 0.001, which is not included, so n must start at 319 to give x \u2248 0.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so included.\n\nSimilarly, n = 3183 gives x \u2248 0.0001000028, which is just above 0.0001, so included.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me compute 3183 - 319 again to make sure.\n\n3183 minus 300 is 2883.\n\n2883 minus 19 is 2864.\n\nSo, 2864 +1 = 2865.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nI think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nThe function sin(1/x) has zeros at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer n. We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 1/(n\u03c0) must be in that interval. Solving for n gives n between approximately 318.309 and 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 2865 integers, hence 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nI think that's solid.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. To find the number of these intercepts in (0.0001, 0.001), solve for n:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u21d2 318.309 < n < 3183.098.

Let's compute step by step:\n\n3183 * 3 = 9549\n\n3183 * 0.1415926535 = ?\n\nFirst, 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3\n\n3183 * 0.04 = 127.32\n\n3183 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.001 = 3.183\n\nPlus 3183 * 0.0005926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.0005 = 1.5915\n\nPlus 3183 * 0.0000926535 \u2248 approx 0.295.\n\nAdding up: 3.183 + 1.5915 = 4.7745 + 0.295 \u2248 5.0695\n\nSo total of 0.1415926535 is approx 318.3 + 127.32 + 5.0695 \u2248 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.0695 \u2248 450.6895\n\nSo total 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 9549 + 450.6895 \u2248 9999.6895\n\nSo, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.6895 \u2248 0.0001000031, which is indeed just over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nSimilarly, for n=319:\n\n319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.14159265 \u2248 319*3=957, 319*0.14159265\u2248319*0.1=31.9, 319*0.04=12.76, 319*0.00159265\u22480.506.\n\nAdding up: 31.9 + 12.76 = 44.66 + 0.506 \u2248 45.166\n\nSo total is 957 + 45.166 \u2248 1001.166\n\nSo, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1001.166 \u2248 0.0009988, which is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nTherefore, both endpoints correspond to x within the open interval, so n=319 and n=3183 are both included.\n\nThus, the total number of intercepts is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the initial calculation. Sometimes when dealing with inequalities and reciprocal functions, it's easy to flip the direction or miscount.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\nWe have y = sin(1/x). The zeros occur when 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0).\n\nWe need x in (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nSo, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nTaking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities because reciprocals reverse the order for positive numbers):\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nCalculating:\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098861\n\n10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098861\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.3098861 and less than 3183.098861.\n\nSince n must be an integer, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nNumber of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a +1.\n\nSo, 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\). This occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for some integer \\( n \\), which implies \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n\nWe need \\( x \\) to be in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\). Therefore, we solve the inequality:\n\\[ 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\]\n\nTaking reciprocals (and reversing the inequalities):\n\\[ 1000 < n\\pi < 10000 \\]\n\nDividing by \\( \\pi \\):\n\\[ \\frac{1000}{\\pi} < n < \\frac{10000}{\\pi} \\]\n\nCalculating the bounds:\n\\[ \\frac{1000}{\\pi} \\approx 318.3098861 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{10000}{\\pi} \\approx 3183.098861 \\]\n\nThus, \\( n \\) must be an integer between 319 and 3183 inclusive.

Therefore, n = 3184 gives x outside the interval, so the maximum n is 3183. Similarly, n = 318 gives x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.008) \u2248 0.000999992, which is just below 0.001, so it's included in the interval. Wait, but earlier I thought n starts at 319, but let me check n = 318: x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.008) \u2248 0.000999992, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Wait, but earlier I had n > 318.309, so n starts at 319. But wait, n = 318 gives x \u2248 0.000999992, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, perhaps my initial calculation was wrong. Let me go back. When I solved 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, I got n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. But wait, when n = 318, x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999992 < 0.001, which is within the interval. So, why did I get n > 318.309? Let me check the inequality again. 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, meaning the smallest integer n is 319. But when n = 318, which is less than 318.309, x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999992 < 0.001, which is within the interval. So, that suggests that my initial inequality might have been incorrect. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the inequality. Let me double-check.\n\nStarting from 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0.\n\nThen, divide both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309.\n\nSo, n must be greater than approximately 318.309, meaning n starts at 319.\n\nBut wait, when n = 318, which is less than 318.309, x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999992 < 0.001, so it's included in the interval. That suggests that my inequality might be off.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that when I have 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, solving for n gives n > 1/(0.001\u03c0). So, n must be greater than 318.309, so n starts at 319. But when n = 318, which is less than 318.309, x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999992, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, that suggests that n can be 318 and still satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Therefore, perhaps my initial inequality was incorrect.\n\nWait, let me think again. If 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, then n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, meaning n starts at 319. But when n = 318, which is less than 318.309, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999992 < 0.001, so it's included. So, that suggests that the inequality n > 318.309 is correct, but n = 318 is less than 318.309, yet x is still less than 0.001. So, perhaps the inequality is correct, but n can be 318 because 318\u03c0 \u2248 1000.008, so 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999992 < 0.001, which is within the interval. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the inequality direction.\n\nWait, let's consider that 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nIf n is smaller, then 1/(n\u03c0) is larger. So, for n = 318, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999992 < 0.001, so it's included. So, n = 318 is allowed. Therefore, perhaps the correct inequality is n \u2265 319? Wait, no, because n = 318 is allowed.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to approach this differently. Let's consider that x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001.\n\nSo, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nSo, solving for n:\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001: n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098.\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001: n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 318.309 < n < 3183.098.\n\nSince n must be an integer, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that n = 318 gives x \u2248 0.000999992, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. But according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n starts at 319. Therefore, n = 318 is excluded because it's less than 318.309, but x = 1/(318\u03c0) is still less than 0.001. That seems contradictory.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify: when solving 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, we get n > 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, meaning the smallest integer n is 319. Therefore, n starts at 319, not 318. So, n = 318 is excluded because 318 < 318.309, so 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999992 < 0.001, but since n must be greater than 318.309, n = 318 is not allowed. Wait, that can't be, because 1/(318\u03c0) is still less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, perhaps the inequality is incorrect.\n\nWait, let me think again: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309.\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319.\n\nBut when n = 318, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999992 < 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, perhaps the inequality is correct, but n = 318 is still allowed because 1/(318\u03c0) < 0.001. Therefore, perhaps the correct range is n \u2265 319, but n = 318 is allowed because 1/(318\u03c0) is less than 0.001. Hmm, I'm confused.\n\nWait, let me test n = 318:\n\nx = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.008) \u2248 0.000999992, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval.\n\nSimilarly, n = 319:\n\nx = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.5) \u2248 0.0009965, which is also less than 0.001.\n\nWait, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n starts at 319. So, why is n = 318 allowed?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inequality direction. Let's solve 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 again.\n\n1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309.\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.309, so n starts at 319.\n\nBut when n = 318, which is less than 318.309, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999992 < 0.001, which is within the interval. So, that suggests that n can be less than 318.309 and still satisfy the inequality. That seems contradictory.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 is equivalent to n > 1/(0.001\u03c0). So, n must be greater than 318.309. Therefore, n = 318 is less than 318.309, so 1/(318\u03c0) would be greater than 0.001? Wait, no, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999992 < 0.001, so it's less than 0.001. Therefore, the inequality is correct, but n = 318 is allowed because 1/(318\u03c0) < 0.001, even though n = 318 < 318.309.\n\nWait, that suggests that the inequality n > 318.309 is not correct because n = 318, which is less than 318.309, still satisfies 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra. Let's go through it step by step.\n\nStarting with 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0.\n\nThen, divide both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0).\n\nSo, n > 318.309.\n\nTherefore, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319.\n\nBut when n = 318, which is less than 318.309, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999992 < 0.001, which is within the interval. So, that suggests that the inequality is correct, but n = 318 is allowed because 1/(318\u03c0) is less than 0.001, even though n is less than 318.309.\n\nWait, that can't be. If n > 318.309, then n = 318 is less than that, so 1/(n\u03c0) would be greater than 0.001, but in reality, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999992 < 0.001.\n\nSo, perhaps the inequality is incorrect.\n\nWait, let me test n = 318:\n\n1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999992 < 0.001, so it's within the interval.\n\nn = 319: 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009965 < 0.001.\n\nn = 317: 1/(317\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000 - 3.1416) \u2248 1/996.858 \u2248 0.001003, which is greater than 0.001, so it's outside the interval.\n\nAh, so when n = 317, x \u2248 0.001003 > 0.001, so it's excluded.\n\nn = 318: x \u2248 0.000999992 < 0.001, included.\n\nn = 319: x \u2248 0.0009965 < 0.001, included.\n\nSo, the smallest n that gives x < 0.001 is n = 318.\n\nBut according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n starts at 319.\n\nBut in reality, n = 318 gives x < 0.001, so it's included.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct range is n \u2265 318, but n must be less than 3183.098.\n\nWait, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n starts at 319.\n\nBut in reality, n = 318 gives x < 0.001, so it's included. Therefore, perhaps the inequality is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to approach this differently.

But in reality, it is included. Therefore, perhaps the inequality is incorrect.\n\nWait, let me test n = 318.309:\n\nn = 318.309: 1/(n\u03c0) = 1/(318.309 * \u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000) = 0.001.\n\nSo, when n = 318.309, x = 0.001, which is the upper bound of the interval. Since the interval is open, x must be less than 0.001, so n must be greater than 318.309 to have x < 0.001.\n\nBut when n = 318, which is less than 318.309, x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999992 < 0.001, so it's included. Therefore, the inequality is correct in that n must be greater than 318.309, but n = 318 is allowed because it's close enough to make x < 0.001. Wait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because n is an integer. So, when n = 318, which is less than 318.309, x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999992 < 0.001, so it's included. Therefore, the correct range is n \u2265 318, but n must be greater than 318.309, so n starts at 319.\n\nWait, but that's not possible because n = 318 is allowed. Therefore, perhaps the correct range is n \u2265 318, but n must be less than 3183.098, so n goes from 318 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nn = 318: x \u2248 0.000999992 < 0.001, included.\n\nn = 317: x \u2248 1/(317\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000 - 3.1416) \u2248 1/996.858 \u2248 0.001003 > 0.001, excluded.\n\nSo, n starts at 318.\n\nSimilarly, n = 3183: x \u2248 0.0001000028 > 0.0001, included.\n\nn = 3184: x \u2248 0.00009997 < 0.0001, excluded.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 318 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3183 - 318 + 1 = 2866.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier calculation. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by starting at n = 319. The correct starting point is n = 318.\n\nSo, let's recalculate:\n\nn starts at 318 and ends at 3183.\n\nNumber of integers = 3183 - 318 + 1 = 2866.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3183 - 318 = 2865, then +1 = 2866.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nBut earlier, I thought n starts at 319 because of the inequality, but now I see that n = 318 is allowed because x is still less than 0.001.\n\nTherefore, the correct number of x-intercepts is 2866.\n\nWait, but let me confirm:\n\nn = 318: x \u2248 0.000999992 < 0.001, included.\n\nn = 317: x \u2248 0.001003 > 0.001, excluded.\n\nn = 3183: x \u2248 0.0001000028 > 0.0001, included.\n\nn = 3184: x \u2248 0.00009997 < 0.0001, excluded.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 318 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nNumber of integers: 3183 - 318 + 1 = 2866.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2866.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, which one is correct?\n\nLet me compute 3183 - 318:\n\n3183 - 300 = 2883\n\n2883 - 18 = 2865\n\nThen, +1 = 2866.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the correct number is 2866.\n\nTherefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2866 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\nx-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n.\n\nWe need 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nSolving for n:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098\n\n1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309\n\nSo, n must be an integer such that 318.309 < n < 3183.098.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n = 318 is allowed because x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999992 < 0.001.\n\nBut according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n starts at 319.\n\nBut when n = 318, x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999992 < 0.001, so it's included.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct range is n \u2265 318, but n must be less than 3183.098.\n\nWait, but according to the inequality, n > 318.309, so n starts at 319.\n\nBut when n = 318, x is still within the interval.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct range is n \u2265 318, but n must be greater than 318.309, which is a contradiction because n is an integer.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to take the ceiling of 318.309, which is 319, as the starting n.\n\nBut when n = 318, x is still within the interval, so it's included.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct number of n's is from 318 to 3183 inclusive, which gives 2866.\n\nBut according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n starts at 319.\n\nBut in reality, n = 318 is allowed because x is still within the interval.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct count is 2866.\n\nWait, I'm getting conflicting conclusions here.\n\nLet me think differently: the function sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely as x approaches 0. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is close to zero, the function oscillates very rapidly. The x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0), so for each integer n, we get an x-intercept.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts between a and b is approximately (1/(a\u03c0) - 1/(b\u03c0)).\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts in (0.0001, 0.001) would be approximately (1/(0.0001\u03c0) - 1/(0.001\u03c0)) = (10000/\u03c0 - 1000/\u03c0) = (9000)/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.198.\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of an intercept, we take the integer part, which is 2866.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2866.\n\nSo, that aligns with the earlier calculation where n ranges from 318 to 3183 inclusive, giving 2866 intercepts.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 2866.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. To find the number of these intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), we determine the range of n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving these inequalities gives n between approximately 318.309 and 3183.098. Thus, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, yielding 2865 intercepts. However, considering n = 318 also satisfies the condition, the correct count is 2866 intercepts.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2866}."

Wait, but let me just confirm that each n corresponds to exactly one x in the interval, and that we don't have any overlaps or missing points. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0) is a strictly decreasing function as n increases, each n gives a unique x in the interval. So, every integer n from 319 to 3183 corresponds to exactly one x-intercept in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the total number is 2865. I think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. We set sin(1/x) = 0, which implies 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). Then, we found the range of n such that x is between 0.0001 and 0.001. Solving for n, we get n between approximately 318.309 and 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.

Wait, but let me confirm with another approach. Alternatively, the number of zeros of sin(1/x) in (a, b) can be found by determining how many times 1/x crosses each multiple of \u03c0 as x decreases from b to a. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) lies in (a, b). So, in our case, a = 0.0001 and b = 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) must satisfy 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.

So, both n = 319 and n = 3183 give x-values just inside the open interval. Therefore, the count remains 2865. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't include n = 3183 if x is exactly 0.0001. But as I saw, x is slightly above 0.0001, so it's included. So, the count is correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me think again: the function y = sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is very close to 0, the function oscillates rapidly. Each oscillation corresponds to a peak and a trough, and between each peak and trough, there's an x-intercept. So, the number of x-intercepts should be proportional to the number of oscillations in that interval. Let me see if there's another way to compute this, maybe by considering the change in \u03b8 = 1/x as x moves from 0.001 to 0.0001. So, when x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001, \u03b8 increases from 1000 to 10000 radians. The number of zeros of sin(\u03b8) between \u03b8 = 1000 and \u03b8 = 10000 is equal to the number of times \u03b8 crosses a multiple of \u03c0. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000 \u2264 n\u03c0 \u2264 10000. Dividing by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 \u2264 n \u2264 10000/\u03c0. Calculating these: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, as before. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, this confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The function sin(1/x) has a zero whenever 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0, but each zero corresponds to a crossing from positive to negative or vice versa. However, between two consecutive zeros, there's exactly one peak or trough. So, the number of zeros is actually twice the number of periods minus one, or something like that? Wait, no, actually, in one full period of sine, which is 2\u03c0, there are two zeros: one at 0 and another at \u03c0, but actually, in the interval from 0 to 2\u03c0, sin(\u03b8) is zero at 0, \u03c0, and 2\u03c0. So, three zeros. Wait, no, actually, in the interval (0, 2\u03c0), sin(\u03b8) is zero at \u03b8 = \u03c0 and \u03b8 = 2\u03c0, but at \u03b8=0, it's also zero, but that's the endpoint. So, in the open interval (0, 2\u03c0), there are two zeros: \u03c0 and 2\u03c0. Wait, but that's not correct because between 0 and 2\u03c0, sin(\u03b8) is zero at \u03b8 = 0, \u03c0, and 2\u03c0. But since 0 and 2\u03c0 are endpoints, in the open interval (0, 2\u03c0), sin(\u03b8) is zero only at \u03b8 = \u03c0. Wait, that can't be right because sin(\u03b8) crosses zero at \u03b8 = \u03c0, but also at \u03b8 = 2\u03c0, which is the endpoint. So, in the open interval (0, 2\u03c0), there's only one zero at \u03b8 = \u03c0. Hmm, but that seems contradictory because I know that sin(\u03b8) crosses zero at \u03b8 = \u03c0, 2\u03c0, etc. Wait, no, actually, in the open interval (0, 2\u03c0), the zeros are at \u03b8 = \u03c0 and \u03b8 = 2\u03c0, but 2\u03c0 is excluded because it's the upper bound. So, only \u03b8 = \u03c0 is inside (0, 2\u03c0). Wait, but that can't be right because sin(\u03b8) is zero at \u03b8 = \u03c0, but also at \u03b8 = 2\u03c0, which is the boundary. So, in the open interval (0, 2\u03c0), there's only one zero at \u03b8 = \u03c0. But that seems off because I know that between 0 and 2\u03c0, the sine function starts at 0, goes up to 1 at \u03c0/2, back to 0 at \u03c0, down to -1 at 3\u03c0/2, and back to 0 at 2\u03c0. So, in the open interval (0, 2\u03c0), the zeros are at \u03b8 = \u03c0 and \u03b8 = 2\u03c0, but 2\u03c0 is excluded, so only \u03b8 = \u03c0 is inside. Wait, that seems correct. So, in the open interval (a, b), the number of zeros is equal to the number of times \u03b8 crosses n\u03c0 where n is an integer, excluding the endpoints if they are exactly at n\u03c0.\n\nWait, but in our problem, we're looking at \u03b8 from 1000 to 10000 radians. So, the number of zeros would be the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000, exclusive. So, n\u03c0 where n is an integer such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.309 < n < 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. Therefore, the number of zeros is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that's consistent with what I found earlier.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that each zero corresponds to an x-intercept, which is correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is indeed 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think about this differently. The function sin(1/x) has a period of 2\u03c0 in terms of \u03b8, where \u03b8 = 1/x. So, as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001, \u03b8 increases from 1000 to 10000. The number of periods in this interval is (10000 - 1000)/(2\u03c0) = 9000/(2\u03c0) \u2248 9000/6.283 \u2248 1432.39. So, approximately 1432 full periods. Each full period has two zeros (at \u03b8 = n\u03c0 and \u03b8 = (n+1)\u03c0), but wait, in each period from n\u03c0 to (n+1)\u03c0, there's only one zero at \u03b8 = (n+1)\u03c0. Wait, no, in each period of 2\u03c0, there are two zeros: one at the start and one at the end. But since we're considering the interval (1000, 10000), which is an open interval, we have to exclude the endpoints if they are exactly at n\u03c0. But in reality, the number of zeros is the number of times \u03b8 crosses n\u03c0 within that interval. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which is exactly what we calculated earlier: n from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 zeros.\n\nWait, but let me check: if I have \u03b8 from 1000 to 10000, how many multiples of \u03c0 are in that interval? Each multiple of \u03c0 is a zero. So, the first multiple after 1000 is the smallest n where n\u03c0 > 1000, which is n = 319, since 319\u03c0 \u2248 1003.5. The last multiple before 10000 is the largest n where n\u03c0 < 10000, which is n = 3183, since 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.71. So, the number of multiples is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that's consistent.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about the period and the number of periods being approximately 1432, but that's not directly relevant here because the number of zeros is determined by the number of times \u03b8 crosses n\u03c0, which is directly given by the number of integers n in that range. So, the period approach might not be the best way to think about it, but it's good to confirm that the number of zeros is indeed 2865.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: the change in \u03b8 is from 1000 to 10000, which is a change of 9000 radians. Each zero occurs every \u03c0 radians, so the number of zeros is approximately 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866. But since we're dealing with an open interval, we have to subtract 1 if the endpoints are exact multiples. But in our case, 1000 is not an exact multiple of \u03c0, nor is 10000. So, the number of zeros is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0) + 1. Wait, let's compute that: floor(10000/\u03c0) = floor(3183.098) = 3183. ceil(1000/\u03c0) = ceil(318.309) = 319. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that's another way to confirm it.\n\nWait, but let me check: floor(10000/\u03c0) is 3183, and ceil(1000/\u03c0) is 319. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something else. The function sin(1/x) has an infinite number of oscillations as x approaches 0, but in our case, we're looking at a finite interval, so the number of zeros is finite. So, 2865 is the correct count.\n\nWait, but let me just think about whether I might have made a mistake in the initial step. When I set sin(1/x) = 0, I get 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). Then, I substitute into the interval 0.0001 < x < 0.001, which gives 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Then, taking reciprocals (and remembering to reverse the inequalities because reciprocating positive numbers reverses the inequality), we get 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Then, dividing by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.309 < n < 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about whether I should include both endpoints. Since the interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. So, when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000028, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. Similarly, when n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009965, which is just below 0.001, so it's included. So, both endpoints are included in the interval, so both n = 319 and n = 3183 are valid, so the count is correct at 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check with n = 3183: 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 9999.7128, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000028, which is indeed greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Similarly, n = 319: 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 1003.5, so 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, both are valid.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that n\u03c0 is in (1000, 10000). So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which is the same as n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, giving 2865 integers.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3183 - 319. 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about whether there's a possibility that some n's might result in x being exactly 0.0001 or 0.001, which would be excluded. But as I saw earlier, n = 3183 gives x \u2248 0.0001000028, which is just above 0.0001, and n = 319 gives x \u2248 0.0009965, which is just below 0.001. So, neither of them equals exactly 0.0001 or 0.001, so both are included in the open interval. Therefore, the count remains 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is there a possibility that for some n, x = 1/(n\u03c0) could equal exactly 0.0001 or 0.001? Let's check. Suppose 1/(n\u03c0) = 0.0001. Then, n = 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. But n must be an integer, so n \u2248 3183.098 is not an integer, so there's no integer n for which x = 0.0001. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) = 0.001 implies n = 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, which is not an integer. So, there's no n that makes x exactly 0.0001 or 0.001, so all the x's we're counting are strictly inside the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, the count is accurate at 2865.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial substitution. The function is y = sin(1/x), so setting that equal to zero gives sin(1/x) = 0, which implies 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). That seems correct.\n\nWait, another thought: sometimes when dealing with trigonometric functions, especially with reciprocal arguments, there can be issues with the function's behavior, like asymptotes or undefined points, but in this case, sin(1/x) is defined for all x \u2260 0, so in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), it's smooth and oscillates without any issues. So, each x = 1/(n\u03c0) is a valid x-intercept.\n\nWait, but let me think about the density of these zeros. As x approaches 0, the zeros become more frequent. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a factor of 10 closer to zero, the number of zeros increases by a factor of 100, which seems correct because the function oscillates 100 times more rapidly.\n\nWait, but let me do a quick check with smaller intervals to see if the formula holds. Suppose I take the interval (0.0002, 0.0003). Let's compute the number of zeros there. Using the same method: x must satisfy 0.0002 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.0003. Taking reciprocals: 1/0.0003 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0002, which is approximately 3333.333 < n\u03c0 < 5000. So, n must satisfy 3333.333/\u03c0 < n < 5000/\u03c0. Calculating those: 3333.333/\u03c0 \u2248 1060.66, and 5000/\u03c0 \u2248 1591.549. So, n ranges from 1061 to 1591, inclusive. Number of integers: 1591 - 1061 + 1 = 531. Let's check if that makes sense. The change in \u03b8 is from 1/0.0003 \u2248 3333.333 to 1/0.0002 \u2248 5000, so the change is about 1666.666 radians. Number of zeros should be approximately 1666.666 / \u03c0 \u2248 531.0, which matches our count. So, the formula seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the number of x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where the function equals zero. The sine function is zero when its argument is an integer multiple of \\( \\pi \\). Therefore, we set \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\), which implies \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for some integer \\( n \\). Solving for \\( x \\), we get \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n\nNext, we need to find the range of \\( n \\) such that \\( x \\) lies within the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\).

The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is calculated as:\n\\[ 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\) is \\(\\boxed{2865}\\)."

Similarly, n=319 gives x \u2248 0.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so it's also included. Therefore, both endpoints of n are included, so the count is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, I think that's the correct number of x-intercepts. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's any possibility of missing some intercepts or counting extra ones. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0 from the right. So, between any two points near zero, there are infinitely many oscillations. But in our case, the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is a finite interval, albeit very small. So, the number of zeros should be finite, which matches our calculation. Each zero corresponds to a unique n, so as long as n is an integer in the range we found, each gives exactly one zero crossing. So, I think 2865 is the correct number. Wait, but let me make sure that n=3183 is the largest integer such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. Let me compute n_max = floor(1/(0.0001\u03c0)) = floor(10000/\u03c0) \u2248 floor(3183.098) = 3183. Similarly, n_min = ceil(1/(0.001\u03c0)) = ceil(1000/\u03c0) \u2248 ceil(318.309) = 319. So, yes, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the count is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) crosses the x-axis whenever 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0, i.e., at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. To find the number of such x in (0.0001, 0.001), we determine the range of n:\n\n1. Solve 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n2. This gives n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098.\n3. Thus, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n4. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

Wait, but let me make sure that for each n from 319 to 3183 inclusive, x = 1/(n\u03c0) is indeed in (0.0001, 0.001). Since n increases, x decreases. So, as n increases from 319 to 3183, x decreases from approximately 0.0009965 down to approximately 0.0001000028. So, all these x's are between 0.0001 and 0.001, so they are all included in the interval. Therefore, each n in 319 to 3183 corresponds to exactly one x-intercept in the given interval.

Therefore, the total number is 2865. Wait, but let me just confirm the calculation: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, I think that's correct. But just to make sure, maybe I can think about the behavior of the function. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a very small interval near zero, the function oscillates very rapidly. Each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the sine function completes a half-period, so each zero crossing occurs at intervals of \u03c0 in the argument 1/x. So, the number of zeros should be approximately the change in 1/x divided by \u03c0. Let's compute that. The interval for x is from 0.0001 to 0.001. So, 1/x goes from 10000 to 1000. The change in 1/x is 10000 - 1000 = 9000. So, the number of zeros should be approximately 9000 / \u03c0 \u2248 9000 / 3.1416 \u2248 2866. But wait, that's slightly different from 2865. Hmm, why is there a discrepancy? Wait, because when we take the difference in 1/x, it's from 1000 to 10000, which is an increase of 9000. Each zero crossing occurs every \u03c0 units in the argument, so the number of zeros is the number of times \u03c0 fits into 9000. So, 9000 / \u03c0 \u2248 2866. But earlier, I calculated 2865. The difference is 1. Hmm, perhaps because the endpoints don't both correspond to zero crossings. Wait, when x approaches 0.0001 from the right, 1/x approaches 10000 from above. Similarly, when x approaches 0.001 from the left, 1/x approaches 1000 from below. So, the number of zero crossings would be the number of times 1/x crosses an integer multiple of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. So, n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that matches my earlier calculation. The approximation using the change in 1/x over \u03c0 gave me 2866, but the exact count is 2865 because the upper bound is exclusive. So, the exact number is 2865. Therefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial substitution. I had x = 1/(n\u03c0), so n = 1/(x\u03c0). So, for x in (0.0001, 0.001), n must be in (1000/\u03c0, 10000/\u03c0), which is approximately (318.309, 3183.098). So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is: the function sin(1/x) has a zero whenever 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0. So, for each integer n, x = 1/(n\u03c0) is a zero. We need to count how many such x lie between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n: 1/(0.001) > n\u03c0 > 1/(0.0001), so 1000 > n\u03c0 > 10000, which is the same as 10000 < n\u03c0 < 1000. Wait, no, that seems contradictory. Wait, no, let me correct that. If 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, then taking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities because reciprocals reverse inequalities for positive numbers): 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 2865 integers. So, that confirms it again.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the number of zeros should be approximately the change in 1/x divided by \u03c0, which was 9000 / \u03c0 \u2248 2866. But exact count is 2865. The difference is because when you take the floor and ceiling, you might lose one. So, in the interval from 1000 to 10000, the number of multiples of \u03c0 is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0) + 1, which is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. Thus, n ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 x-intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

So, both endpoints are included in the interval, even though the interval is open because x is approaching from above and below. Wait, no, actually, the interval (a, b) includes all points x where a < x < b, so as long as x is strictly greater than a and strictly less than b, it's included. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000028 is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Similarly, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009965 is less than 0.001, so it's included. Therefore, both n=319 and n=3183 correspond to x-values within the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, the count remains 2865. Wait, but let me check: if n=3183 gives x \u2248 0.0001000028, which is just barely above 0.0001, so it's included. Similarly, n=319 gives x \u2248 0.0009965, which is just below 0.001, so it's included. So, both endpoints are included in the count. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me think again: when n increases, x decreases, right? Because x = 1/(n\u03c0), so as n increases, x gets smaller. So, the x-intercepts are getting closer together as x approaches 0.0001 from above. So, the function y = sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly as x approaches 0. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), the function will cross the x-axis each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, which corresponds to each integer n. So, each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept in that interval. Therefore, the total number of x-intercepts is the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001), which we found to be n from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 2865 intercepts. Hmm, that seems like a lot, but considering the function oscillates rapidly near zero, it makes sense. Let me just recap: We set sin(1/x) = 0, which implies 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n, we get n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309 and n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.

The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

As I calculated earlier, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.71, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000028, which is indeed greater than 0.0001, so x = 0.0001000028 is inside the interval (0.0001, 0.001).

So, n = 319 gives x \u2248 0.0009965, which is within (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n = 3183 gives x \u2248 0.0001000028, which is within the interval. So, both endpoints are included in the count because they are within the open interval. Therefore, the count from n = 319 to n = 3183 inclusive is correct, giving 2865 intercepts. Wait, but let me confirm that when n increases by 1, x decreases by 1/(n+1)\u03c0 - 1/(n\u03c0). So, each subsequent x is smaller than the previous one. So, starting from x \u2248 0.0009965 (n=319) and going down to x \u2248 0.0001000028 (n=3183), each step corresponds to an x-intercept.

But just to be thorough, let me check if there's any possibility of missing an intercept or counting an extra one. For example, does n=3183 give x just above 0.0001, which is included, and n=319 gives x just below 0.001, which is included. So, yes, both ends are included. Also, since the function sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely as x approaches 0, but in our case, x is bounded away from 0 by 0.0001, so the number of oscillations is finite. Each oscillation corresponds to a zero crossing, so the number of zeros is the number of times 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0, which is exactly what we calculated.
