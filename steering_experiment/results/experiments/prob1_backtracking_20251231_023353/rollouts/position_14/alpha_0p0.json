If I take reciprocals on both sides (remembering that flipping inequalities when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive), I get: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. 1/0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, I get n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me calculate that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 3183.0988618. So, n < approximately 3183.0988618. Since n has to be an integer, the maximum possible n is 3183. Now, let's look at the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 318.30988618. Since n has to be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319. So, n must be an integer greater than 318.30988618, which means n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. Now, I need to count how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers inclusive, I subtract the smaller number from the larger one and add 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n that satisfy the condition. Each of these n's corresponds to an x-intercept in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with the inequalities: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) must be between 0.0001 and 0.001. Solving for n, we get n\u03c0 between 1000 and 10000, so n between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.30988618 < n < 3183.0988618. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more gives 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 is 2865. So, yes, that seems correct. I think I've accounted for all the integer values of n in that range, so the number of x-intercepts should be 2865.

Taking reciprocals on both sides (and remembering that taking reciprocals reverses the inequality when both sides are positive, which they are here), we get: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0 \u21d2 10000 > n\u03c0. Similarly, for the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u21d2 n\u03c0 > 1/0.001 \u21d2 n\u03c0 > 1000. So, combining both inequalities, we have: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000 \u21d2 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me calculate these values. First, 1000 divided by \u03c0. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be an integer such that 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n starts at the next integer after 318.309886184, which is 319, and goes up to the integer just below 3183.09886184, which is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. Now, to find how many integers are in this range, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, number of integers = 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n in that range, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 1000/\u03c0 is approximately 318.309886184, and 10000/\u03c0 is approximately 3183.09886184. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct. Just to be thorough, let me check if n=319 gives x within the interval. x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.07) \u2248 0.000998, which is approximately 0.001, but since 0.000998 is less than 0.001, it's within the interval. Similarly, n=3183 gives x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.03) \u2248 0.0000999996, which is just above 0.0001, so that's also within the interval.

Calculating 1/0.0001, that's 10000. So, 10000 > n\u03c0, which implies n < 10000/\u03c0. Similarly, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.

Taking reciprocals: 1/0.0001 = 10000 and 1/0.001 = 1000, so n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which leads to n being between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0. Calculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3099 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0989. Since n must be an integer, the smallest integer greater than 318.3099 is 319, and the largest integer less than 3183.0989 is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1, so 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct.

Similarly, 1000 / \u03c0 is approximately 318.3098862, so the minimum integer n is 319. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more, which is 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, yes, that seems correct.

Since n has to be an integer, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183. Now, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, no, actually, if I have integers from a to b inclusive, the count is b - a + 1. So here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in (0.0001, 0.001).

So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Now, the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865.

Which is 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, I get n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.14159265, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 10000 / 3.14159265 \u2248 3183.098. So, n < approximately 3183.098.

Calculating 1/0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, I get n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n < approximately 3183.09886184.

To find the number of integers from a to b inclusive, it's b - a + 1. So, plugging in the numbers: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319 first. 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, that's correct. So, there are 2865 integer values of n in this range, which would correspond to 2865 x-intercepts in the given interval. Wait a minute, let me think again. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0 because 1/x becomes very large. So, between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a very small interval near zero, the function will oscillate rapidly, crossing the x-axis many times. But does each integer n in this range correspond to exactly one x-intercept? Yes, because each n gives a unique x = 1/(n\u03c0), and each x lies within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, each n from 319 to 3183 inclusive gives a valid x-intercept in that interval. Therefore, the total number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me check if 1/(319\u03c0) is greater than 0.001 and 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001. Let me compute 1/(319\u03c0). 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.14159265 \u2248 319 * 3.14159265 \u2248 Let's compute 300*3.14159265 = 942.477795, and 19*3.14159265 \u2248 59.69026035, so total \u2248 942.477795 + 59.69026035 \u2248 1002.168055. So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.168055 \u2248 0.0009978, which is approximately 0.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Similarly, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.14159265) \u2248 1/(10000) \u2248 0.0001, but let me compute more accurately. 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 Let me compute 3000*3.14159265 = 9424.77795, and 183*3.14159265 \u2248 Let's compute 100*3.14159265 = 314.159265, 80*3.14159265 \u2248 251.327412, and 3*3.14159265 \u2248 9.42477795. Adding those together: 314.159265 + 251.327412 = 565.486677, plus 9.42477795 \u2248 574.91145495. So total 3183*\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77795 + 574.91145495 \u2248 10,000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10,000 = 0.0001. But since 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10,000 (because \u03c0 is approximately 3.14159265, so 3183*3.14159265 is exactly 10,000 when n is 3183.09886184, so 3183\u03c0 is slightly less than 10,000, meaning 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly more than 0.0001. Wait, that would mean that 1/(3183\u03c0) is just above 0.0001, so x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is just above 0.0001, which is within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n can be 319 up to 3183, inclusive, giving 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 x-intercepts.

Similarly, the second inequality is 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which gives n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, so n\u03c0 > 1000. So, putting these together: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Now, dividing all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184.

Since n has to be an integer, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183. Now, to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is given by b - a + 1. So, substituting, we get 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. I started by setting sin(1/x) = 0, which gives 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). Then, I substituted x into the interval (0.0001, 0.001) and solved for n, getting n between 319 and 3183. Then, the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive is 2865. That seems correct. Hmm, but just to be thorough, let me check the endpoints. For n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.3) \u2248 0.0009977, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. For n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) = 0.0001, but wait, the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, x = 0.0001 is not included, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but actually, let me compute it more accurately. 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77, 183\u03c0 \u2248 574.73, so total is approximately 9424.77 + 574.73 = 10,000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since the interval is open at 0.0001, x must be greater than 0.0001, so n must be less than 3183.09886184. So, n can be up to 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is not included. So, actually, n can only go up to 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) would be slightly larger than 0.0001. Wait, that changes things. Let me recast this. The original inequalities were 0.0001 < x < 0.001, so substituting x = 1/(n\u03c0), we have 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184. So, n must be an integer satisfying 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183, but wait, 3183 is less than 3183.09886184, so 3183 is included? Wait, no, because 3183 is less than 3183.09886184, so 3183 is allowed. But wait, when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but the interval is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001, so n must be less than 3183.09886184, meaning n can be up to 3183, but does 3183\u03c0 equal exactly 10,000? Let me check: 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let's compute 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796077, and 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 574.7305882. Adding these together: 9424.77796077 + 574.7305882 \u2248 10,000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), x must be greater than 0.0001, so n must be less than 3183.09886184, which means n can be up to 3183, but when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is not included. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so n can be up to 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. Wait, let me think again. If n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so n must be such that x > 0.0001, which means n < 3183.09886184. So, n can be up to 3183, but since 3183 is less than 3183.09886184, n = 3183 is allowed? Wait, no. Because if n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is not greater than 0.0001, it's equal. So, n must be less than 3183.09886184, meaning the maximum integer n is 3183, but since 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, which gives x = 0.0001, which is excluded, so n must be less than 3183.09886184, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but n = 3183 gives x = 0.0001, which is not in the interval. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. Wait, but 3183 is less than 3183.09886184, so n can be 3183, but x would be 0.0001, which is excluded. So, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so n can be up to 3183, but n = 3183 gives x = 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, n can only go up to 3182. Let me check: For n = 3182, x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10,000 - (3183\u03c0 - 10,000)) which is approximately 1/(10,000 - 0) \u2248 0.0001, but slightly more. So, x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010003, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, n can be from 319 up to 3182, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, which is correct? Let me re-examine. The initial calculation gave me n from 319 to 3183, which is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. But upon realizing that n = 3183 gives x = 0.0001, which is excluded, I need to adjust the upper limit to 3182, making the count 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. So, the correct number is 2864. Hmm, but let me confirm this with another approach. The number of zeros of sin(1/x) in (a, b) is equal to the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (a, b). So, for a = 0.0001 and b = 0.001, we have 1/(n\u03c0) > a => n < 1/(a\u03c0) \u2248 3183.09886184, and 1/(n\u03c0) < b => n > 1/(b\u03c0) \u2248 318.309886184. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183, but since n must be less than 3183.09886184, the maximum n is 3183, but as we saw, n = 3183 gives x = 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, n goes up to 3182. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. Alternatively, sometimes when dealing with inequalities, it's easier to compute the number of n's as floor(upper) - ceil(lower) + 1. So, upper is 3183.09886184, so floor(upper) = 3183. Lower is 318.309886184, so ceil(lower) = 319. So, number of n's is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. But wait, this seems contradictory. The issue is whether n = 3183 is included or not. Since x must be greater than 0.0001, and n = 3183 gives x = 0.0001, which is excluded, so n = 3183 is not allowed. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, so the count is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. But using the floor and ceil method, we get 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865, which includes n = 3183, which is invalid. So, to resolve this, perhaps the correct count is 2864. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that n can be up to floor(upper_bound - \u03b5), where \u03b5 is a small positive number, so n_max = floor(3183.09886184 - \u03b5) = 3183, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so n can be up to 3183, but n = 3183 gives x = 0.0001, which is excluded, so n_max = 3182. Therefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. So, I think the correct answer is 2864. But wait, let me check with specific values. Let's compute n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10,000) = 0.0001, which is excluded. So, n = 3183 is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, which is correct? Let me think again. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. Here, a = 319, b = 3182. So, 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. Therefore, 2864 is correct. Alternatively, if I consider that n starts at 319 and ends at 3182, the number of terms is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. So, the answer should be 2864. But wait, let me cross-verify with another approach. The function sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. The number of oscillations between x = a and x = b is approximately (1/(2\u03c0))(1/a - 1/b). Wait, is that right? Let me recall that the number of zeros of sin(1/x) between x = a and x = b is approximately (1/(2\u03c0))(1/a - 1/b). So, plugging in a = 0.0001 and b = 0.001, we get (1/(2\u03c0))(1/0.0001 - 1/0.001) = (1/(2\u03c0))(10000 - 1000) = (1/(2\u03c0))(9000) \u2248 9000/(6.283185307) \u2248 1432.393. Hmm, but that's about 1432 zeros, which is way less than 2864. So, that's a discrepancy. Wait, why is there such a difference? Let me think. The formula I recalled is for the number of zeros between x = a and x = b, which is indeed approximately (1/(2\u03c0))(1/a - 1/b). But in our case, a = 0.0001 and b = 0.001. So, 1/a = 10000, 1/b = 1000. So, 1/a - 1/b = 9000. Then, divided by 2\u03c0 gives approximately 9000/(6.283185307) \u2248 1432.393. So, about 1432 zeros. But according to our previous calculation, we have 2864 zeros. There's a factor of 2 difference. Why? Because each period of sin(1/x) has two zeros: one when sin(\u03b8) = 0 going up, and one going down. Wait, no, actually, sin(\u03b8) = 0 at \u03b8 = n\u03c0, but each zero crossing is a single point. Wait, no, actually, in the function sin(1/x), each oscillation from 0 to \u03c0 to 2\u03c0 corresponds to a certain number of zeros. Wait, perhaps the formula I recalled counts the number of periods, and each period has two zeros. Wait, no, sin(\u03b8) crosses zero once every \u03c0 interval, not every 2\u03c0. Wait, sin(\u03b8) is zero at \u03b8 = 0, \u03c0, 2\u03c0, etc., so each zero is spaced by \u03c0. So, the number of zeros between \u03b8 = a and \u03b8 = b is approximately (b - a)/\u03c0. In our case, \u03b8 = 1/x, so when x goes from a to b, \u03b8 goes from 1/a to 1/b. So, the number of zeros is approximately (1/b - 1/a)/\u03c0. Wait, that would be (1000 - 10000)/\u03c0 = (-9000)/\u03c0 \u2248 -2866.197, but since we take the absolute value, it's 2866.197, which is approximately 2866. That matches our earlier count of 2864, considering rounding errors. So, that makes sense. Therefore, the correct number is approximately 2866, but since we're dealing with exact integers, it's 2864. Wait, but according to the formula, it's (1/b - 1/a)/\u03c0 = (1000 - 10000)/\u03c0 = -9000/\u03c0 \u2248 -2866.197, but the number of zeros is the number of times sin(\u03b8) crosses zero as \u03b8 decreases from 1/a to 1/b, which is the same as the number of zeros in \u03b8 from 10000 to 1000, which is (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 \u2248 9000/3.1415926535 \u2248 2866.197. So, approximately 2866 zeros. But in our earlier calculation, we got 2864. So, there's a slight discrepancy due to the fact that we're dealing with open intervals and exact integer counts. Let me think about it. The exact number is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0). So, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so floor(10000/\u03c0) = 3183. 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so ceil(1000/\u03c0) = 319. Therefore, the number of zeros is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but earlier I thought n goes up to 3182, but according to this, it's 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, which is correct? Let me clarify: The number of integers n such that 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184 is equal to floor(3183.09886184) - ceil(318.309886184) + 1 = 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. However, since x must be greater than 0.0001, which corresponds to n < 3183.09886184, so n can be up to 3183, but n = 3183 gives x = 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so the maximum n is 3183, but n = 3183 is excluded, so the maximum n is 3182. Therefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. So, the correct answer is 2864. But wait, let me check with specific numbers. Let me compute n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.3) \u2248 0.0009977, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. n = 3182: x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10,000 - 3183\u03c0 + 3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10,000 - \u03c0) \u2248 1/9999 \u2248 0.00010001, which is greater than 0.0001, so included. n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded. So, n goes from 319 to 3182, inclusive. Therefore, the number of terms is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. So, the answer is 2864. But wait, let me check with the formula again. The number of zeros is approximately (1/a - 1/b)/\u03c0 = (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 \u2248 9000/3.1415926535 \u2248 2866.197. So, approximately 2866 zeros. But since we're dealing with exact integers, the exact count is 2864. The difference is due to the open interval excluding the endpoints, which removes two potential zeros. So, I think 2864 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, leading to x = 1/(n\u03c0). For x in (0.0001, 0.001), we find n ranges from 319 to 3182, giving 2864 intercepts.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}."

Taking reciprocals on both sides (and remembering that flipping inequalities when taking reciprocals since both sides are positive), we get: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0, which is 10000 > n\u03c0. Similarly, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals again, we get: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is n\u03c0 > 1000. So now, we have 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute those values. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, n can take integer values from the next integer greater than 318.309886184, which is 319, up to the integer less than 3183.09886184, which is 3183. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range, inclusive. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is given by b - a + 1. So, plugging in the values: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, the substitution: 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). Then, 0.0001 < x < 0.001 translates to 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals, 10000 > n\u03c0 > 1000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. Number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. Yep, that seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's the answer. It's a lot of intercepts because as x approaches zero, 1/x becomes very large, causing sin(1/x) to oscillate rapidly, hence many zeros in a small interval. But since we're only considering up to 0.001, which is still a small number, but not too close to zero, the number of intercepts is still large but finite.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0. This occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer n. We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Solving for n gives 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183, resulting in 2865 integers.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

Taking reciprocals on both sides (and remembering that reversing the inequality when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive), we get: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Calculating 1/0.0001, that's 10000. So, 10000 > n\u03c0, which implies n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. Since n must be an integer, n must be less than 3183.0988618, so n \u2264 3183. Now, let's take the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001. 1/0.001 is 1000, so n\u03c0 > 1000. Therefore, n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. Since n must be an integer, n must be greater than 318.30988618, so n \u2265 319. So, putting it all together, n must be an integer such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, no, actually, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Each of these n corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, the number of x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2865. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me re-calculate the number of integers from 319 to 3183. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, and then adding 1 gives 2865. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of it as starting from n=1 up to n=3183, which is 3183 numbers, and then subtracting the numbers from n=1 to n=318, which is 318 numbers. So, 3183 - 318 = 2865. Yep, that matches. So, I think 2865 is the correct number of x-intercepts. Just to make sure, let me think about the behavior of the function y = sin(1/x) near x=0. As x approaches 0 from the positive side, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly between -1 and 1. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is close to zero, the function is oscillating very rapidly, and each oscillation crosses the x-axis twice (once going up, once going down). Wait, but in my calculation above, I only counted the zeros where 1/x = n\u03c0, which would be every \u03c0 interval in \u03b8. But actually, sin(\u03b8) is zero at \u03b8 = n\u03c0, but between each \u03b8 = n\u03c0 and \u03b8 = (n+1)\u03c0, there's a peak or a trough, so each zero crossing is either at n\u03c0 or (n+1)\u03c0, but for the function sin(\u03b8), each zero crossing is a single point. Wait, no, actually, between \u03b8 = n\u03c0 and \u03b8 = (n+1)\u03c0, the sine function goes from 0 up to 1 and back to 0, or from 0 down to -1 and back to 0, so each interval of \u03c0 in \u03b8 corresponds to one zero crossing. So, each n corresponds to one zero. So, perhaps my initial calculation is correct, that each n gives one zero crossing. So, the number of zeros is equal to the number of n's, which is 2865. Wait, but wait, let me think again. For example, when \u03b8 increases by \u03c0, the sine function goes from 0 to 0, passing through 1 or -1. So, each n corresponds to one zero. So, the number of zeros in \u03b8 between a and b is roughly (b - a)/\u03c0. But in our case, \u03b8 = 1/x, so when x is in (0.0001, 0.001), \u03b8 is in (1000, 10000). So, \u03b8 ranges from 1000 to 10000. So, the number of zeros should be approximately (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 = 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866. But in my earlier calculation, I got 2865. Hmm, that's very close. The difference is likely due to whether we include both endpoints or not. Let me check: when \u03b8 = 1000, is that included? Our x is greater than 0.0001, so \u03b8 = 1/x < 10000, and x < 0.001, so \u03b8 > 1000. So, \u03b8 is in (1000, 10000). So, the number of zeros is the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 in that interval. So, the smallest n where n\u03c0 > 1000 is n = 319, as before, because 318\u03c0 \u2248 1000. So, 318\u03c0 \u2248 1000, so n=319 gives 319\u03c0 \u2248 1000 + \u03c0, which is greater than 1000. Similarly, the largest n where n\u03c0 < 10000 is n=3183, since 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000. So, the number of n's is 3183 - 318 = 2865. But when I calculate (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 \u2248 9000/3.14159 \u2248 2866.17. So, approximately 2866. But since n must be integer, and we're counting from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 2865 numbers, that's correct. So, the exact number is 2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). To find the intercepts in (0.0001, 0.001), we solve 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, leading to 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. The number of integers in this range is 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that flipping the inequality when taking reciprocals (since both sides are positive), I get: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0, which simplifies to 10000 > n\u03c0. Similarly, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals again, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is n\u03c0 > 1000. So now, combining these two results: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926536. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926536 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926536 \u2248 3183.09886184. Now, since n has to be an integer, n must satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Because 318.309... is just a bit more than 318, so the next integer is 319, and 3183.098... is just a bit more than 3183, so the maximum integer n is 3183. Now, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, actually, the number of integers between a and b inclusive is b - a + 1. But here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. I started by setting sin(1/x) = 0, which leads to 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). Then, I substituted into the interval and solved for n, finding that n must be between approximately 318.31 and 3183.09. Since n must be an integer, I took the ceiling of the lower bound (319) and the floor of the upper bound (3183). Then, the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1, which is 2865. That seems correct.

    "text": " 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides (and remember that reversing the inequality when taking reciprocals), I get: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0, which is 10000 > n\u03c0. Similarly, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals again, I get: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is n\u03c0 > 1000. So now I have two inequalities: n\u03c0 > 1000 and n\u03c0 < 10000. Let me write them as: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. To find n, I can divide all parts by \u03c0. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating the numerical values, since \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. Let me compute 1000/\u03c0: 1000 \u00f7 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be an integer strictly greater than 318.309886184 and strictly less than 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319, and the largest possible n is 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, applying that here: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 1000/\u03c0 is approximately 318.31, so the next integer is 319. 10000/\u03c0 is approximately 3183.098, so the integer part is 3183. Then, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. That seems correct. Hmm, but wait, I should confirm whether x = 1/(n\u03c0) is strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. Let me check for n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.18) \u2248 0.0009968, which is approximately 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001. For n = 318: x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(999.21) \u2248 0.0010008, which is greater than 0.001, so n=318 is too small, hence n starts at 319. Similarly, for n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0003) \u2248 0.000099999, which is just above 0.0001. Wait, 0.000099999 is 9.9999e-5, which is less than 0.0001, so actually, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. Therefore, n=3183 would give x just below 0.0001, which is not in our interval. So, perhaps n should be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but let me check x for n=3183: 1/(3183 * \u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000.0003) \u2248 0.000099999, which is 0.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 gives x just below 0.0001, which is outside the interval. So, the maximum n should be such that x is greater than 0.0001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, n < 1/(0.0001 * \u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183. But when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. Let me check n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(9996.999) \u2248 0.00010003, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included. So, n can go up to 3182. Therefore, the range of n is from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Now, let's compute the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Using the formula: 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. Wait, that contradicts my earlier calculation. Hmm, so I think I made a mistake earlier by including n=3183, but actually, n=3183 gives x less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the correct upper bound is n=3182. So, the number of integers is from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, 3182 - 319 + 1 = 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but let me check again. Let me compute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, 2882 - 19 = 2863, so 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider whether the endpoints are included or not. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. So, for n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. For n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010003, which is greater than 0.0001, so included. But n=3183 gives x \u2248 0.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so excluded. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182, inclusive. So, number of terms is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Hmm, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, which is correct? Let me check with a smaller example to see if my formula is correct. Suppose I have integers from a to b inclusive. The number of integers is b - a + 1. For example, from 1 to 3 inclusive: 3 -1 +1 = 3, which is correct (1,2,3). So, in our case, from 319 to 3182 inclusive, it's 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864. Therefore, the correct number is 2864. So, earlier I had 2865 because I included n=3183, which was incorrect. So, the correct number is 2864. Therefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2864 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial substitution. So, starting from sin(1/x) = 0, which implies 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, x must be in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and flipping inequalities): 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184. Therefore, n can be integers from 319 up to 3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864. So, that's correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integers n. Solving for x gives x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to the inequality 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. This simplifies to 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so n ranges from 319 to 3182. The number of integers in this range is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}."

Calculating 1/0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, we get n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is about 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. Since n has to be an integer, n must be less than or equal to 3183. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n\u03c0 > 1000. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. Since n must be an integer, n must be greater than or equal to 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the numbers: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then +1 is 2865. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. So, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, 2865 x-intercepts. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. So, when x is in (0.0001, 0.001), 1/x is in (1000, 10000). So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. So, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0. So, 1/x = n\u03c0, which gives x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Which, as I did before, gives 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.30988618 < n < 3183.0988618. So, n can be 319, 320, ..., up to 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but let me think again: when n increases, x decreases because x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, as n goes from 319 to 3183, x goes from 1/(319\u03c0) to 1/(3183\u03c0). Let me check if 1/(319\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001 and 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.001. 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(319 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(1003.11) \u2248 0.0009968, which is just under 0.001, but wait, that can't be right because 1/(319\u03c0) should be less than 0.001. Wait, no, 1/(319\u03c0) is approximately 1/1003 \u2248 0.000997, which is just under 0.001, so that's correct. Similarly, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, but actually, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001 when n=3183, but since our interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), we need to check if 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Wait, 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001. But since \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, 3183 * \u03c0 = 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute that: 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 574.54384, so total is approximately 9424.77796 + 574.54384 \u2248 9999.3218. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.3218, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.3218 \u2248 0.0001000067. Wait, that's just over 0.0001. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000067, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1003.11 \u2248 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, n=319 gives x\u22480.0009968, which is less than 0.001, and n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001000067, which is just above 0.0001. So, both endpoints are included. Therefore, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but let me confirm that calculation again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 is 2865. So, 2865 x-intercepts. But let me think if there's any possibility that n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) which is just over 0.0001, so it's included, and n=319 gives x\u22480.0009968, which is less than 0.001, so included as well. Therefore, the total number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need to find x in (0.0001, 0.001), which translates to 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Solving for n gives 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183, resulting in 2865 x-intercepts.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

Taking reciprocals on both sides (and remembering that taking reciprocals reverses the inequality for positive numbers), I get: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0, which is 10000 > n\u03c0. So, n < 10000/\u03c0. Similarly, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals again: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Now, let's compute 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.3098861. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.098861. Since n has to be an integer, n must be greater than approximately 318.3098861 and less than approximately 3183.098861. So, n can take integer values starting from the next integer after 318.3098861, which is 319, up to the integer just below 3183.098861, which is 3183. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers in this range, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Each of these n corresponds to an x-intercept in the given interval. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31, so the first integer n is 319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so the last integer n is 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more to get 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait a second, let me think again. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches zero. So, between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a small interval near zero, the function will have a lot of oscillations. Each oscillation corresponds to a peak and a trough, so each full cycle would have two x-intercepts: one when sin goes from positive to zero, and another when it goes from negative to zero. But in this case, we're only counting the zeros, so each n corresponds to a zero crossing. But wait, in the equation sin(1/x) = 0, each n gives a distinct x, so each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept. So, the number of zeros is equal to the number of n's in that range, which is 2865. Hmm, that seems like a lot, but considering the interval is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is 0.0009 in length, and the function oscillates rapidly there, it's plausible. Let me just check if I did the reciprocal correctly. So, x is between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0. So, 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, x must be between 0.0001 and 0.001, so 1/(n\u03c0) must be between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, 1000 \u2264 n\u03c0 \u2264 10000. Therefore, 1000/\u03c0 \u2264 n \u2264 10000/\u03c0, which is what I had before. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct.

Since n is an integer, n \u2264 3183. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, we get: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001 = 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.3098861. Since n must be an integer greater than this value, n \u2265 319. So, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to count how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is given by b - a + 1. So, substituting a = 319 and b = 3183, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, 1/0.0001 is indeed 10000, and 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.098861, so n must be less than that, so n = 1 to 3183. But wait, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which gives n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098861. So, n must be at least 319. So, the range of n is from 319 to 3183. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2865. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. This gives x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nSolving for n:\n\n10000 > n\u03c0 \u21d2 n < 3183.098861\n\nand\n\nn\u03c0 > 1000 \u21d2 n > 318.3098861\n\nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

    "text": " 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Taking reciprocals on both sides (and remembering that reversing the inequality when taking reciprocals), we get: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0, which simplifies to 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0: 10000/\u03c0 > n. Similarly, for the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals again: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is n\u03c0 > 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Let me calculate the numerical values to make it clearer. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. And 1000 divided by \u03c0 is about 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. So, putting it together, n must satisfy: 318.30988618 < n < 3183.0988618. But n has to be an integer because x-intercepts occur at integer multiples of \u03c0 in the argument of the sine function. So, n must be integers greater than 318.30988618 and less than 3183.0988618. Therefore, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183. Now, to find how many integers are in this range from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add one (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. 3183 minus 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive, each corresponding to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2865. Wait, but let me think again. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001). So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, when x approaches 0.0001 from the right, 1/x approaches 10000, and as x approaches 0.001 from the left, 1/x approaches 1000. So, the values of \u03b8 = 1/x range from just above 1000 to just below 10000. So, \u03b8 is between 1000 and 10000. Now, sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 is an integer multiple of \u03c0, so the zeros occur at \u03b8 = n\u03c0 where n is an integer. So, the smallest \u03b8 in the interval is just above 1000, and the largest is just below 10000. So, the smallest n such that n\u03c0 > 1000 is n = floor(1000/\u03c0) + 1. Similarly, the largest n such that n\u03c0 < 10000 is n = floor(10000/\u03c0). Let me compute these.\n\nFirst, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, so the smallest integer n is 319.\n\n10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618, so the largest integer n is 3183.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865.\n\nWait, but I just want to make sure that each n from 319 to 3183 corresponds to exactly one x in (0.0001, 0.001). Since each x is 1/(n\u03c0), and as n increases, x decreases. So, when n increases by 1, x decreases by a small amount. So, each n in that range will give a unique x in the interval. Therefore, the total number is indeed 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check if n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0). Let me compute 319\u03c0: 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 319 * 3 = 957, 319 * 0.1416 \u2248 319 * 0.14 \u2248 44.66, so total \u2248 957 + 44.66 \u2248 1001.66. So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1001.66 \u2248 0.0009983, which is just below 0.001. Wait, but our interval is up to 0.001, but it's exclusive, so x must be less than 0.001. So, 0.0009983 is less than 0.001, so that's okay.\n\nSimilarly, n=3183: 3183\u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77, and 183\u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.1416 \u2248 575. So, total \u2248 9424.77 + 575 \u2248 10,000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000. So, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10,000 = 0.0001. But our interval is x > 0.0001, so x=0.0001 is excluded. Therefore, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but it's excluded. Therefore, perhaps n=3183 is not included? Wait, but earlier I thought the upper bound was 3183.0988618, so n=3183 is the largest integer less than that. So, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is just above 0.0001, right?\n\nWait, let me compute 3183\u03c0 more accurately. Let's compute 3183 * \u03c0.\n\n\u03c0 \u2248 3.1415926535.\n\n3183 * 3 = 9549.\n\n3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3\n\n3183 * 0.0415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32\n\n3183 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 Approximately 3183 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0928\n\nSo, adding up: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.0928 \u2248 450.7128\n\nSo, total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9549 + 450.7128 \u2248 10,000.7128\n\nWait, that can't be right because 3183 * \u03c0 is approximately 10,000.71, which is more than 10,000. But earlier, we had \u03b8 = 1/x, and \u03b8 must be less than 10,000 because x > 0.0001. So, \u03b8 = 1/x < 10,000.\n\nWait, but if n=3183, then \u03b8 = n\u03c0 \u2248 10,000.71, which is greater than 10,000. So, 1/x = 10,000.71 implies x \u2248 1/10,000.71 \u2248 0.0000999929, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999929, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the largest n such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3183 would give x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999929 < 0.0001, which is excluded. So, we need the largest n such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10,000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, the largest integer n is 3183, but as we saw, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999929 < 0.0001, so it's not in the interval. Therefore, the largest n such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3182, because 3182\u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535.\n\nLet me compute 3182 * \u03c0:\n\n3182 * 3 = 9546\n\n3182 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3182 * 0.1 = 318.2\n\n3182 * 0.0415926535 \u2248 3182 * 0.04 = 127.28\n\n3182 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 Approximately 3182 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0912\n\nSo, adding up: 318.2 + 127.28 = 445.48 + 5.0912 \u2248 450.5712\n\nSo, total 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9546 + 450.5712 \u2248 9996.5712\n\nSo, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.5712 \u2248 0.000100034, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n=3182 gives x\u22480.000100034, which is in the interval. Therefore, the largest n is 3182.\n\nSimilarly, the smallest n is 319, as before.\n\nSo, now the range of n is from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864.\n\nWait, so earlier I had 2865, but now I have 2864. Which is correct?\n\nWait, let me recast this.\n\nWe have n starting at 319 and ending at 3182.\n\nThe number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1.\n\nSo, 3182 - 319 + 1 = 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864.\n\nSo, the correct number is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n=3183 was excluded because x=1/(3183\u03c0) was below 0.0001, so the largest n is 3182. Therefore, the count is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nSo, that would mean the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial calculation by including n=3183, which actually gives x outside the interval.\n\nTherefore, the correct count is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, the number of zeros of sin(1/x) in (a, b) is equal to the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (a, b). So, a < 1/(n\u03c0) < b.\n\nWhich is equivalent to 1/(b) < n\u03c0 < 1/a.\n\nDividing by \u03c0: 1/(b\u03c0) < n < 1/(a\u03c0).\n\nSo, n must be integers between 1/(b\u03c0) and 1/(a\u03c0).\n\nGiven a=0.0001 and b=0.001,\n\n1/(b\u03c0) = 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618\n\n1/(a\u03c0) = 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618\n\nSo, n must satisfy 318.30988618 < n < 3183.0988618.\n\nThus, n can be integers from 319 up to 3183.\n\nBut wait, earlier we saw that n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999929, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded.\n\nTherefore, the upper limit for n is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100034, which is greater than 0.0001.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nNumber of integers: 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with specific values.\n\nFor n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1001.66) \u2248 0.0009983, which is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nFor n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.57 \u2248 0.000100034, which is greater than 0.0001, so included.\n\nFor n=3183: x\u22480.0000999929 < 0.0001, excluded.\n\nSo, the number of n's is from 319 to 3182, which is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought it was 2865, but now I'm getting 2864. Let me see: the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation.\n\nCompute 3182 - 319:\n\n3182 - 300 = 2882\n\n2882 - 19 = 2863\n\nThen 2863 + 1 = 2864.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integers n. This gives x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001  \n=> 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000  \n=> 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098\n\nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3182, inclusive.

Then, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001: n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n = 319, 320, ..., 3183. The number of terms from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. Yep, that seems correct.

Calculating 1/0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, I get n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n is an integer, n \u2264 3183. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n\u03c0 > 1000. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, n > 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618. Since n is an integer, n \u2265 319. So, putting it all together, n must satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Now, I need to count the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, applying that here: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Each of these n corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait a second, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, starting from the inequalities: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals: 10000 > n\u03c0 > 1000. Dividing by \u03c0: 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618, and 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. That seems correct. So, I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, or 318.31 < n < 3183.09. Thus, n ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

    "text": " 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, the inequality will reverse because I'm dealing with positive numbers. So, 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Calculating 1/0.0001, that's 10,000. So, 10,000 > n\u03c0, which means n < 10,000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10,000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 10,000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.098861. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.098861. Since n is an integer, n \u2264 3183. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, which reverses the inequality: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001. 1/0.001 is 1000, so n\u03c0 > 1000, which means n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.3098861. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.3098861. Since n is an integer, n \u2265 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers inclusive, we subtract the smaller from the larger and add 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there should be 2865 x-intercepts in the given interval. Wait, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes when dealing with inequalities, especially with reciprocals, it's easy to make a mistake. So, starting again: The function is sin(1/x). We set sin(1/x) = 0, which implies 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let's solve for n in each inequality.\n\nFirst inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Multiply both sides by n\u03c0: 0.0001 * n\u03c0 < 1. Then, n < 1 / (0.0001 * \u03c0). 0.0001 is 1e-4, so 1 / (1e-4 * \u03c0) = 10,000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.098861. So, n < 3183.098861, so n \u2264 3183.\n\nSecond inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Multiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0. Then, n > 1 / (0.001 * \u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.3098861. So, n \u2265 319.\n\nSo, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me consider whether n can be zero or negative. But in this case, since x is in (0.0001, 0.001), which is positive, and 1/x is positive, so n must be positive integers because 1/x is positive, so n\u03c0 is positive, so n is positive. So, n starts at 1, but in our case, n starts at 319 because 1/(n\u03c0) must be less than 0.001, which requires n to be at least 319. So, n cannot be zero or negative, so we don't have to consider those.\n\nAnother point to check: Does each n in 319 to 3183 correspond to a unique x in (0.0001, 0.001)? Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), as n increases, x decreases. So, as n goes from 319 to 3183, x goes from approximately 1/(319\u03c0) to 1/(3183\u03c0). Let me compute those to ensure they fall within (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nCompute 1/(319\u03c0): \u03c0 \u2248 3.1416, so 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's compute 300*3.1416=942.48, 19*3.1416\u224859.6904, so total \u2248 942.48 + 59.6904 \u2248 1002.1704. So, 1/1002.1704 \u2248 0.0009978, which is approximately 0.001, but slightly less. Wait, but our upper limit is 0.001, so 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval.\n\nSimilarly, 1/(3183\u03c0): 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's compute 3000*3.1416=9424.8, 183*3.1416\u2248575.0448, so total \u2248 9424.8 + 575.0448 \u2248 9999.8448. So, 1/9999.8448 \u2248 0.0001000016, which is just above 0.0001. So, that's within the interval as well.\n\nSo, n=319 gives x\u22480.0009978, which is within (0.0001, 0.001), and n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001000016, which is just above 0.0001, so also within the interval. So, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive correspond to x in (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but let me check if n=3183 is included. Since 1/(3183\u03c0) \u22480.0001000016, which is greater than 0.0001, so it is included. Similarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so included.\n\nNow, another thing to consider: Are there any gaps or overlaps? Since each n gives a unique x, and as n increases by 1, x decreases by a small amount, so each x is unique and falls within the interval. So, each n from 319 to 3183 corresponds to exactly one x-intercept in the interval.\n\nSo, the total number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me compute 3183 - 319 again to make sure. 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. Yep, that's correct.\n\nWait, but hold on, I just realized something. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches zero. But in our case, the interval is from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is very close to zero. So, the function sin(1/x) will have a lot of oscillations in this interval. Each time 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0, we get an x-intercept. So, the number of x-intercepts should correspond to how many times 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0 as x moves from 0.001 down to 0.0001.\n\nBut wait, when x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001, 1/x increases from 1000 to 10,000. So, 1/x moves from 1000 to 10,000, and each time it crosses a multiple of \u03c0, we get an x-intercept. So, the number of multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10,000 is the number of x-intercepts.\n\nWait, that seems different from my earlier approach. Let me think again. If 1/x moves from 1000 to 10,000 as x goes from 0.001 to 0.0001, then the number of times sin(1/x) crosses zero is the number of integers n such that n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10,000. So, n must satisfy 1000 \u2264 n\u03c0 \u2264 10,000. So, n must be between 1000/\u03c0 and 10,000/\u03c0, which is the same as before: n \u2265 319 and n \u2264 3183. So, the number of integers n is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that's consistent with my earlier result.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should consider whether the endpoints are included or not. The interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. So, 1/x cannot be exactly 10,000 or 1000. Therefore, n\u03c0 cannot be exactly 10,000 or 1000. So, when n=319, 319\u03c0 \u2248 1002.17, which is greater than 1000, so x=1/(319\u03c0) \u22480.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Similarly, n=3183, 3183\u03c0\u22489999.8448, which is less than 10,000, so x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001000016, which is greater than 0.0001, so included. Therefore, all n from 319 to 3183 correspond to x in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, the count remains 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check if n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so yes, it's in the interval. Similarly, n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001000016, which is just above 0.0001, so included.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again: When dealing with the function sin(1/x), as x approaches zero from the positive side, 1/x approaches infinity, and sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. But in our case, we're only looking between x=0.0001 and x=0.001, which is a finite interval, so the number of oscillations is finite, and we've calculated the number of zeros as 2865.\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't make a miscalculation in the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the formula is: number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Let me compute 3183 - 319:\n\n3183 - 300 = 2883\n\n2883 - 19 = 2864\n\nThen, 2864 + 1 = 2865. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the number of integers from 1 to 3183 is 3183, and the number of integers from 1 to 318 is 318. So, the number from 319 to 3183 is 3183 - 318 = 2865. That also works.\n\nSo, I think I've confirmed it multiple ways. The number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check with a smaller example to see if my method works. Suppose I wanted to find the number of x-intercepts of sin(1/x) in the interval (0.1, 0.2). So, 0.1 < x < 0.2, which implies 5 < 1/x < 10. So, 1/x is between 5 and 10. So, sin(1/x)=0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so n\u03c0 must be between 5 and 10. So, n must satisfy 5/\u03c0 < n < 10/\u03c0. Calculating, 5/\u03c0 \u22481.5915, 10/\u03c0\u22483.1831. So, n can be 2 or 3. Therefore, the x-intercepts are at x=1/(2\u03c0)\u22480.15915 and x=1/(3\u03c0)\u22480.1061. Now, check if these x's are in (0.1, 0.2). 0.15915 is between 0.1 and 0.2, and 0.1061 is also between 0.1 and 0.2. So, there are two x-intercepts. Using my formula: n starts at 2 and ends at 3, so 3 - 2 + 1 = 2. Correct. So, the formula works in this case.\n\nSimilarly, if I take the interval (0.05, 0.1), then 1/x is between 10 and 20. So, n\u03c0 must be between 10 and 20. So, n must be between 10/\u03c0\u22483.1831 and 20/\u03c0\u22486.3662. So, n=4,5,6. That's 3 numbers. Using the formula: 6 - 4 + 1=3. Correct.\n\nSo, applying this to the original problem, the formula holds, so the answer should be 2865.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm once more. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so 1/x is between 1000 and 10,000. The number of n's where n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10,000. So, n_min=ceil(1000/\u03c0)=319, n_max=floor(10,000/\u03c0)=3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1=2865. Yep, that's correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

    "text": " 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Taking reciprocals on both sides (and remembering that this will reverse the inequality because both sides are positive), we get: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0 \u21d2 10000 > n\u03c0 \u21d2 n < 10000/\u03c0. Similarly, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u21d2 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 \u21d2 1000 < n\u03c0 \u21d2 n > 1000/\u03c0. So, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values numerically to find the range of n. First, 1000 divided by \u03c0. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000/3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000/3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, n can take integer values starting from the next integer after 318.309886184, which is 319, up to the integer just below 3183.09886184, which is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, and then adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n in this range. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. 3183 - 319 is 2864, right? Because 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more to get 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct. So, yeah, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I should compute 3183 - 319 + 1 more carefully. 3183 minus 319: Let's compute 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. Yep, that's correct. So, 2865 is the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check if n=319 and n=3183 are indeed within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Let's compute x for n=319: x = 1/(319\u03c0). Let me compute that. 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.14159265 \u2248 1003.5 (since 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477, and 19\u03c0 \u2248 59.690, so 942.477 + 59.690 \u2248 1002.167, so 319\u03c0 \u2248 1002.167). So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.167 \u2248 0.0009978, which is approximately 0.0009978, which is 0.0009978, which is just under 0.001, so it's within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, for n=3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0). Let's compute 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 Let's see, 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, and 183\u03c0 \u2248 575.019, so total is approximately 9424.77796 + 575.019 \u2248 10000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000, so x \u2248 1/10000 = 0.0001. But since 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000, x would be slightly less than 0.0001, which is 0.0001 exactly. But our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.0001, so x=0.0001 is not included. Therefore, n=3183 gives x \u2248 0.0001, but since it's open, maybe we need to check if n=3183 is included or not. Wait, n must satisfy x > 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n\u03c0 < 10000 \u21d2 n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.09886184, so the largest integer n is 3183, but wait, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since the interval is open at 0.0001, does x=1/(3183\u03c0) count? Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0). Since 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but let's compute it more accurately. Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0: 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 183\u03c0 \u2248 575.019, so total is 9424.77796 + 575.019 \u2248 10000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 exactly. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.0001, x=0.0001 is not included. Therefore, n=3183 would give x=0.0001, which is not in the interval, so we should exclude n=3183. Therefore, the upper limit for n is 3182. Wait, but earlier I thought n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so n must be less than 3183.09886184, so n can be up to 3183, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is not included. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is not included, so the maximum n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3182. Let me check: 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182 * 3.14159265) \u2248 1/(10000 - \u03c0) \u2248 approximately 0.00010001, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. So, n can go up to 3182. Therefore, the upper limit for n is 3182. Similarly, let's check n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3182. Therefore, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but now I'm getting 2864. Hmm, where did I go wrong? Let me re-examine.\n\nFirst, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184. So, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so n must go up to 3182. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863. Then, 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, 2864 integers. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but now I'm getting 2864. So, which one is correct? Let me check with a smaller example. Suppose I have numbers from a to b inclusive, the count is b - a + 1. So, if a=319 and b=3182, then the count is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 3182 - 319 is 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, that's correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that n=3183 is indeed excluded. Let's compute x=1/(3183\u03c0). Since \u03c0\u22483.14159265, 3183*3.14159265\u22483183*3.14159265. Let me compute 3000*3.14159265=9424.77795, 183*3.14159265\u2248575.0189, so total is 9424.77795 + 575.0189\u224810000. So, 3183\u03c0\u224810000, so 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001 exactly. Since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.0001, x=0.0001 is not included, so n=3183 is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. So, the number of x-intercepts is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. So, the correct answer is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n goes up to 3183, but upon checking, n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so the correct upper limit is n=3182. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0). Let's compute 3182*\u03c0\u22483182*3.14159265\u22483182*3=9546, 3182*0.14159265\u2248450. So, total\u22489546+450\u224810000. So, 3182\u03c0\u224810000 - \u03c0\u224810000 - 3.14159265\u22489996.8584. Therefore, 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22481/9996.8584\u22480.00010003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. So, n=3182 is included. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the count is correct. Let's take a smaller interval to test. Suppose I have n from 1 to 3 inclusive. The count is 3 numbers: 1,2,3. So, 3 - 1 + 1=3. Similarly, from 5 to 7 inclusive: 7-5 +1=3 numbers:5,6,7. So, the formula works. So, from 319 to 3182 inclusive, the count is 3182 - 319 +1=2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but after correcting for n=3183 being excluded, it's 2864. So, that's the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The initial approach was to find n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which translates to 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so n must be between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184. So, n can be 319,320,...,3183. But wait, 3183\u03c0\u224810000, so 1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001, which is excluded, so n=3183 is excluded. Therefore, n goes up to 3182. So, the number of n's is from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 +1=2864.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the number of zeros is the number of times sin(1/x) crosses zero as x moves from 0.001 down to 0.0001. Each zero crossing occurs at x=1/(n\u03c0). So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001). So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so n must be between 1000/\u03c0\u2248318.309886184 and 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.09886184. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so n ends at 3182. Therefore, the number of n's is 3182 - 319 +1=2864.\n\nWait, but let me compute 3182 - 319. 3182 - 300=2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 -19=2863, then add 1:2864. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as the number of integers between a and b exclusive. But in this case, the interval for n is (318.309886184, 3183.09886184). So, n must be greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184. So, the smallest integer n is 319, the largest integer n is 3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so the largest n is 3182.\n\nWait, but hold on, if n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, then n must be less than 3183.09886184, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but since x=1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001 is excluded, we have to take n up to 3182. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 +1=2864.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with a different approach. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches zero. The number of oscillations between x=a and x=b can be found by integrating the derivative, but perhaps that's overcomplicating it. Alternatively, the number of zeros is the number of times 1/x passes through multiples of \u03c0 as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001. So, each zero occurs at x=1/(n\u03c0), so the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which is the same as 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so n between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which is 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so n goes up to 3182. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3182 - 319 +1=2864.\n\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, after carefully considering and checking, I conclude that the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\). This occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for some integer \\( n \\), which implies \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n\nWe need \\( x \\) to satisfy \\( 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\). Taking reciprocals, we get:\n\\[ 1000 < n\\pi < 10000 \\]\n\nDividing by \\( \\pi \\) (approximately 3.1415926535), we find:\n\\[ \\frac{1000}{\\pi} \\approx 318.309886184 < n < \\frac{10000}{\\pi} \\approx 3183.09886184 \\]\n\nThus, \\( n \\) must be an integer in the range from 319 to 3182 (since \\( n = 3183 \\) gives \\( x = 0.0001 \\), which is excluded). The number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is calculated as:\n\\[ 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts is \\(\\boxed{2864}\\)."

    "text": " 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides (and reverse the inequality sign because reciprocals reverse inequalities for positive numbers), I get: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0, which is 10000 > n\u03c0. Similarly, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals again: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is n\u03c0 > 1000. So, putting both inequalities together: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Now, I can divide all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so let's compute the lower and upper bounds for n. Lower bound: 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Upper bound: 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n must satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. To find the number of integers from a to b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the numbers: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 1000 / \u03c0 is approximately 318.31, so the next integer is 319. 10000 / \u03c0 is approximately 3183.098, so the integer part is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of terms in this sequence is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then 2864 + 1 is 2865. Yep, that seems correct. So, I think the answer is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0. This occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing by \u03c0, we find n ranges from 319 to 3183. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

    "text": " 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Taking reciprocals (and remembering to reverse the inequality when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive), we get: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Calculating 1/0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0: n < 10000/\u03c0. Similarly, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals again: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values numerically. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535. Let me compute that: 10000 \u00f7 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n < approximately 3183.0988618. Since n has to be an integer, the maximum integer n can be is 3183. Now, for the lower bound: 1000 divided by \u03c0 is 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n > approximately 318.30988618. Since n has to be an integer, the smallest integer n can be is 319. Now, I need to find all integers n such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. To find the number of integers in this range, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add one (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Wait, that seems too high. Let me check my calculations again. Wait, 3183 - 319 is actually 2864, yes, and adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, but let me think again. If n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183, how many terms are there? Let me think of a smaller example: if n ranges from 1 to 5, the number of terms is 5 - 1 + 1 = 5, which is correct. So, applying that here, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that would mean there are 2865 x-intercepts. Wait, but that seems like a lot. Let me see if that makes sense. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches zero because 1/x becomes very large. So, between 0.0001 and 0.001, which are both very small, but 0.0001 is ten times smaller than 0.001, so the function should oscillate more between 0.0001 and 0.0002 than between 0.0002 and 0.001. Wait, but in this case, the interval is from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is a span of 0.0009. Hmm, but the number of zeros should be proportional to the length of the interval times the frequency. Let me think differently. The zeros occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, the spacing between consecutive zeros is 1/(n\u03c0) - 1/((n+1)\u03c0) = (1/(n\u03c0)) - (1/((n+1)\u03c0)) = (n+1 - n)/(n(n+1)\u03c0) = 1/(n(n+1)\u03c0). As n increases, this spacing decreases, which makes sense because the zeros get closer together as x approaches zero. But maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since I found that n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, that gives 2865 zeros. But let me check the endpoints. When n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(319*3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(1003.13) \u2248 0.0009968, which is just below 0.001, so that's within the interval. Similarly, when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183*3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000.0001) \u2248 0.0001, which is just above 0.0001, so that's also within the interval. Wait, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but since our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, does that include x = 0.0001 and x = 0.001? No, it's an open interval, so we need x to be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, I need to check whether x = 1/(n\u03c0) is strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. So, for n = 319, x \u2248 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. For n = 3183, x \u2248 0.0001, but since it's an open interval, we need x > 0.0001. So, x = 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than 3183.0988618, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is exactly 0.0001. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which doesn't include 0.0001, we need to exclude n = 3183. Similarly, for the lower end, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, so n must be at least 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 - 1, because n = 3183 gives x = 0.0001, which is excluded. Wait, but earlier I thought n = 3183 gives x \u2248 0.0001, but let me compute it more accurately. Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0): \u03c0 \u2248 3.1415926535, so 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, and 183\u03c0 \u2248 574.79229, so total is approximately 9424.77796 + 574.79229 \u2248 9999.57025. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.57025 \u2248 0.0001000043, which is just slightly above 0.0001. So, 0.0001000043 is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but 0.0001 is 10^{-4}, and 0.0001000043 is 1.000043 \u00d7 10^{-4}, which is indeed greater than 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000043 is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. Therefore, n can be up to 3183. Similarly, for n = 319, x \u2248 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Now, how about n = 318? Let's compute x = 1/(318\u03c0). 318\u03c0 \u2248 318 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 1000.0001. So, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999999, which is just below 0.001, so x \u2248 0.000999999, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Wait, but earlier I thought n starts at 319. Wait, no, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, so n starts at 319. So, n = 318 would give x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999999, which is less than 0.001, but n = 318 is less than 318.30988618, so n = 318 is not included. So, n starts at 319. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, 2865 x-intercepts. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me think again. The function y = sin(1/x) has a zero at every x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, between x = a and x = b, the number of zeros is approximately (b - a) * (1/(\u03c0)) * (1/x^2). Wait, no, that's the derivative, maybe not. Alternatively, the number of zeros can be approximated by integrating the density, but maybe it's easier to count as I did before. Alternatively, the number of zeros between x = a and x = b is the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is between a and b, which is equivalent to n between 1/(b\u03c0) and 1/(a\u03c0). So, in this case, a = 0.0001 and b = 0.001. So, n must satisfy 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0). Let me compute those: 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, and 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be integers greater than 318.30988618 and less than 3183.0988618. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that seems consistent.

Taking reciprocals on both sides (and remembering that flipping the inequality when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive), we get: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Calculating 1/0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0: n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n < approximately 3183.0988618. Since n has to be an integer, n \u2264 3183. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals: 1/0.001 > n\u03c0, which is 1000 > n\u03c0.

Let me check that again. If 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, then n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618. Since n is an integer, n \u2265 319. So, putting it all together, n must satisfy both n \u2265 319 and n \u2264 3183. Wait, that can't be right because 319 is less than 3183, so n must be in the range from 319 to 3183, inclusive. So, the integers n start at 319 and go up to 3183. Now, to find how many integers are in this range, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are inclusive). Wait, no, actually, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n between 319 and 3183, inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Let me just double-check my reasoning to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the function, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). Then, substituting into the interval 0.0001 < x < 0.001, I found that n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct.

So, 10000 > n\u03c0, which means n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.14159265, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 10000 / 3.14159265 \u2248 3183.098.

So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that would suggest there are 2865 x-intercepts. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a lot. Let me verify the steps again. First, x must be between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, x = 1/(n\u03c0) must satisfy 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals, we get 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing all parts by \u03c0, we get 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. So, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183. Now, how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive? The formula is (last - first) + 1. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 gives 2865. Hmm, so that seems correct. But wait, let me think about whether n=3183 is included. Since 3183.098 is the upper limit, n can be up to 3183 because 3183 is less than 3183.098. Similarly, n=319 is greater than 318.309, so that's correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, another thought: the function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is very close to zero, the function oscillates rapidly. Each oscillation corresponds to a peak and a trough, and between each peak and trough, there's an x-intercept. So, each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the sine function completes a half-period, leading to an intercept. So, the number of intercepts should be approximately the number of times 1/x passes through multiples of \u03c0 in that interval. So, the number of intercepts is the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001). Which is exactly what I calculated. So, 2865 seems correct. But wait, another way to think about it: the interval for x is (0.0001, 0.001). Let me compute the corresponding interval for 1/x. Since x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. Now, the sine function is zero at every multiple of \u03c0 in this interval. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which is the same as before. So, n is from ceil(1000/\u03c0) to floor(10000/\u03c0). Calculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so ceil(318.309) is 319. 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so floor(3183.098) is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that confirms it again. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me check if n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0). Let me compute 319\u03c0: 319 * 3.14159265 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 319 * 3 = 957, 319 * 0.1416 \u2248 45.1464, so total \u2248 1002.1464. So, 1/x \u2248 1002.1464, so x \u2248 1/1002.1464 \u2248 0.00099785, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Similarly, n=3183: 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's see, 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.777, 183\u03c0 \u2248 575.01, so total \u2248 9424.777 + 575.01 \u2248 9999.787. So, 1/x \u2248 9999.787, so x \u2248 1/9999.787 \u2248 0.000100002, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. So, both endpoints are included, so n=319 and n=3183 are both valid. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is indeed 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n.

Taking reciprocals again, we get: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001. 1/0.001 is 1000, so n\u03c0 > 1000, which means n > 1000/\u03c0. Now, let's compute these numerical values to find the range of n. First, 10000 divided by \u03c0. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618.

So, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).

But since x = 1/(n\u03c0) must lie strictly between 0.0001 and 0.001, we have to make sure that n is such that 1/(n\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001.

Taking reciprocals on both sides (and remembering that flipping inequalities when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive), we get: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. 1/0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, we get n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 3183.0988618. So, n < approximately 3183.0988618. Since n is an integer, n must be less than or equal to 3183. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001. 1/0.001 is 1000, so n\u03c0 > 1000. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618. Since n is an integer, n must be at least 319. So, putting it all together, n must satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers inclusive, we can subtract the smaller number from the larger and add 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again. Wait, 3183 minus 319 is 2864, yes. Then 2864 + 1 is 2865. Hmm, but I should make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial steps. Let me verify. So, x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, so 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, 1/x is in (1000, 10000). Since 1/x = n\u03c0, then n\u03c0 is in (1000, 10000). So, n must be in (1000/\u03c0, 10000/\u03c0), which is approximately (318.3098, 3183.0988). So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Wait, but 3183 - 319 is 2864, right? Because 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more, so 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then 2864 + 1 is 2865. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to make sure, let me think about it another way. The interval for 1/x is from 1000 to 10000, which is a span of 9000. Since each n\u03c0 is spaced by \u03c0, the number of zeros should be roughly the length of the interval divided by \u03c0. So, 9000 / \u03c0 \u2248 2866.197. Since we're counting integers, it's approximately 2866. But wait, our exact calculation gave us 2865. That's very close. The slight difference is because we're taking the floor and ceiling of the bounds. So, our exact calculation is 2865, which aligns with the approximate value. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we determine where \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\).

    "text": " 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that flipping inequalities when taking reciprocals reverses the inequality signs, I get: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Which is 10000 > n\u03c0. Similarly, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals again, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0, which is 1000 < n\u03c0. So, putting both together, we have 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. To solve for n, I'll divide all parts by \u03c0. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values. First, 1000 divided by \u03c0. Since \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be an integer strictly greater than approximately 318.309886184 and strictly less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183. Now, I need to count how many integers are there from 319 to 3183, inclusive. To find the number of integers between a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the values: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that. 3183 - 319 is equal to 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Each of these integers corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0) within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Sometimes when dealing with inequalities, especially with reciprocals, it's easy to flip the inequality signs incorrectly. Let me double-check. The original interval is 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), substituting gives 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals, as I did, would flip the inequalities, so 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. That seems correct. Then dividing by \u03c0, I get 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183, inclusive. So, the count is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me make sure that 1/(319\u03c0) is indeed greater than 0.0001 and 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.001. Let's compute 1/(319\u03c0). 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 1003.13. So, 1/1003.13 \u2248 0.0009968, which is approximately 0.0009968, which is greater than 0.0001, so that's correct. Now, 1/(3183\u03c0). 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000.06. So, 1/10000.06 \u2248 0.00009999, which is just below 0.001, but wait, 0.00009999 is actually less than 0.0001, which is 0.0001. Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is approximately 0.0001, but actually slightly less. So, 0.00009999 is less than 0.0001, which would mean that 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, which is outside our interval of (0.0001, 0.001). Hmm, that suggests that n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not in the interval. Therefore, the maximum n should be such that 1/(n\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. So, perhaps n should be less than or equal to 3182? Let me check. Let me compute 1/(3182\u03c0). 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000.06 - \u03c0 \u2248 10000.06 - 3.1416 \u2248 9996.918. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.918 \u2248 0.00010003, which is just above 0.0001. So, n=3182 gives x\u22480.00010003, which is in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=3183 gives x\u22480.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. Similarly, let me check the lower end. n=319 gives x\u22480.0009968, which is greater than 0.0001, so that's fine. Now, let me compute the number of integers from n=319 to n=3182 inclusive. So, using the formula, it's 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, that's 2864 integers. Wait, so earlier I had 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865, but since n=3183 is outside the interval, we need to stop at n=3182, which gives 2864. Hmm, so I think I made a mistake earlier by including n=3183. Let me confirm. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is just below 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, n goes up to 3182. Similarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.0009968, which is within the interval, so n starts at 319. Therefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. Wait, but let me make sure. Let me compute 3182 - 319. 3182 - 300 is 2882, minus 19 is 2863. Then, adding 1 gives 2864. So, the total number of x-intercepts is 2864. But wait, let me think again. When n increases, x decreases because x=1/(n\u03c0). So, as n increases from 319 to 3182, x decreases from approximately 0.0009968 to approximately 0.00010003. So, each integer n corresponds to a unique x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is the number of integers n from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought 3183 - 319 +1 was 2865, but since n=3183 is excluded, it's 2864. So, the correct count is 2864. Alternatively, perhaps I can approach this problem by considering the function sin(1/x) and how often it oscillates as x approaches zero. The function sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times as x approaches zero, but in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is very close to zero, the function will oscillate a large number of times, but we're only considering the x-intercepts, which occur at x=1/(n\u03c0). So, each time n increases by 1, x decreases by approximately 1/(n\u03c0) - 1/((n+1)\u03c0) \u2248 1/(n\u00b2\u03c0). But perhaps that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the number of zeros by considering the interval in terms of \u03b8 = 1/x. So, when x is in (0.0001, 0.001), \u03b8 = 1/x is in (1000, 10000). So, \u03b8 ranges from 1000 to 10000 radians. The sine function has zeros at every integer multiple of \u03c0, so the number of zeros between \u03b8=1000 and \u03b8=10000 is equal to the number of integers n such that n\u03c0 is in (1000, 10000). So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Which is the same as before, so n is between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.31 < n < 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, but as we saw earlier, n=3183 gives \u03b8=3183\u03c0\u224810000.06, which is just above 10000, so \u03b8=3183\u03c0 is outside the upper bound of \u03b8=10000. So, the maximum n is 3182, as 3182\u03c0\u22489996.918, which is less than 10000. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but let me think again: when \u03b8 increases from 1000 to 10000, how many times does sin(\u03b8) cross zero? Each zero crossing occurs at \u03b8 = n\u03c0, so the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248318.31 and less than 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, but since \u03b8=3183\u03c0\u224810000.06 is beyond 10000, we have to stop at n=3182, which gives \u03b8=3182\u03c0\u22489996.918, which is within the interval. So, n runs from 319 to 3182 inclusive, giving 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864 zeros. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the number of zeros by considering the interval \u03b8 \u2208 (1000, 10000). The number of zeros is the number of integers n such that n\u03c0 \u2208 (1000, 10000). So, n must satisfy n > 1000/\u03c0 and n < 10000/\u03c0. So, n starts at the smallest integer greater than 1000/\u03c0, which is 319, and ends at the largest integer less than 10000/\u03c0, which is 3183, but wait, 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10000.06, which is beyond 10000, so n must be less than or equal to 3182. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Let me just confirm with another approach. The function sin(1/x) has a zero at x=1/(n\u03c0). The interval for x is (0.0001, 0.001), which is (1/10000, 1/1000). So, 1/(n\u03c0) must be in (1/10000, 1/1000). Therefore, 1/1000 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 1/10000. Taking reciprocals (and flipping inequalities), we get 1000 > n\u03c0 > 10000. Wait, that seems conflicting with earlier. Wait, no: if 1/(n\u03c0) is between 1/10000 and 1/1000, then 1/(1/10000) = 10000 > n\u03c0 > 1000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Which is the same as before. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so n is between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.31 < n < 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182, inclusive, giving 2864 integers. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) has x-intercepts where \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\), which occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for integer \\( n \\).

If I take reciprocals on both sides (remembering that flipping inequalities when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive), it becomes 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Calculating 1/0.0001, that's 10000. So, 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, which is approximately 3.1416, I get n < 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1416 \u2248 3183.098. Since n has to be an integer, n can be at most 3183. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001 = 1000. So, n > 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.309. Since n has to be an integer, n must be at least 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1. Wait, actually, let me check: the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me calculate that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Each of these n corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). Therefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the number of integers. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more to get 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. Yeah, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of it as starting from n=1 up to n=3183, which is 3183 numbers, and then subtracting the numbers from n=1 to n=318, which is 318 numbers. So, 3183 - 318 = 2865. That confirms it. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's the answer. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning.
