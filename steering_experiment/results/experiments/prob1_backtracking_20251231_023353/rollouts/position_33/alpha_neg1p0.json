    "text": " Let's compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. So, 3183 - 319 is indeed 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, but let me think about whether both n=319 and n=3183 are included. Since x must be greater than 0.0001, which corresponds to n=319, and less than 0.001, which corresponds to n=3183, yes, both endpoints are included. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me check if 1/(319\u03c0) is indeed greater than 0.0001. Let me compute 1/(319 * 3.1416). 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 1002. So, 1/1002 \u2248 0.000998, which is less than 0.001, but greater than 0.0001. Similarly, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/10000 \u2248 0.0001. Wait, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, does n=3183 correspond to x=1/(3183\u03c0) which is approximately 0.0001, but x must be greater than 0.0001, so maybe n=3183 is not included. Wait, let's compute 1/(3183 * \u03c0). Let me calculate 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 let's see, 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.777, 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 574.865, so total \u2248 9424.777 + 574.865 \u2248 10,000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10000 = 0.0001, but the interval is x > 0.0001, so x=0.0001 is not included. Therefore, n=3183 would give x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but since the interval is open, x=0.0001 is excluded. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.098, so the largest integer n is 3183, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the largest n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3182. Let me check: 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000 - \u03c0) \u2248 approximately 0.0001, but slightly more. Let me compute 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's compute 3000*3.1416=9424.8, 182*3.1416\u2248571.83, so total\u22489424.8+571.83\u22489996.63. So, 1/9996.63\u22480.000100033, which is just over 0.0001. So, x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.000100033>0.0001, so it's included. Similarly, n=3183 gives x\u22480.000099967<0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the upper limit for n is 3182. Similarly, for the lower limit, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Now, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 is 3182 - 319 +1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 +1=2864. So, there are 2864 x-intercepts. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but after correcting for n=3183 being excluded, it's 2864. Let me confirm this calculation again. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3182. The number of terms in this sequence is 3182 - 319 +1. Let me compute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300=2882, 2882 -19=2863. Then, 2863 +1=2864. Yes, that's correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but let me think again: for each n from 319 to 3182 inclusive, there's exactly one x-intercept at x=1/(n\u03c0). Therefore, the total number is 3182 - 319 +1=2864. Alternatively, the number of integers between a and b inclusive is b - a +1. So, 3182 - 319 +1=2864. So, the final answer should be 2864. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial calculation of n's range. Let me re-express the inequalities:\n\nGiven 0.0001 < x < 0.001,\n\nand x=1/(n\u03c0),\n\nso 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nTaking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities because reciprocating positive numbers reverses the inequality):\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing all parts by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nCalculating:\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098861\n\n10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098862\n\nSo, n must be an integer strictly greater than 318.3098861 and strictly less than 3183.098862.\n\nTherefore, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest integer n is 3183, but wait, 3183 is less than 3183.098862, so 3183 is included because 3183 < 3183.098862.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is the lower bound, but the interval is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001. So, if 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, then x=1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is not included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 is excluded, so the maximum n is 3182.\n\nWait, but according to the inequality, n must be less than 3183.098862, so n=3183 is allowed because 3183 < 3183.098862. But in reality, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is the lower bound, but since the interval is open, x=0.0001 is not included. Therefore, n=3183 corresponds to x=0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nSimilarly, for the lower bound, n must be greater than 318.3098861, so the smallest n is 319.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 +1.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3182 - 319 = 2863\n\n2863 +1 = 2864\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 3183 was excluded, so the upper limit is 3182, which gives 2864 intercepts.\n\nBut let me check with specific values:\n\nFor n=319:\n\nx=1/(319\u03c0)\u22481/(1002.0)\u22480.000998, which is less than 0.001 and greater than 0.0001, so included.\n\nFor n=3182:\n\nx=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22481/(10000 - \u03c0)\u22481/9996.63\u22480.000100033, which is just over 0.0001, so included.\n\nFor n=3183:\n\nx=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22481/10000\u22480.0001, which is the lower bound, but not included, so excluded.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3182 - 319 +1=2864.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is there a possibility that between 0.0001 and 0.001, the function sin(1/x) oscillates so rapidly that it crosses the x-axis multiple times between each integer n? No, because each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept at x=1/(n\u03c0). So, each integer n in that range gives exactly one x-intercept. Therefore, the total number is indeed 2864.\n\nBut wait, let me think about the interval (0.0001, 0.001). The function sin(1/x) has a lot of oscillations as x approaches 0, but in the interval from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is from x=1e-4 to x=1e-3, the function is oscillating between -1 and 1, crossing the x-axis each time 1/x increases by \u03c0. So, each time x decreases by a factor that corresponds to an increase of \u03c0 in 1/x.\n\nTherefore, the number of zeros is the number of times 1/x crosses multiples of \u03c0 in the interval (1000, 10000). Because x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, so 1/x is between 1000 and 10000.\n\nSo, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000, and we need to find how many integer multiples of \u03c0 lie within this interval.\n\nSo, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nWhich is equivalent to 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.3098861 < n < 3183.098862.\n\nSo, n can be 319, 320, ..., 3183.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n=3183 is excluded because x=1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001 is excluded, but according to the inequality, n can be up to 3183.098862, so n=3183 is allowed because 3183 < 3183.098862.\n\nBut wait, let's compute 1/(3183\u03c0). Let's compute 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 let's compute 3000\u03c0\u22489424.77796, 183\u03c0\u2248574.86543, so total\u22489424.77796 + 574.86543\u224810000. So, 3183\u03c0\u224810000, so 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001. Therefore, x=0.0001, which is excluded because the interval is (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is not included, so n must be less than 3183.098862, so n=3183 is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nNumber of terms: 3182 - 319 +1=2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with an example. Let's take n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.000998, which is within (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.000100033, which is just above 0.0001, so included. n=3183: x\u22480.0001, excluded.\n\nTherefore, the total number is 3182 - 319 +1=2864.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe number of x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is determined by finding the integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies within this interval. This results in n ranging from 319 to 3182, yielding 2864 intercepts.\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{2864}."

So, that suggests there are 2865 x-intercepts. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial setup. Let me go back to the inequalities: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, flipping the inequalities when taking reciprocals (since all terms are positive), we get 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.

So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct. But wait, another way to think about it: the function sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. The number of oscillations between x = a and x = b is roughly proportional to 1/a - 1/b, because as x decreases, 1/x increases, so the function completes more periods. So, the number of zeros would be approximately (1/a - 1/b) / \u03c0, since each period has two zeros, but since we're counting each zero, it's actually the number of half-periods. Wait, no, each period of sin(\u03b8) has two zeros (at \u03b8 and \u03b8 + \u03c0), but for each zero crossing, it's every \u03c0 units in \u03b8. So, the number of zeros between \u03b8 = c and \u03b8 = d is roughly (d - c)/\u03c0. In this case, \u03b8 = 1/x, so when x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, \u03b8 is between 1000 and 10000. So, the number of zeros is (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 \u2248 9000/3.1416 \u2248 2866. But wait, that's slightly different from my previous calculation. Hmm, but wait, the exact number is 2865. So, that's consistent. The approximate method gives around 2866, and the exact calculation gives 2865. The difference is likely due to the endpoints. So, I think 2865 is the correct exact number.

    "text": " Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. Hmm, 3183 minus 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But wait a second, let me think if I did everything correctly. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches zero. So, in the interval from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is quite close to zero, the function oscillates rapidly. Each oscillation corresponds to a cycle of sine, which has one zero crossing in each half-period. Wait, actually, in each full period of sine, there are two zero crossings. But since we're dealing with 1/x inside the sine, each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the sine function completes a half-period, resulting in a zero crossing. So, the number of zero crossings between x = a and x = b is roughly proportional to the difference in 1/(\u03c0x) evaluated at a and b. So, the number of zeros N is approximately (1/(\u03c0a) - 1/(\u03c0b)). Let me compute that: N \u2248 (1/(\u03c0*0.0001) - 1/(\u03c0*0.001)) = (10000/\u03c0 - 1000/\u03c0) = (9000)/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.198. Hmm, so approximately 2866 zeros. But earlier, I calculated 2865. That's very close. So, considering that the exact count is 2865, which is just one less than the approximate value. That makes sense because when you count from n = 319 to n = 3183, inclusive, you get exactly 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I think my initial calculation is correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial substitution. So, when I set 1/x = n\u03c0, then x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, for x in (0.0001, 0.001), 1/(n\u03c0) must be in that interval. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities because reciprocating positive numbers reverses the inequality), we get 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Then, dividing by \u03c0, we have 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. As I computed earlier, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct.\n\nJust to confirm, let's take a smaller example to see if the method works. Suppose I wanted to find the number of zeros between x = 0.1 and x = 0.2. Then, 0.1 < x < 0.2, so 1/x is between 5 and 10. So, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, 0.1 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.2. Taking reciprocals, 5 < n\u03c0 < 10, so 5/\u03c0 \u2248 1.591 < n < 10/\u03c0 \u2248 3.183. So, n can be 2 or 3. Therefore, two x-intercepts. Let me check: n=2, x=1/(2\u03c0) \u2248 0.159, which is between 0.1 and 0.2. n=3, x=1/(3\u03c0) \u2248 0.106, which is also between 0.1 and 0.2. So, two intercepts. That's correct. So, the method works here. So, applying the same logic to the original problem, 2865 intercepts. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, leading to x = 1/(n\u03c0). For x in (0.0001, 0.001), n ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, the inequalities: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, solving for n: 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0).

The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think about how many times sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. Since 1/x becomes very large as x approaches 0, the function sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a finite interval, the number of oscillations is finite. Each oscillation corresponds to a peak and a trough, and between each peak and trough, there's an x-intercept. So, the number of x-intercepts is equal to the number of times the function crosses the x-axis, which is essentially the number of zeros in that interval. Since each zero corresponds to a specific n, the count we did earlier should be correct.

Starting from the inequalities: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n: 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0).

So, n must be an integer strictly greater than 318.309 and strictly less than 3183.098. So, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest is 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, that seems correct. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But wait, let me think again. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is very close to zero, the function will oscillate rapidly. Each oscillation corresponds to a period of 2\u03c0 in terms of \u03b8 = 1/x. So, the number of zeros should correspond to how many times \u03b8 passes through multiples of \u03c0 in that interval. Alternatively, the number of zeros can be approximated by the difference in \u03b8 values divided by \u03c0. Let's see, \u03b8 = 1/x, so when x is 0.001, \u03b8 = 1000, and when x is 0.0001, \u03b8 = 10000. So, \u03b8 ranges from 1000 to 10000. The number of zeros of sin(\u03b8) in the interval (1000, 10000) is approximately (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0, since each zero occurs every \u03c0 units. So, that would be 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.198. Hmm, that's very close to our earlier result of 2865. The slight difference is probably because we're taking the integer parts. So, this method gives us about 2866, but our exact calculation gave 2865. The difference is likely due to whether we include the endpoints or not. Since x is in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001), \u03b8 is in (1000, 10000), which doesn't include the endpoints. So, when \u03b8 approaches 1000 from above, x approaches 0.001 from below, and similarly for \u03b8 approaching 10000 from below. So, the zeros occur at \u03b8 = n\u03c0, where n is integer, and \u03b8 must be strictly greater than 1000 and strictly less than 10000. So, n\u03c0 must be in (1000, 10000). Therefore, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, as before. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me think again. The function sin(1/x) crosses zero at each x = 1/(n\u03c0), but does it cross zero only once at each x, or could there be multiple crossings? Since sin(1/x) oscillates between -1 and 1, each zero crossing is a single point where it crosses from positive to negative or vice versa. So, each n corresponds to exactly one zero crossing. Therefore, the number of zeros is exactly equal to the number of integers n in that range, which is 2865. So, I think that's the correct answer. Just to make sure, let me consider a smaller interval and see if the method works. Suppose I take the interval (0.1, 0.2). Then, \u03b8 = 1/x would range from 5 to 10. The number of zeros should be the number of n where 5 < n\u03c0 < 10. So, n > 5/\u03c0 \u2248 1.591, so n starts at 2, and n < 10/\u03c0 \u2248 3.183, so n goes up to 3. So, n = 2,3. That's 2 zeros. Let's check: x = 1/(2\u03c0) \u2248 0.159 and x = 1/(3\u03c0) \u2248 0.106. Wait, but 0.106 is less than 0.1, so it's outside the interval. Hmm, so maybe my method isn't perfect. Wait, in this case, n=2 gives x\u22480.159, which is in (0.1, 0.2), but n=3 gives x\u22480.106, which is less than 0.1, so it's not included. So, actually, only n=2 is valid, giving one zero in (0.1, 0.2). But according to my earlier method, n would be from 2 to 3, but x=1/(3\u03c0) is less than 0.1, so it's not included. So, perhaps I need to adjust the upper and lower bounds to ensure that x is strictly within the interval. So, in the original problem, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001, so 1/x must be less than 10000 and greater than 1000. So, \u03b8 must be in (1000, 10000). Therefore, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 and less than 10000/\u03c0. Since n must be an integer, n starts at floor(1000/\u03c0) + 1 and ends at floor(10000/\u03c0). Let's compute floor(1000/\u03c0): 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so floor is 318, so n starts at 319. Similarly, floor(10000/\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so floor is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that seems correct. In the smaller interval example, (0.1, 0.2), \u03b8 ranges from 5 to 10. So, n must satisfy 5 < n\u03c0 < 10, so n > 5/\u03c0 \u2248 1.591 and n < 10/\u03c0 \u2248 3.183. So, n can be 2 and 3. But x = 1/(2\u03c0) \u2248 0.159 (which is in (0.1, 0.2)) and x = 1/(3\u03c0) \u2248 0.106 (which is less than 0.1, so not in the interval). So, only n=2 gives a valid x in the interval. Therefore, the number of zeros is 1, but according to our method, n=2 and 3, which would suggest 2 zeros, but in reality, only 1 is in the interval. So, perhaps our method overcounts by 1 in that case. So, maybe in the original problem, we need to check whether x=1/(n\u03c0) is strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. So, perhaps we need to compute the smallest n such that 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which is n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n=319. Similarly, the largest n such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which is n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n=3183. So, n=319 to 3183, inclusive, giving 2865. But in the smaller interval, n=2 and n=3, but x=1/(3\u03c0) is less than 0.1, so it's excluded. So, perhaps in the original problem, all x=1/(n\u03c0) for n=319 to 3183 are within (0.0001, 0.001). Let's check for n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.46) \u2248 0.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. For n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, x=0.0001 is not included. Wait, but n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001, which is the lower bound, but the interval is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001. So, perhaps n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001, which is excluded. So, perhaps n should go up to 3182. Let me check: 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000 - \u03c0) \u2248 approximately 0.0001, but let me compute it more accurately. Let's compute 3182\u03c0: \u03c0\u22483.14159265, so 3182*3.14159265 \u2248 3182*3.1416 \u2248 Let's compute 3000*3.1416=9424.8, 182*3.1416\u2248182*3=546, 182*0.1416\u224825.84, so total\u2248546+25.84\u2248571.84. So, total\u22489424.8+571.84\u22489996.64. So, 3182\u03c0\u22489996.64, so 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22481/9996.64\u22480.000100034, which is just above 0.0001. So, x\u22480.000100034, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n=3182 gives x\u22480.000100034, which is included. Similarly, n=3183: 3183\u03c0\u22483183*3.14159265\u22483183*3.1416\u2248 Let's compute 3000*3.1416=9424.8, 183*3.1416\u2248183*3=549, 183*0.1416\u224825.96, so total\u2248549+25.96\u2248574.96. So, total\u22489424.8+574.96\u22489999.76. So, 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22481/9999.76\u22480.0001000024, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. Wait, but 0.0001 is 10^{-4}, which is 0.0001. So, 0.0001000024 is just a tiny bit above 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 is included. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n gives 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183, yielding 2865 integer values.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

    "text": " Let me calculate that: 3183 - 319 = 2864; 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my steps. First, I found that x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0). Then, I set up the inequalities 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n, I got n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883; 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check if 1/(319\u03c0) is indeed greater than 0.0001. Let's compute 1/(319\u03c0): 1/(319 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(1002.1964) \u2248 0.000998, which is approximately 0.001, but wait, 0.000998 is less than 0.001, so that's within the interval. Wait, no, 0.000998 is approximately 0.001, but 0.000998 is less than 0.001, so 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000998 is within (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001. But wait, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000, 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001. So, actually, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since we're dealing with the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. Therefore, x = 1/(n\u03c0) must satisfy 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but since 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but the interval is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001, meaning n must be less than 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but we need to check if 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Wait, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but exactly, 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248

    "text": " Let me calculate that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n between 319 and 3183, inclusive. Therefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 1/(0.0001\u03c0) is indeed 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, and 1/(0.001\u03c0) is 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 minus 300 is 2883, minus 19 is 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct.

    "text": " Let me calculate that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183, inclusive. Each of these n corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recalculate the bounds for n. Starting with 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, taking reciprocals (and remembering to reverse the inequalities because reciprocals of positive numbers reverse the inequality), we get: 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Then, dividing each part by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating these, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098. Since n is an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. Yes, that seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's the right answer. But just to be thorough, let me consider the behavior of the function near the interval. As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. However, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a finite interval, the function will oscillate, but the number of oscillations is finite. Each oscillation crosses the x-axis twice, but wait, no, actually, each time sin(1/x) goes from 0 up to 1 and back down to 0, that's half a period, and then it goes negative. So, each full period would have two x-intercepts. Wait, but in our earlier approach, we found x-intercepts at x = 1/(n\u03c0), which are spaced such that each n gives one x-intercept. So, does that mean each x-intercept corresponds to a zero crossing? Let me think. The function sin(\u03b8) crosses zero at \u03b8 = n\u03c0 for each integer n, so each time \u03b8 increases by \u03c0, there's a zero crossing. So, for \u03b8 = 1/x, each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, x decreases by a factor that corresponds to 1/(n\u03c0). So, each x-intercept is at x = 1/(n\u03c0), and between each consecutive pair of these x-intercepts, the function completes a half-period, going from 0 up to 1 and back down to 0, or from 0 down to -1 and back up to 0. Therefore, each x-intercept is a single point where the function crosses zero, either from positive to negative or negative to positive. So, each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept. Therefore, the total number of x-intercepts is indeed the number of integers n between 319 and 3183, inclusive, which is 2865. I think that's solid. So, I'm confident the answer is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, leading to x = 1/(n\u03c0).

Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, let me double-check that calculation. So, 3183 - 319 is indeed 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Yeah, that seems correct. I should also make sure that the endpoints are correctly handled. Since x is strictly greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001, I need to ensure that x = 1/(n\u03c0) is within that open interval. So, when n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.03) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001 and greater than 0.0001. Similarly, when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.098) \u2248 0.0000997, which is just below 0.0001. Wait, hold on, that's a problem. Because 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0000997, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n = 3183 gives x \u2248 0.0000997, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the upper bound should be n = 3182, since 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.098 - \u03c0) \u2248 1/(9999.75) \u2248 0.0001000025, which is just above 0.0001. So, actually, the upper limit for n should be 3182, not 3183. Let me recalculate the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, 3182 - 319 + 1 = 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, there are 2864 x-intercepts. Wait, so I made a mistake earlier by including n = 3183, which actually gives x just below 0.0001, so it's not in the interval. Therefore, the correct upper bound is n = 3182. So, the number of integers is from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. Let me confirm this with exact calculations. Let's compute 1/(n\u03c0) for n = 319 and n = 3182. For n = 319: 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.03) \u2248 0.000997, which is within (0.0001, 0.001). For n = 3182: 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.098) \u2248 0.0000997, which is just below 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the maximum n that gives x > 0.0001 is n = floor(1/(0.0001\u03c0)) = floor(10000/\u03c0) \u2248 floor(3183.098) = 3183, but wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000997 < 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n = floor(1/(0.0001\u03c0)) - 1 = 3183 - 1 = 3182. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. Alternatively, another way to compute the number of integers between a and b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. So, the correct number of x-intercepts is 2864. I think that's the right answer. To recap: x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer n. We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n, we get 1000 < n < 10000. But since x must be greater than 0.0001, n must be less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n \u2264 3183, but n=3183 gives x \u2248 0.0000997 < 0.0001, so n must be \u2264 3182. Similarly, n must be \u2265 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n \u2265 319. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182, giving 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864 x-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n.

Similarly, n > 318.309, so n \u2265 319. Thus, n ranges from 319 to 3182, giving 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864 x-intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2864}$"

So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, but let me think again. The function sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches zero, and the number of oscillations increases as x gets smaller. So, in the interval from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is from 10^-4 to 10^-3, the function should oscillate quite a lot. Each oscillation between two consecutive zeros corresponds to a half-period.

But in our case, x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a finite interval. So, the number of zeros should be finite, and according to my calculation, it's 2865. Hmm, but let me check with specific examples. Let me take n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.06) \u2248 0.000997, which is just below 0.001, so it's within the interval.

Wait, so x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since it's equal to 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but the interval is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but since the interval is open, we need x > 0.0001. Therefore, x = 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n can be up to 3183, but when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is exactly the lower bound.

Wait, no, because n has to satisfy x = 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, so n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n can be up to 3183, but when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is not included. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. Let me check: 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000 - \u03c0) \u2248 approximately 0.00010003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. So, n can be from 319 to 3182, inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, where did I go wrong? Let me recast the inequalities properly. The interval is 0.0001 < x < 0.001. So, substituting x = 1/(n\u03c0), we have:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing all parts by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nCalculating:\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098861\n\n10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098862\n\nSo, n must satisfy:\n\n318.3098861 < n < 3183.098862\n\nSince n must be an integer, the smallest integer greater than 318.3098861 is 319, and the largest integer less than 3183.098862 is 3183.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is the lower bound, but the interval is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.098862, so n can be up to 3183, but x=1/(3183\u03c0)= approximately 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3183 - 1 = 3182? Wait, no, because n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is excluded, so the maximum n is 3182.\n\nWait, but if n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is exactly the lower bound. Since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so n must be less than 3183.098862, so n can be up to 3183, but n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so n can only go up to 3182.\n\nWait, but let me check: 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) = 0.0001, which is exactly the lower bound. Since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), x must be greater than 0.0001, so n must satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which implies n < 10000/\u03c0 \u22483183.098862. Therefore, the maximum integer n is 3183, but when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 +1.\n\nCalculating that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 +1=2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, which one is correct?\n\nLet me check with specific numbers.\n\nIf n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.000997, which is less than 0.001 and greater than 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nIf n=3182, x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22481/(10000 - \u03c0)\u22480.00010003, which is greater than 0.0001, so included.\n\nIf n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)=\u22480.0001, which is excluded.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of terms is 3182 - 319 +1.\n\n3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, which is correct?\n\nLet me recount.\n\nFrom n=319 to n=3183, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1=2865.\n\nBut since n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, we have to subtract 1, so 2865 -1=2864.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the correct number is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a +1.\n\nBut in this case, since n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, we need to go up to n=3182, which gives x\u22480.00010003, which is included.\n\nSo, the number of integers is from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nSo, 3182 - 319 +1=2864.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to n between approximately 319 and 3182. The number of integers in this range is 2864.\n\n$\\boxed{2864}$"

I found that n must be greater than approximately 318.309 and less than approximately 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of terms in the sequence from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, that's correct. So, there are 2865 integer values of n, which correspond to 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me think again. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is an open interval, meaning it doesn't include the endpoints. So, do I need to check if x = 1/(n\u03c0) is actually within (0.0001, 0.001) for n from 319 to 3183? Let me confirm with n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.13) \u2248 0.0009968, which is approximately 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001 and greater than 0.0001. Similarly, for n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.00) \u2248 0.0001, but since it's an open interval, we need to check if x is strictly greater than 0.0001. Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0): 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000.00, so x \u2248 0.0001, but since it's 1/(3183\u03c0), which is slightly less than 0.0001 because 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000. Wait, no, 3183 * \u03c0 is exactly 10000, but since \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, 3183 * \u03c0 is actually 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let me compute that. 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.1416 \u2248 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, 3183 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0928. So total \u2248 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.0928 \u2248 450.7128. So total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9549 + 450.7128 \u2248 9999.7128. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.7128 \u2248 0.00010000284. Wait, that's approximately 0.00010000284, which is just over 0.0001. But our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010000284 is just barely above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. Similarly, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, both n = 319 and n = 3183 give x-values within the interval. Therefore, the total number of x-intercepts is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 is 2865. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). That seems like a lot, but considering how rapidly sin(1/x) oscillates near zero, it makes sense that there are so many intercepts in such a small interval.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n.

So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n, I get 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0), which is 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.309 < n < 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then +1 is 2865. So, there are 2865 x-intercepts in that interval. Wait, that seems correct, but let me think about it another way. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches zero. The number of oscillations increases as x gets smaller. In the interval from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is from 10^-4 to 10^-3, the function will oscillate more as x decreases. Each oscillation of the sine function crosses zero twice, once going up and once going down. But wait, no, in the function sin(1/x), each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the function completes a half-period, so each full period would require 1/x to increase by 2\u03c0. Therefore, the number of zeros in the interval would be roughly the number of times 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0 as x moves from 0.001 to 0.0001. So, the change in 1/x is from 1000 to 10000. So, the number of zeros would be the number of multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. The number of zeros would be approximately (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0, which is 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866. But wait, earlier I got 2865. That's close but not exactly the same. Hmm, maybe because I'm counting the number of integers between 319 and 3183, which is 2865, but the approximate method gives 2866. That's probably because the endpoints are not exact multiples of \u03c0. Let me see: when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.33) \u2248 0.000996, which is just above 0.0001, so that's correct. When n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, but wait, 3183\u03c0 is approximately 3183*3.1416 \u2248 10000. So, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001. Therefore, n must be less than 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001, which is not included in the interval. So, n should go up to 3182. Let me recalculate that. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is the lower bound, but the interval is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, which is not included. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. Wait, let me check: if n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is not greater than 0.0001, so n must be less than or equal to 3182. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182. Therefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 +1 = 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. Hmm, so that's different from my earlier calculation. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify: the inequality is 0.0001 < x < 0.001, and x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let's solve for n in terms of x.\n\nFirst, for the lower bound: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Rearranged, n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but we need to check if x=1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Let's compute 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183*3.1416) \u2248 1/10000 \u2248 0.0001. So, x=0.0001 is the lower bound, but the interval is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.098, but n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is not included. So, the maximum n is 3182. Similarly, for the upper bound: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, so the minimum integer n is 319. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Now, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 is 3182 - 319 +1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but now it's 2864. I think the confusion comes from whether n=3183 is included or not. Since x=1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is not in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001), so n=3183 is excluded. Therefore, the correct count is from n=319 to n=3182, which is 2864 x-intercepts. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the number of zeros is equal to the number of times 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0 as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001. So, the number of zeros is approximately the difference between 1/(0.001\u03c0) and 1/(0.0001\u03c0), which is 1000/\u03c0 - 10000/\u03c0 = -9000/\u03c0. But since we're looking for positive n, it's the number of integers between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866. However, since the interval is open, we have to subtract 1 or 2 depending on whether the endpoints are included. Since n must be strictly less than 10000/\u03c0 and strictly greater than 1000/\u03c0, the number of integers is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0). Let's compute that:\n\nceil(1000/\u03c0) = ceil(318.309) = 319\n\nfloor(10000/\u03c0) = floor(3183.098) = 3183\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Wait, but earlier I concluded that n=3183 is excluded because x=0.0001 is not included. So, perhaps this method counts n=3183 as included, but since x=0.0001 is not in the interval, we have to subtract 1. So, 2865 -1 = 2864. Therefore, the correct number is 2864. To confirm, let's consider that each x-intercept corresponds to a unique integer n, and the number of n's is the number of integers between 319 and 3182 inclusive. So, 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0. This occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. We need to find n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving these inequalities gives n ranging from 319 to 3182. The number of integers in this range is 2864.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}."

Let me recast the inequalities:\n\nGiven 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nTaking reciprocals (and remembering that inequalities reverse when taking reciprocals for positive numbers):\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nThen, dividing by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nWhich is approximately:\n\n318.309 < n < 3183.098\n\nSo, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check with specific examples. For n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.03) \u2248 0.000998, which is just below 0.001, so it's included. For n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), we exclude the endpoints. So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. Therefore, n must satisfy:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but let's check x=1/(3183\u03c0). 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since it's exactly 0.0001 when n=3183, but our interval is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001, so n must be less than 3183.098, meaning the maximum n is 3183, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded, so the maximum n is 3182? Wait, that's conflicting. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, if n=3183, then x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound of the interval, but the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded. So, the maximum n is 3182, because for n=3182, x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182*3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000 - something) \u2248 0.0001000... but slightly more than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. Wait, but 3182\u03c0 \u2248 3182*3.1416 \u2248 10000 - let's compute 3182*3.1416:\n\n3182 * 3 = 9546\n\n3182 * 0.1416 \u2248 3182 * 0.1 = 318.2; 3182 * 0.04 = 127.28; 3182 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0912. So total \u2248 318.2 + 127.28 + 5.0912 \u2248 450.5712. So total 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9546 + 450.5712 \u2248 9996.5712. So 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.5712 \u2248 0.000100034, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n can be up to 3183, but wait, for n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, which is excluded. So, the maximum n is 3182. Similarly, the lower bound: n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Now, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, which is correct? Let me check with n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.03) \u2248 0.000998, which is less than 0.001, so included. For n=3182, x\u22480.000100034, which is just above 0.0001, so included. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought 3183 - 319 +1=2865, but since n goes up to 3182, it's 2864. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier by including n=3183, which gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. So, the correct count is from 319 to 3182, which is 2864 integers. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. But wait, let me double-check the calculation: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 is 2864. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, think of it as (3182 - 318) = 2864, since 318 is the number before 319. Wait, no, that's not quite accurate. The formula is upper - lower +1. So, 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Therefore, the answer is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3182. The number of integers in this range is 2864.\n\n$\\boxed{2864}$"

The sine function is zero when its argument is an integer multiple of \\( \\pi \\), i.e., \\( \\sin \\theta = 0 \\) when \\( \\theta = n\\pi \\) for some integer \\( n \\).
