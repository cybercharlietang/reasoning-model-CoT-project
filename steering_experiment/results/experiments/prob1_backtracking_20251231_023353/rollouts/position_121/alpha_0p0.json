    "text": " So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that's correct. Therefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, let me think about the behavior of sin(1/x). As x approaches 0 from the positive side, 1/x approaches infinity, and sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is very close to zero, the function oscillates a lot. Each oscillation between 0 and \u03c0 corresponds to a half-period, but each full period is 2\u03c0. So, each time 1/x increases by 2\u03c0, the function completes a full cycle, which includes one positive peak, one negative peak, and crossing zero twice. Wait, but actually, each full period of sine function is 2\u03c0, so each period corresponds to an increase of 2\u03c0 in \u03b8, where \u03b8 = 1/x. So, the number of zeros in a given interval would correspond to the number of times \u03b8 crosses multiples of \u03c0. So, the number of zeros in x between a and b is equal to the number of integers n such that 1/b < n\u03c0 < 1/a. Wait, that's similar to what I did earlier, but let me see.\n\nWait, so if I have x between a and b, then 1/x is between 1/b and 1/a. So, \u03b8 = 1/x is between 1/b and 1/a. So, the number of zeros of sin(\u03b8) in \u03b8 between 1/b and 1/a is equal to the number of times \u03b8 crosses n\u03c0 for integer n in that interval. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1/b < n\u03c0 < 1/a. So, solving for n: n > 1/(b\u03c0) and n < 1/(a\u03c0). So, n must be integers between 1/(b\u03c0) and 1/(a\u03c0). Wait, but in our problem, a is 0.0001 and b is 0.001, so a = 0.0001, b = 0.001. So, 1/b = 1000, 1/a = 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must be between 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, which is the same as before. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, that's consistent with what I found earlier. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about the function's behavior again. Between x=0.0001 and x=0.001, 1/x goes from 10000 down to 1000. So, \u03b8 goes from 10000 to 1000. So, as \u03b8 decreases from 10000 to 1000, sin(\u03b8) oscillates between -1 and 1, crossing zero each time \u03b8 crosses a multiple of \u03c0. So, the number of zero crossings is the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. So, the smallest multiple of \u03c0 greater than 1000 is 319\u03c0, since 318\u03c0 \u2248 1000. So, n starts at 319, and the largest multiple of \u03c0 less than 10000 is 3183\u03c0, since 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.689. So, n goes up to 3183. Therefore, the number of zero crossings is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, that's consistent. So, I think I can confidently say that the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nBut wait, let me just check if there's any possibility that I'm missing something. For example, could there be an overlap where two zeros coincide? Or perhaps a case where n is such that 1/(n\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001 or 0.001? But since 0.0001 is 1/10000 and 0.001 is 1/1000, and \u03c0 is irrational, so 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0 are not integers, meaning that there's no integer n where 1/(n\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. So, all the zeros are strictly inside the interval (0.0001, 0.001), so they are all counted. Therefore, 2865 is the correct number of x-intercepts.\n\nSo, to recap, the steps are:\n\n1. Recognize that sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0).\n\n2. Determine the range of x: 0.0001 < x < 0.001.\n\n3. Substitute x = 1/(n\u03c0) into the inequalities to find the range of n: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\n4. Solve for n: n must be between 318.309 and 3183.098, so n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\n5. Calculate the number of integers in this range: 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\n6. Confirm that each n corresponds to a unique x in the interval, and that the endpoints are not included, but the calculated x values are within the open interval.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nBut wait, let me think again: when n increases by 1, x decreases by a certain amount. Each time n increases by 1, we get another x-intercept. So, the function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly as x approaches 0, which in this case, our interval is from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is pretty close to zero, so the function oscillates a lot. Each oscillation crosses zero twice, but wait, no: sin(\u03b8) crosses zero once every \u03c0 interval, so each time \u03b8 increases by \u03c0, sin(\u03b8) crosses zero once. So, in terms of x, since \u03b8 = 1/x, each increase of \u03b8 by \u03c0 corresponds to a decrease in x by \u0394x such that \u0394\u03b8 = \u03c0, so \u0394x = -\u0394\u03b8/(\u03b8^2) approximately, but maybe that's overcomplicating. But in any case, each zero crossing corresponds to an increase in n by 1, so each n gives one x-intercept.

Therefore, the final answer is 2865.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me think about this again. The function sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches zero. As x approaches zero from the positive side, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates increasingly rapidly between -1 and 1. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a very small interval near zero, the function will cross the x-axis many times. Each time 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0, sin(1/x) will be zero, so each zero crossing corresponds to x = 1/(n\u03c0), where n is an integer. Now, to find how many such x lie in (0.0001, 0.001), we set up the inequalities 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which gives us n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098 and n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. Therefore, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183. The count is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me just confirm with another approach. The number of zeros of sin(1/x) in (a, b) is equal to the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (a, b). So, we can write this as the number of integers n satisfying a < 1/(n\u03c0) < b, which is equivalent to 1/(b\u03c0) < n < 1/(a\u03c0). So, in our case, a = 0.0001, b = 0.001. Therefore, n must satisfy 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0), which is approximately 318.309 < n < 3183.098. The number of integers in this interval is floor(3183.098) - ceil(318.309) +1. Which is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.

Therefore, I can conclude that the number of x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2865.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about the behavior of the function. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches zero. So, in the interval from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is very close to zero, the function oscillates rapidly. Each oscillation crosses the x-axis twice: once going up and once going down. But wait, no, actually, each full period of sine function crosses zero twice. But wait, in this case, the function is sin(1/x), so as x decreases, the argument 1/x increases, leading to more oscillations. So, each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the sine function completes a half-period, meaning it crosses zero once. Wait, no, actually, each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the sine function goes from 0 up to 1, back to 0, down to -1, and back to 0. So, each full period is 2\u03c0 in terms of the argument, which would correspond to x changing by 1/(n\u03c0) to 1/((n+1)\u03c0), which is a decrease in x by 1/(n\u03c0) - 1/((n+1)\u03c0) = \u03c0/(n(n+1)).\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The key point is that each zero crossing occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0), and we've correctly identified the range of n that places x within (0.0001, 0.001). So, each n from 319 to 3183 gives a unique x in that interval, and each such x is a zero of the function. Therefore, the total number of zeros is indeed 2865.\n\nI think that's solid.

Let me go through the steps again to be absolutely sure.\n\nFirst, the function is y = sin(1/x). The x-intercepts occur where sin(1/x) = 0, which happens when 1/x = n\u03c0, where n is an integer. So, x = 1/(n\u03c0).\n\nWe need to find all x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, 0.0001 < x < 0.001.\n\nSubstituting x = 1/(n\u03c0), we get:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nLet's solve for n.\n\nStarting with the left inequality:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0)\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0 (positive, so inequality remains the same):\n\n0.0001 * n\u03c0 < 1\n\nDivide both sides by 0.0001:\n\nn\u03c0 < 10000\n\nSo, n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618\n\nSimilarly, the right inequality:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0:\n\n1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by 0.001:\n\nn\u03c0 > 1000\n\nSo, n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618\n\nTherefore, n must satisfy:\n\n318.30988618 < n < 3183.0988618\n\nSince n must be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319, and the largest possible n is 3183.\n\nNow, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, we use the formula:\n\nNumber of integers = (Last - First) + 1\n\nSo, (3183 - 319) + 1 = 2864 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, so that seems consistent. But let me just check with a small example. Suppose I have n from 2 to 5. The numbers are 2,3,4,5, which is 4 numbers. Using the formula: (5 - 2) +1 = 4. Correct. Similarly, from 1 to 3: 3 numbers, formula gives (3 -1) +1 =3. Correct. So, yes, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something else. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. But in our case, x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is quite close to zero. So, the function is oscillating rapidly. Each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the sine function completes a cycle, hence crossing zero. So, each increment of n by 1 corresponds to another zero crossing. So, the number of zero crossings should be approximately the number of times 1/x crosses multiples of \u03c0 in that interval.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should think about the change in 1/x over the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Let me compute 1/x at the endpoints:\n\nAt x = 0.0001, 1/x = 10000\n\nAt x = 0.001, 1/x = 1000\n\nSo, as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000.\n\nSo, the function 1/x is moving from 10000 to 1000, which is a decrease of 9000.\n\nNow, each time 1/x decreases by \u03c0, the sine function completes a half-period, but since we're looking for zeros, each time 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0, we get a zero. So, the number of zeros is the number of times 1/x passes through multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000.\n\nWait, but that's the same as the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which is the same as n between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which is exactly what we computed before, giving n from 319 to 3183, inclusive, leading to 2865 zeros.\n\nWait, but I just want to make sure that each n corresponds to exactly one zero crossing in the interval. Since the function is continuous and oscillates without damping, each time 1/x passes through n\u03c0, it crosses zero once. So, each n gives exactly one zero crossing. Therefore, the total number is indeed 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think about whether the function could cross zero more than once between two consecutive n's. For example, could there be multiple zeros between n\u03c0 and (n+1)\u03c0? But no, because sin(\u03b8) crosses zero only once between each multiple of \u03c0, as it goes from zero up to 1, back to zero, down to -1, and back to zero. So, each interval between n\u03c0 and (n+1)\u03c0 contains exactly one zero crossing (at n\u03c0). Wait, no, actually, between n\u03c0 and (n+1)\u03c0, sin(\u03b8) crosses zero at n\u03c0, then again at (n+1)\u03c0. But in between, it goes up to 1 and back, so it only crosses zero at the endpoints. So, the zeros are exactly at \u03b8 = n\u03c0, so each n corresponds to exactly one zero crossing.\n\nTherefore, the number of zeros is exactly the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which is n from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 2865 zeros.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm with actual numbers. Let me compute n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.00099784, which is less than 0.001, so included. n=3183: x\u22480.0001000031, which is greater than 0.0001, so included. So, all n from 319 to 3183 are included, and each gives exactly one zero crossing.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me check again: 3183 - 319 +1.\n\nCompute 3183 - 319:\n\n3183 - 300 = 2883\n\n2883 - 19 = 2864\n\nThen, 2864 +1 = 2865.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

Taking reciprocals (and remembering to reverse the inequalities because reciprocating positive numbers reverses the inequality), we get 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which simplifies to 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so dividing all parts by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating those: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be an integer greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184. So, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest integer n is 3183. Thus, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, that confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something else. The function sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches zero, right? And the number of oscillations increases as x gets closer to zero. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is quite close to zero, the function should oscillate rapidly. Each oscillation corresponds to a period of 2\u03c0 in the argument of the sine function, which is 1/x. So, the period in terms of x is a bit tricky because as x decreases, the function's argument 1/x increases, so the function completes more periods as x approaches zero.\n\nBut in terms of x-intercepts, each time the sine function completes a half-period, it crosses zero. So, the number of zeros in the interval (a, b) where 0 < a < b < 1 would be roughly proportional to the difference in the arguments 1/a and 1/b. Specifically, the number of zeros would be approximately (1/a - 1/b)/\u03c0, because each \u03c0 interval in the argument leads to a zero crossing. So, in this case, (1/0.0001 - 1/0.001)/\u03c0 = (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 = 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.197. Wait, that's close to 2866, but my earlier calculation gave me 2865. Hmm, that's a discrepancy of one. So, why is that?\n\nWell, perhaps because when I take the integer parts, I have to be careful about whether to include the endpoints or not. Since the interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), we don't include the endpoints, so perhaps the exact count is the floor of (1/a - 1/b)/\u03c0. Let me compute (1/0.0001 - 1/0.001)/\u03c0 = (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 = 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.197. So, the integer part would be 2866, but since we're dealing with open intervals, maybe it's 2865. Wait, but in my earlier approach, I counted from n=319 to n=3183, which gave me 2865. So, perhaps the formula gives an approximate value, and the exact count is 2865. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the number of zeros is the number of n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001), which is exactly what I did earlier, leading to 2865. So, perhaps the approximate formula gives 2866, but the exact count is 2865 because the endpoints are excluded. So, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when I calculated n from 319 to 3183 inclusive, that's 2865 numbers. But using the formula, (1/a - 1/b)/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.197. So, why the difference of one? Maybe because when I take the difference, I'm including a fractional part, and when I take the integer count, I have to subtract one because the interval is open. Alternatively, perhaps the exact count is floor((1/a - 1/b)/\u03c0). Let me check: floor(2866.197) is 2866, but my count is 2865. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula counts the number of zeros between x = a and x = b as approximately (1/a - 1/b)/\u03c0, but since we're dealing with open intervals, we have to subtract one if the exact count is less than that. Alternatively, maybe the formula is an approximation, and the exact count is 2865, as calculated by considering the integer values of n.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me consider the function f(x) = sin(1/x). The zeros occur at 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, the number of zeros in (a, b) is the number of integers n such that a < 1/(n\u03c0) < b. Which is equivalent to 1/b < n\u03c0 < 1/a, so n must satisfy 1/(b\u03c0) < n < 1/(a\u03c0). Therefore, the number of integers n is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) + 1, but wait, let me see.\n\nWait, actually, the number of integers n satisfying 1/(b\u03c0) < n < 1/(a\u03c0) is equal to floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)).\n\nWait, let me test that with numbers. Let's take a=0.0001, b=0.001.\n\nCompute 1/(a\u03c0) = 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 31830.9886184\n\n1/(b\u03c0) = 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309886184\n\nSo, floor(1/(a\u03c0)) = floor(31830.9886184) = 31830\n\nceil(1/(b\u03c0)) = ceil(318.309886184) = 319\n\nSo, number of integers n is 31830 - 319 + 1? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the number of integers between 318.309886184 and 31830.9886184 is 31830 - 319 + 1. Wait, but that can't be right because 31830 is way larger than our earlier count. Wait, no, I think I'm confusing something here.\n\nWait, no, in our problem, we're only considering n such that x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which corresponds to n between 319 and 3183. But in this calculation, 1/(a\u03c0) is 31830.9886, which is way larger. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the substitution. Wait, in our problem, a = 0.0001 and b = 0.001, but 1/(a\u03c0) is 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, and 1/(b\u03c0) = 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184. So, the number of integers n such that 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184 is floor(3183.09886184) - ceil(318.309886184) + 1 = 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, that's consistent with our earlier calculation. So, the formula gives us 2865, which is correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought about the approximate formula, I got 2866.197, which is about 2866, but our exact count is 2865. So, perhaps the approximate formula is slightly overestimating, but the exact count is 2865.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check with specific numbers. Let's take a smaller interval to see if the formula works. Suppose I have a=0.1 and b=0.2. Then, 1/(a\u03c0) \u2248 3.18309886184, and 1/(b\u03c0) \u2248 1.59154943092. So, the number of integers n such that 1.59154943092 < n < 3.18309886184 is n=2 and n=3. So, that's two integers. Using the formula: floor(3.18309886184) = 3, ceil(1.59154943092) = 2, so 3 - 2 +1 = 2, which is correct. So, the formula works here.\n\nAnother test: a=0.01, b=0.1. Then, 1/(a\u03c0) \u2248 31.8309886184, 1/(b\u03c0) \u2248 3.18309886184. So, integers n from 4 to 31 inclusive. Number of integers: 31 - 4 +1 =28. Using the formula: floor(31.8309886184)=31, ceil(3.18309886184)=4, so 31 -4 +1=28, correct.\n\nSo, applying the same logic, in our problem, the number of integers n is 3183 -319 +1=2865, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about the approximate formula giving 2866, but perhaps that's because the exact count is 2865, which is one less than the approximate value. So, that seems to align.\n\nWait, perhaps the approximate formula is (1/a - 1/b)/\u03c0, which is (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 = 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.197, which is about 2866. But the exact count is 2865, which is one less. That's because the formula counts the number of intervals between the zeros, whereas the exact count is the number of zeros, which is one less than the number of intervals. Wait, no, actually, each zero is a point, so perhaps the formula is an approximation that includes a fractional part, but the exact count is the integer part. Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, in any case, since we've done the exact calculation by considering the integer values of n, and arrived at 2865, that should be the correct answer.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. The function y = sin(1/x) has zeros where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0).\n\n2. We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\n3. Solving for n gives 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184.\n\n4. The integers n in this range are from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\n5. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nThe function \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) has x-intercepts where \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\).

I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me think about the function sin(1/x). As x approaches 0 from the positive side, 1/x approaches infinity, and sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a small interval near zero, the function will oscillate very rapidly. Each time 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0, the function crosses zero. So, each zero crossing corresponds to a value of x where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001, n increases from 319 to 3183. Therefore, each n in that range corresponds to exactly one zero crossing in the interval. So, the count is indeed 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me consider another approach. The function sin(1/x) has zeros at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, in the interval (a, b), where a = 0.0001 and b = 0.001, the number of zeros is the number of integers n for which 1/(n\u03c0) is in (a, b). So, 1/(n\u03c0) > a \u21d2 n < 1/(a\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, and 1/(n\u03c0) < b \u21d2 n > 1/(b\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. So, n must satisfy 318.309 < n < 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, that's consistent with what I found earlier.

Therefore, the answer should be 2865. But wait, let me think again: as x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. But in our case, we're looking at x between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a finite interval, but the function still oscillates rapidly as x approaches 0.0001. So, each time 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0, we get an x-intercept. So, the number of times sin(1/x) crosses zero in that interval is equal to the number of integers n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) lies in (0.0001, 0.001). Which we've already calculated as 2865.
