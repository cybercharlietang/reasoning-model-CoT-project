    "text": " So, 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that's the number of x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the final answer is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again: the function sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times as x approaches 0. But in this case, our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is a finite interval, albeit very close to zero. So, the number of zeros should be finite. Each zero occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0), so each n corresponds to a zero crossing. So, the count we did earlier should be correct. But just to make sure, perhaps I can compute the approximate number of zeros by considering the interval length. The interval is from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is a length of 0.0009. The function sin(1/x) has a period of 2\u03c0/(1/x) as x changes, but since x is changing, the period in terms of x is a bit tricky. Alternatively, the number of zeros can be approximated by the difference in 1/(n\u03c0) across the interval. Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to consider the number of times 1/x passes through multiples of \u03c0 as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001. So, when x decreases, 1/x increases. So, the number of zeros is the number of times 1/x crosses n\u03c0 for integer n, as x moves from 0.001 to 0.0001. So, the smallest 1/x is 1000 (since x=0.001), and the largest 1/x is 10000 (since x=0.0001). Therefore, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. So, the number of times 1/x crosses n\u03c0 is the number of integers n such that n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating those: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is exactly what we found earlier. Therefore, the number of n's is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nBut wait, let me check one more thing: when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.00099784, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. When n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001000031, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval. Therefore, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive correspond to x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, the count is indeed 2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where the function equals zero. The sine function is zero when its argument is an integer multiple of \\( \\pi \\), i.e., \\( \\sin \\theta = 0 \\) when \\( \\theta = n\\pi \\) for some integer \\( n \\). Therefore, \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\) when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\), which implies \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n\nWe need to find the range of \\( n \\) such that \\( x \\) lies within the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\). This translates to the inequalities:\n\\[ 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\]\n\nSolving these inequalities for \\( n \\):\n1. From \\( 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\):\n   \\[ n < \\frac{1}{0.0001 \\pi} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.000314159} \\approx 3183.098 \\]\n\n2.

The number of integers in this range is calculated as:\n\\[ 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\) is \\(\\boxed{2865}\\)."

    "text": " So, 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, I think that's the correct number of x-intercepts. Therefore, the graph of y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me think again about the interval. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. So, between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a very small interval near zero, the function oscillates infinitely many times. But in our case, we're looking for the number of zeros in that interval, which are at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer n. So, as n increases, x decreases towards zero. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), the corresponding n values are from 319 to 3183, as we found. Each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept in that interval. So, the total number is 2865. Therefore, the answer is 2865.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, perhaps I can check with a smaller interval to see if the formula works. Let's say I take an interval where I know the number of zeros. Suppose I take x between 0.1 and 0.2. Then, 1/x would be between 5 and 10. So, sin(1/x) would have zeros when 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, for x between 0.1 and 0.2, 1/x is between 5 and 10. So, n\u03c0 must be between 5 and 10. Therefore, n must satisfy 5 < n\u03c0 < 10, so n must be between 5/\u03c0 \u2248 1.5915 and 10/\u03c0 \u2248 3.1831. So, n can be 2 or 3. Therefore, the zeros would be at x = 1/(2\u03c0) \u2248 0.15915 and x = 1/(3\u03c0) \u2248 0.10610. Wait, but 0.10610 is less than 0.1, so it's not in (0.1, 0.2). Wait, that contradicts, so perhaps my approach is wrong. Wait, no, because if 1/x is between 5 and 10, then n\u03c0 must be between 5 and 10, so n must be 2 (since 2\u03c0 \u22486.2832) and 3\u03c0\u22489.4248. So, x = 1/(2\u03c0) \u22480.15915 is within (0.1, 0.2), and x=1/(3\u03c0)\u22480.10610 is less than 0.1, so not in the interval. So, only one zero in (0.1, 0.2). So, according to our formula, the number of zeros would be the number of n such that 0.1 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.2. Which translates to 5 < n\u03c0 < 10, so n between 5/\u03c0\u22481.5915 and 10/\u03c0\u22483.1831. So, n=2 and n=3. But x=1/(2\u03c0)\u22480.15915 is in (0.1, 0.2), but x=1/(3\u03c0)\u22480.10610 is not, as it's less than 0.1. So, only n=2 gives a zero in (0.1, 0.2). Therefore, the count is 1. But according to our formula, the number of n would be floor(10/\u03c0) - ceil(5/\u03c0) +1. So, floor(10/\u03c0)=3, ceil(5/\u03c0)=2. So, 3 - 2 +1=2. But we know only one zero is in the interval. So, that suggests that our formula overcounts by 1 in this case. So, perhaps our formula isn't perfect. Wait, but in our original problem, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001000031, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval. Similarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.00099784, which is just below 0.001, so included. But in the smaller example, n=3 gives x\u22480.10610, which is just below 0.1, so excluded from the open interval (0.1, 0.2). So, in that case, our formula counts n=2 and n=3, but only n=2 is valid. So, perhaps we need to adjust the formula to ensure that x is strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. So, perhaps instead of just taking n > 318.309 and n < 3183.098, we should check whether 1/(n\u03c0) is strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. So, in the smaller example, n=3 gives x\u22480.10610, which is less than 0.1, so not included. So, in our original problem, we need to make sure that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, perhaps the correct approach is to find the range of n such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, solving for n: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u22483183.098862 So, n must be less than approximately 3183.098862, so the maximum integer n is 3183. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248318.3098862 So, n must be greater than approximately 318.3098862, so the minimum integer n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. But in the smaller example, using n=2 and n=3, but only n=2 gives x in (0.1, 0.2). So, why does our formula give 2, but actual count is 1? Because when n=3, x=1/(3\u03c0)\u22480.10610, which is less than 0.1, so not in the interval. So, perhaps in our original problem, we need to ensure that x=1/(n\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. So, perhaps we should adjust the lower bound for n. Let me think: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u22483183.098862 So, n can be up to 3183. But also, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n > 318.3098862. So, n starts at 319. So, the number of n is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. But in the smaller example, this approach overcounts by 1 because n=3 gives x=0.10610, which is less than 0.1, so not in the interval. So, perhaps in the original problem, we need to check whether 1/(319\u03c0) is less than 0.001 and 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Let me check: 1/(319\u03c0) \u22480.00099784 < 0.001, so included. 1/(3183\u03c0) \u22480.0001000031 > 0.0001, so included. So, in the original problem, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive give x in (0.0001, 0.001). But in the smaller example, n=3 gives x=0.10610 <0.1, so not included. So, perhaps in the original problem, all n from 319 to 3183 give x in (0.0001, 0.001), but in the smaller example, n=3 doesn't. So, why is that? Because in the original problem, n=319 gives x\u22480.00099784 <0.001, which is included, and n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001000031 >0.0001, included. But in the smaller example, n=3 gives x\u22480.10610 <0.1, so excluded. So, perhaps in the original problem, the lower bound n=319 gives x just below 0.001, and the upper bound n=3183 gives x just above 0.0001, so both are included. Therefore, the count is correct. Whereas in the smaller example, n=3 gives x below the lower bound, so it's excluded, hence the count is one less. So, in our original problem, the count is accurate as 2865.\n\nWait, but let me just think again: in the original problem, the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), open. So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, for x = 1/(n\u03c0), we need 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, solving for n: 1/(0.001) > n\u03c0 > 1/(0.0001) => 1000 > n\u03c0 > 10000 => 1000/\u03c0 > n > 10000/\u03c0. Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, no, let me correct that. If 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, then taking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities because reciprocals reverse the order for positive numbers): 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001 => 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, dividing by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating those: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098862, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098862. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.3098862 and less than approximately 3183.098862. Therefore, n is an integer from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the smaller example, when I took (0.1, 0.2), the corresponding n would be such that 5 < n\u03c0 <10, so n between 5/\u03c0\u22481.5915 and 10/\u03c0\u22483.1831. So, n=2 and n=3. But x=1/(2\u03c0)\u22480.15915 is in (0.1, 0.2), and x=1/(3\u03c0)\u22480.10610 is not. So, only n=2 is valid. So, why does our formula give 2, but actual count is 1? Because when n=3, x=1/(3\u03c0)\u22480.10610 <0.1, so excluded. Therefore, in that case, our formula overcounts. So, perhaps in the original problem, we need to ensure that both endpoints are included. But in our original problem, n=319 gives x\u22480.00099784 <0.001, which is included, and n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001000031 >0.0001, which is included. So, in that case, both endpoints are included, so the count is accurate. But in the smaller example, n=3 gives x\u22480.10610 <0.1, so excluded, so the count is one less. So, perhaps in the original problem, the count is correct, but in the smaller example, it's not. So, perhaps our formula works when the lower bound of n\u03c0 is such that 1/(n\u03c0) is greater than the lower interval bound, and similarly for the upper bound. So, in the original problem, since n=319 gives x\u22480.00099784 <0.001, which is included, and n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001000031 >0.0001, included. So, the count is accurate. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). To find the number of such x in (0.0001, 0.001), we solve for n:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001  \n\u2192 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000  \n\u2192 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098\n\nn ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers is:\n\n3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865\n\nThus, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

Therefore, the graph of y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but let me just think again: each x-intercept corresponds to a zero crossing of sin(1/x). The function sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches zero, with the oscillations becoming more frequent. In the interval from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is from x=0.0001 to x=0.001, the function sin(1/x) will oscillate between -1 and 1, crossing zero each time 1/x passes through an integer multiple of \u03c0. So, each time 1/x = n\u03c0, which gives x=1/(n\u03c0), as I had earlier. So, the number of zeros in that interval is the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is between 0.0001 and 0.001. Which again leads me to n between approximately 318.309 and 3183.098. So, n from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 2865 integers. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough.

Let me consider whether the endpoints are included or not. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. However, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000031, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. Similarly, when n=319, x\u22480.00099784, which is just below 0.001, so it's included. Therefore, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive correspond to x in (0.0001, 0.001). Thus, the count is indeed 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check with n=318: x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.5304) \u2248 0.00099947, which is greater than 0.001? Wait, no, 0.00099947 is less than 0.001, so it's still within the interval. Wait, but according to our earlier calculation, n must be greater than approximately 318.309, so n=319 is the first integer. So, n=318 would give x\u22480.00099947, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval. Wait, but according to our initial inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=319 is the first integer. Therefore, n=318 is excluded because it's less than 318.309. Wait, but when n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.00099947, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. But according to our earlier calculation, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=319 is the smallest integer. Therefore, n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.00099947, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval. Wait, but according to our initial inequality, n > 318.309, so n=319 is the first integer. Therefore, n=318 is excluded. But when n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.00099947, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial inequality.\n\nWait, let's go back. The initial inequality was 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which implies n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, meaning the smallest integer n is 319. So, n=318 is less than 318.309, so it's excluded. Therefore, n=318 is excluded, and n=319 is included. Therefore, the count is from 319 to 3183, which is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check n=318: x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.00099947, which is less than 0.001, so it's in the interval. But according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is less than that, so it's excluded. Therefore, n=318 is excluded, even though x=1/(318\u03c0) is within the interval. Wait, that seems contradictory. Let me check the inequality again.\n\nWe have x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nSo, solving for n:\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001:\n\nn < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001:\n\nn > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309\n\nSo, n must satisfy 318.309 < n < 3183.098.\n\nSince n must be an integer, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nSo, n=318 is less than 318.309, so it's excluded, even though x=1/(318\u03c0) is within the interval. Therefore, the count is from 319 to 3183, which is 2865.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit counterintuitive because n=318 gives x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.00099947, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. But according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is excluded. Therefore, the count starts at n=319.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nI think that's correct.
