    "text": " So, n < approximately 3183.098. Since n is an integer, the maximum possible n is 3183. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) Calculating the right side: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.309 So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309. Since n is an integer, the smallest possible n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1. Wait, no, actually, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, in this case, it's 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a lot. Let me verify the range for n again. The lower bound: x = 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, so n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so n_max = 3183. The upper bound: x = 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, so n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309, so n_min = 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, yes, 2865 seems correct. Wait, but let me think about whether each n in that range corresponds to exactly one x-intercept in the interval. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0) is a strictly decreasing function as n increases, each n gives a unique x in the interval, and they are all distinct. So, each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept. Therefore, the total number is indeed 2865. Hmm, that seems like a lot, but considering the interval is very small near zero, the function oscillates rapidly, so it makes sense that there are so many x-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n.

Similarly, for the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) Calculating the right side: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.3098 So, n > approximately 318.3098. Since n has to be an integer, n must satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Now, let's find how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is given by b - a + 1. So, plugging in the values: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems too high. Let me check my calculations again. Hmm, 3183 - 319 is indeed 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. But let me make sure that both endpoints are included correctly. Since n must be greater than 318.3098, the smallest integer n is 319. Similarly, n must be less than 3183.0988, so the largest integer n is 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, that suggests there are 2865 x-intercepts in that interval. But wait, let me think again. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0, right? So, between 0.0001 and 0.001, it's going to oscillate a lot. But is 2865 the correct number? Let me cross-verify. The interval from 0.0001 to 0.001 in terms of 1/x is from 1000 to 10000. Because when x is 0.001, 1/x is 1000, and when x is 0.0001, 1/x is 10000. So, the function sin(1/x) is equivalent to sin(z) where z goes from 1000 to 10000. So, how many times does sin(z) cross zero between z=1000 and z=10000? Well, sin(z) is zero at every integer multiple of \u03c0. So, the zeros are at z = n\u03c0 for integer n. So, the number of zeros between 1000 and 10000 is the number of integers n such that 1000 \u2264 n\u03c0 \u2264 10000. So, solving for n, we have n \u2265 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098, and n \u2264 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but just to make sure, let's consider that each zero crossing corresponds to an x-intercept. Since sin(z) crosses zero once every \u03c0 interval, the number of crossings between z=1000 and z=10000 is approximately (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0, which is 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866. But my earlier calculation gave 2865. Hmm, the difference is 1. Let me check: 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. But 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988, so n can be up to 3183. Similarly, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098, so n starts at 319. So, from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of terms is 3183 - 319 +1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 -19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2865. So, 2865 is correct. But the approximate value using (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 \u2248 9000/3.1416 \u2248 2866. So, why is there a discrepancy of 1? Maybe because when we take the floor and ceiling, sometimes it's off by one. Let me see: n starts at 319 because 318.3098 is less than 319. So, the first n is 319, and the last n is 3183 because 3183.0988 is just over 3183, so 3183 is included. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Therefore, the exact number is 2865. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe number of x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is determined by finding the integer values of n such that 1/(n\u03c0) lies within the interval. This results in n ranging from 319 to 3183, inclusive, giving a total of 2865 intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, 1/x \u2208 (1000, 10000). Since sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n must be between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0.

Let me double-check the bounds for n. So, starting with x = 1/(n\u03c0) being greater than 0.0001: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098.

Similarly, n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0) which is just below 0.001. So, both n=319 and n=3183 correspond to x-values within the interval (0.0001, 0.001).

So, both n=319 and n=3183 are valid, so the count is indeed 2865.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check if n=3183 gives x just above 0.0001. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000.000000000001) \u2248 0.0001, but slightly less, which is 0.00009999999999999999, which is indeed just above 0.0001? Wait, no, 0.000099999... is 0.0000999... which is 0.00009999999999999999, which is less than 0.0001, because 0.0001 is 0.00010000000000000000. So, wait, that would mean that n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999999999999999, which is less than 0.0001, so actually outside the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, that's a problem. So, I think I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, because 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 1/(10000.000000000001) which is approximately 0.00009999999999999999, which is 0.000099999... which is less than 0.0001. So, that would mean that x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's not in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, that would mean that n=3183 is too big, because x would be less than 0.0001, which is outside the interval. So, perhaps I need to adjust the upper bound for n.\n\nWait, so let me recast the inequality. We have x > 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. Solving for n: n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999999999999999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's actually not in the interval. Therefore, the maximum n that gives x > 0.0001 is n=3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.000000000001 - something), which would be just above 0.0001.\n\nWait, let me compute 1/(3182\u03c0). 3182\u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 182\u03c0 \u2248 571.5874, so total \u2248 9424.77796 + 571.5874 \u2248 9996.36536. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.36536 \u2248 0.00010003654, which is approximately 0.00010003654, which is just above 0.0001, so it's within the interval. So, n=3182 gives x\u22480.00010003654, which is in (0.0001, 0.001). So, the maximum n is 3182, not 3183.\n\nSimilarly, let's check n=3183: 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000.000000000001) \u2248 0.00009999999999999999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. So, n=3183 is excluded. So, the upper bound for n is 3182.\n\nSimilarly, let's check n=319: 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1004.468) \u2248 0.0009956, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, the lower bound is n=319, upper bound is n=3182. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but after correcting the upper bound, it's 2864. Hmm, let me verify again.\n\nSo, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, if a=319, b=3182, then 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check with n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010003654, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. And n=319: x\u22480.0009956, which is less than 0.001, so included. So, from n=319 to n=3182, inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of terms is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with smaller numbers to see if the formula works. For example, from n=1 to n=3, inclusive, how many numbers? 3 - 1 + 1 = 3, which is correct: 1,2,3. So, yes, the formula works.\n\nSo, in this case, it's 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but let me also check what n=3182 gives. 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000.000000000001) \u2248 0.00009999999999999999, which is just under 0.0001, but wait, that's not correct because earlier I thought 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9996.36536, so 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.36536 \u2248 0.00010003654, which is just over 0.0001. So, that's correct, so n=3182 is included.\n\nWait, but if 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9996.36536, then 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010003654, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. So, n=3182 is the last n where x is just above 0.0001.\n\nSimilarly, n=3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.000000000001, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999999999999999, which is less than 0.0001, so excluded.\n\nSo, the maximum n is 3182, so the number of x-intercepts is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n=3182 gives x\u22480.00010003654, which is in the interval, so it's included. So, yes, 2864 is the correct count.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial calculation. So, the number of integers between 319 and 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 minus 319 is 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as starting from n=1 up to n=3182, which would give 3182 numbers, and then subtracting the numbers from n=1 to n=318, which is 318 numbers, so 3182 - 318 = 2864. That also gives the same result. So, that's another way to see it.\n\nWait, but let me check that: from n=1 to n=3182, that's 3182 numbers. From n=1 to n=318, that's 318 numbers. So, from n=319 to n=3182, that's 3182 - 318 = 2864 numbers. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 3183 was included, but that was a mistake because n=3183 gives x less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, the correct count is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check if n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009956, which is less than 0.001, so included. And n=3182 gives x\u22480.00010003654, which is greater than 0.0001, so included. So, yes, from 319 to 3182 inclusive, that's 2864 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a miscalculation in the initial bounds. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n can be up to 3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999999999999999, which is less than 0.0001, so excluded. So, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nSimilarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309, so n starts at 319.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought n=3182 gives x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010003654, which is just above 0.0001, so included. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, to summarize, the function y = sin(1/x) has an x-intercept at every x = 1/(n\u03c0), where n is a positive integer. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), these x-intercepts occur when n is between 319 and 3182 inclusive. The number of such integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts in that interval is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I didn't miscount by considering the endpoints. So, n=319 gives x\u22480.0009956, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. n=3182 gives x\u22480.00010003654, which is greater than 0.0001, so included. So, both endpoints are included, so the count is correct.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another way to compute it. The number of zeros is the number of times the sine function completes a full cycle as x approaches zero. But in this case, since we're dealing with a specific interval, it's better to stick with the earlier method.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute the number of zeros by considering the behavior of 1/x. As x approaches zero from the right, 1/x approaches infinity. So, sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly as x approaches zero. Each time 1/x increases by 2\u03c0, the sine function completes a full cycle, crossing zero twice (once going up and once going down). But wait, no, actually, each full cycle of 2\u03c0 would cross zero twice, but in our case, we're looking for all zeros, so each zero occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0, so each zero corresponds to a distinct n. So, the number of zeros in the interval (a, b) would be the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (a, b). So, that's exactly what we did earlier.\n\nSo, in this case, a=0.0001 and b=0.001. So, the number of integers n where 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001) is the same as the number of n where n is in (1/(0.001\u03c0), 1/(0.0001\u03c0)) which is (approx) (318.309, 3183.098). So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 2864 integers.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but just to make absolutely sure, let me compute 3182 - 319 + 1 again. 3182 minus 319 is 2863, plus 1 is 2864. Yes, that's correct.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. So, the final answer is 2864 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n</think>\n\nThe function \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) has x-intercepts where \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\). This occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for integer \\( n \\), so \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n\nTo find the number of such \\( x \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we solve:\n\\[ 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ 1000 < n\\pi < 10000 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{1000}{\\pi} < n < \\frac{10000}{\\pi} \\]\n\\[ 318.31 < n < 3183.098 \\]\n\nThus, \\( n \\) ranges from 319 to 3182, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is:\n\\[ 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864 \\]\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\(\\boxed{2864}\\)."

Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, applying that here: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 = 2864; 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n in that range, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 3183 minus 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the initial steps. Let me recap:\n\n1. The function y = sin(1/x) has zeros where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0).\n2. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is between 1/10000 and 1/1000.\n3. So, 1/(n\u03c0) must be between 1/1000 and 1/10000, which implies n must be between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which are approximately 318.309 and 3183.098.\n4. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive.\n5. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nYes, that all checks out.

So, when x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. Now, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000. Therefore, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing all parts by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating those: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098.

Since n must be an integer, the smallest integer n can be is 319.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is given by b - a + 1. So, plugging in the numbers: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, let me double-check that subtraction. 3183 minus 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865. So, that suggests there are 2865 integer values of n in that range, each corresponding to an x-intercept in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nBut wait, I should make sure that x = 1/(n\u03c0) is indeed within (0.0001, 0.001) for n from 319 to 3183. Let me test the endpoints. For n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.37) \u2248 0.0009976, which is just below 0.001, so it's within the interval. For n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.003) \u2248 0.000099999, which is just above 0.0001, so it's also within the interval. So, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive give x in (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but let me check if n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0) which is approximately 0.0009976, which is indeed less than 0.001, so that's correct. Similarly, n=3183 gives x\u22480.000099999, which is greater than 0.0001, so that's also correct.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is the number of integers from 319 to 3183, inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the range. Let me calculate 3183 - 319. 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then minus 19 more is 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, leading to x = 1/(n\u03c0). Within (0.0001, 0.001), n ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

    "text": "8 So, n < approximately 3183.0988. Since n must be an integer, the maximum integer n can be is 3183. Now, let's take the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) Calculating the right side: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.3098 So, n > approximately 318.3098. Since n must be an integer, the smallest integer n can be is 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 319 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems like a lot of intercepts. Let me check my calculations again. First, when x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000 radians. Now, sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 is an integer multiple of \u03c0, so \u03b8 = n\u03c0 where n is an integer. Therefore, in the interval \u03b8 \u2208 (1000, 10000), the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988. Therefore, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 x-intercepts in that interval. Wait, but I need to make sure that 1/(n\u03c0) is indeed within (0.0001, 0.001). Let me check for n=319: 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.9) \u2248 0.000997, which is just under 0.001, so that's good. For n=3183: 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000, 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is just under 0.0001, which is outside the interval. Wait, that means n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but our interval starts at 0.0001, so does x=0.0001 count? The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x=0.0001 is not included. Therefore, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is just below 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the maximum n that gives x > 0.0001 is when 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, so n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988, so n can be up to 3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001, which is not included. So, perhaps n goes up to 3182? Let me check: 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000 - \u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000 - 3.1416) \u2248 1/9996.8584 \u2248 0.00010003, which is just over 0.0001, so that's included. So, n can be from 319 up to 3182. Therefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 +1 = 2864. So, there are 2864 x-intercepts. Wait, but earlier I thought n could go up to 3183, but since n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001, which is excluded, so the maximum n is 3182. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Hmm, but let me double-check the calculations to be sure. Let's compute 1/(319\u03c0): \u03c0\u22483.14159265, so 319\u03c0\u2248319*3.14159265\u22481002.929. So, 1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.000997, which is less than 0.001, so that's good. For n=3182: 3182\u03c0\u22483182*3.14159265\u224810000 - (3183\u03c0 - 10000). Wait, perhaps it's better to compute 3182\u03c0: 3182*3.14159265\u22483182*3=9546, 3182*0.14159265\u22483182*0.1=318.2, 3182*0.04159265\u2248132.3, so total\u22489546 + 318.2 + 132.3\u22489996.5. So, 3182\u03c0\u22489996.5, so 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22481/9996.5\u22480.000100035, which is just over 0.0001, so x=0.000100035 is included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3182 is included. Now, n=3183: 3183\u03c0\u22483183*3.14159265\u22483183*3=9549, 3183*0.14159265\u22483183*0.1=318.3, 3183*0.04159265\u2248132.3, so total\u22489549 + 318.3 + 132.3\u22489999.6. So, 3183\u03c0\u22489999.6, so 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22481/9999.6\u22480.000100004, which is just over 0.0001. Wait, but earlier I thought it was just under, but actually, 3183\u03c0\u22489999.6, so 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000100004, which is just over 0.0001, so x=0.000100004 is included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Hmm, so perhaps n=3183 is included. Wait, but 0.0001 is the lower bound, and it's open, so x must be greater than 0.0001. So, 0.000100004 is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, n can go up to 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 +1 = 2865. So, that suggests there are 2865 x-intercepts. But wait, earlier I thought n=3183 gives x\u22480.000100004, which is included, so that's correct. Therefore, the total number is 2865. Wait, but let me check the endpoints again. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, for n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000100004, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. For n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.000997, which is less than 0.001, so included. So, both endpoints are included. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which gives 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865 intercepts. Wait, but earlier I thought that n=3183 gives x\u22480.000100004, which is just barely over 0.0001, so it's included. So, the count is 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the range. Let me compute the exact values. Let's compute 1000/\u03c0: 1000/3.14159265\u2248318.3098861. So, n must be greater than 318.3098861, so the smallest integer n is 319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.098861. So, n must be less than 3183.098861, so the largest integer n is 3183. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, yes, 2865 x-intercepts. Therefore, the answer is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). To find x in (0.0001, 0.001), we solve 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, leading to 318.31 < n < 3183.09. The integers n range from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

    "text": ". So, n < approximately 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, the maximum possible value for n is 3183. Now, let's take the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) Calculating the right side: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.309. So, n > approximately 318.309. Since n must be an integer, the minimum possible value for n is 319. Now, n must be an integer between 319 and 3183, inclusive. So, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Let me compute that: 3183 - 318 = 2865, then 2865 + 1 = 2866. Wait, that seems off. Wait, no, actually, 3183 - 318 is 2865, but since we're starting at 319, which is 318 +1, the number of integers is 3183 - 318 = 2865, but since both ends are included, it's 3183 - 318 +1 = 2866. Wait, but let me check: If n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 +1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 +1 = 2865. Hmm, now I'm confused because two different methods are giving me 2866 and 2865. Let me think again. The formula for the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a +1. So, a is 319, b is 3183. So, 3183 - 319 +1 = 3183 -319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, the number of integers is 2865. Wait, but let me check with a smaller example. Suppose a=2, b=5. The numbers are 2,3,4,5: that's 4 numbers. Using the formula: 5-2+1=4. Correct. So, applying that, 3183 -319 +1=2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that 319 \u2264n \u22643183. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me just confirm the calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake with the inequalities. So, starting with x in (0.0001, 0.001), which is the same as (1/10000, 1/1000). So, 1/(n\u03c0) must be between 1/10000 and 1/1000. Therefore, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing through by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 <n <10000/\u03c0. Calculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248318.309, so n must be greater than 318.309, so n starts at 319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.098, so n must be less than 3183.098, so n goes up to 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 -319 +1=2865.

Now, let's take the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) Calculating the right side: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.3098862 So, n > approximately 318.3098862. Since n must be an integer, the minimum possible n is 319. So, n must be an integer such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Now, to find the number of integers in this range, we can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me calculate that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems too high. Let me check my calculations again. Hmm, 3183 - 319 is actually 2864, right? Because 3183 - 300 would be 2883, then subtract 19 more gives 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, but wait, does n start at 319 and go up to 3183? Let me confirm. When n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.69) \u2248 0.000997, which is just above 0.0001? Wait, no, 0.000997 is 0.000997, which is 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, but is it greater than 0.0001? Yes, because 0.0001 is 0.0001, and 0.000997 is 0.000997, which is larger. So, n=319 gives x\u22480.000997, which is within the interval. Similarly, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.09) \u2248 0.00009999, which is just below 0.0001, but wait, our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001. So, does n=3183 give x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. Therefore, the maximum n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is when 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098862. So, the maximum integer n is 3183, but we need to check if x=1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.09) \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so n=3183 is actually too small because x would be less than 0.0001, which is the lower bound. So, we need to find the smallest n such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. Let me solve for n: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098862. But since n must be an integer, the maximum n is 3183, but we need to ensure that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, let's solve for n: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098862. So, n can be up to 3183, but we need to check if 1/(3183\u03c0) > 0.0001. Let's compute 1/(3183\u03c0): 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000.09, so 1/10000.09 \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001. Therefore, n=3183 gives x\u22480.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the maximum n is actually 3182. Let me check n=3182: 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182*3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000 - 3.1416) \u2248 1/9996.8584 \u2248 0.00010003, which is just above 0.0001. So, n=3182 gives x\u22480.00010003, which is within the interval. Therefore, the range of n is from 319 to 3182, inclusive. Now, let's calculate the number of integers between 319 and 3182, inclusive. The formula is (upper - lower) + 1. So, 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 + 1 = 2864. Wait, that's different from my earlier calculation. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by including n=3183, which actually gives x below 0.0001. So, the correct upper bound is n=3182. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. But wait, let me double-check. Let me compute 3182 - 319 + 1. 3182 - 319 is 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, there are 2864 integers n from 319 to 3182, inclusive. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me re-express the inequalities. We have x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let's invert all parts, remembering that inverting reverses the inequalities since all terms are positive. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Then, dividing by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating these: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098862, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098862. So, n must be greater than 318.3098862 and less than 3183.098862. Since n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. Wait, but earlier I thought n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. So, perhaps I need to adjust the upper bound. Let me check: For n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because n=3182 gives x\u22480.00010003, which is just above 0.0001. Therefore, the correct range is n=319 to n=3182. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but let me confirm with another approach. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. The number of zeros between a and b is roughly the number of times 1/x passes through multiples of \u03c0 as x decreases from b to a. So, the number of zeros is approximately the number of n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is between a and b. So, in this case, a=0.0001 and b=0.001. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n where 1/(n\u03c0) is between 0.0001 and 0.001. Which is the same as n between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.31 to 3183.098. So, the number of integers is floor(3183.098) - ceil(318.31) + 1. Which is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but earlier I thought n=3183 gives x below 0.0001, so maybe I need to subtract 1. So, perhaps the correct count is 2864. Hmm, this is confusing. Let me try plugging in n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. So, the number of integers is from 319 to 3182, inclusive. So, 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but let me check with a specific example. Let's take n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22481/(1002.69)\u22480.000997, which is within (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22481/(10000 - something)\u22480.00010003, which is just above 0.0001. So, n=3182 is included, and n=3183 is excluded. Therefore, the count is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864. So, I think the correct answer is 2864. Wait, but earlier when I did 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.098862, so n can be up to 3183, but n=3183 gives x\u22480.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, and the minimum n is 319. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.

    "text": ". So, n < approximately 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, the maximum possible value for n is 3183. Now, let's take the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) Calculating the right side: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.309. So, n > approximately 318.309. Since n must be an integer, the smallest possible value for n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the values: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 = 2864; 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again. Wait, 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, but let me think again. Each n corresponds to a unique x in the interval, so the number of x-intercepts should be equal to the number of integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. But wait, I should confirm the exact values. Let me compute 1/(319\u03c0) and 1/(3183\u03c0) to make sure they lie within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Calculating 1/(319\u03c0): 319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 1004. So, 1/1004 \u2248 0.000996, which is just under 0.001. Wait, but 0.000996 is less than 0.001, so 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000996, which is within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Now, 1/(3183\u03c0): 3183\u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000. So, 1/10000 = 0.0001, which is the lower bound. But since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so 1/(3183\u03c0) = 0.0001 exactly, which is not included. Therefore, the smallest n is 319 because n=319 gives x\u22480.000996 which is within the interval. Wait, no, 0.000996 is less than 0.001, so it's within the upper bound. Now, n=319 gives x\u22480.000996, which is within (0.0001, 0.001). But wait, 0.000996 is less than 0.001, so that's fine. Now, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, but since the interval is open at 0.0001, we need to check if 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Let's compute 1/(3183\u03c0): 3183\u03c0\u224810000, so 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001. But 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000 because \u03c0\u22483.14159265, so 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265. Let me compute that more accurately. 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.14159265 \u2248 3183 * 0.1416 \u2248 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.0416 \u2248 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, 3183 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0928. Adding those up: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.0928 \u2248 450.7128. So, total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9549 + 450.7128 \u2248 9999.7128. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.7128 \u2248 0.0001000028. So, that's just slightly above 0.0001, which is within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 is included because x\u22480.0001000028 is just above 0.0001. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183, inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 = 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 x-intercepts. Wait, but let me check if n=3183 is included. Since 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001000028, which is just above 0.0001, so yes, it's included in the interval. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me think again. Alternatively, the number of zeros can be found by considering how many times 1/x passes through multiples of \u03c0 as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001. Each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the sine function completes a half-period, leading to a zero crossing. So, the number of zeros is approximately the difference between 1/(0.001\u03c0) and 1/(0.0001\u03c0), which is 1000/\u03c0 - 10000/\u03c0 = (1000 - 10000)/\u03c0 = -9000/\u03c0, but since we're taking the absolute value, it's 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.198. But since we're dealing with integers, it's about 2866. But wait, that's close to 2865, which I got earlier. So, maybe I made a miscalculation in the exact range. Wait, 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Solving for x, we get x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nThis leads to:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098\n\nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.

Starting with x = 1/(n\u03c0) in (0.0001, 0.001). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me solve for n in both inequalities. First inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Taking reciprocals (and reversing the inequality): n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001 = 10000. So, n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, which gives n \u2264 3183 as before. Second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.

So, my answer of 2865 seems plausible. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Alternatively, the function y = sin(1/x) has a period of 2\u03c0/(1/x) = 2\u03c0x. But as x decreases, the period decreases, meaning the function oscillates more rapidly. However, to find the number of zeros, I can consider how many times 1/x passes through multiples of \u03c0 as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001. Each time 1/x crosses n\u03c0, where n is an integer, the function sin(1/x) crosses zero. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001).

Similarly, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, divide both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309. Since n must be an integer, n must satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the values: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations. I approximated \u03c0 as 3.1416, but maybe I should use more precise values to ensure accuracy. Let me compute 1/(0.0001\u03c0) more accurately. 0.0001 is 1e-4, so 1/(1e-4 * \u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0. Using \u03c0 \u2248 3.1415926535, so 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than 3183.0988618, so the maximum integer n is 3183. Similarly, 1/(0.001\u03c0) is 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, so the minimum integer n is 319. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1.

Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n.

Now, to find how many integers are in this range, we can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. So, 3183 - 319 is indeed 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. Let me check when n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.19) \u2248 0.0009978, which is just under 0.001, so that's within the interval. For n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.3) \u2248 0.000099996, which is just above 0.0001, so that's also within the interval. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, inclusive. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but that seems like a very large number. Let me think about it again. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. So, in the interval from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is a very small interval near zero, the function will oscillate extremely rapidly. Each oscillation corresponds to a peak and a trough, and between each peak and trough, there's an x-intercept. So, the number of x-intercepts should be proportional to the difference in 1/x over the interval, divided by \u03c0, since each zero crossing occurs every \u03c0 in the argument. Let me try another approach to confirm. Let\u2019s consider the function y = sin(1/x). The zeros occur where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). The interval for x is from 0.0001 to 0.001. Let's find the corresponding n values. For x = 0.001, n = 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309, so n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. For x = 0.0001, n = 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so n must be less than 3183.098, so the largest integer n is 3183. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's correct, but let me just visualize the function a bit. As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates between -1 and 1 infinitely many times. So, in any small interval near zero, there are infinitely many oscillations. But in our case, the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is finite, so the number of zeros should be finite. Our calculation shows 2865 zeros, which is a finite number, so that makes sense. Therefore, I think the answer is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has zeros where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need to find n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n, we find n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

So, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations. Let me compute 3183 - 319 first. 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then minus 19 is 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me check if n=3183 is indeed within the interval. Let's compute x when n=3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0). Let me approximate that. 3183\u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77, 183\u03c0 \u2248 575. So, total is approximately 9424.77 + 575 \u2248 10,000. So, x \u2248 1/10000 = 0.0001. But wait, the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.0001. So, x=0.0001 is not included, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly greater than 0.0001 because 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001, but wait, that would place x just below 0.0001, which is outside the interval. Wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the inequalities. Let me go back. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is x between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, 0.0001 < x < 0.001.\n\nGiven x = 1/(n\u03c0), then 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nLet me solve for n in both inequalities.\n\nFirst inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0)\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0: 0.0001 * n\u03c0 < 1\nThen, n < 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098\n\nSecond inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0\nDivide both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098.\n\nSince n is an integer, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183.\n\nNow, how many integers are between 319 and 3183 inclusive?\n\nCompute 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\n3183 - 319 is 2864, then +1 is 2865.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that x=1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but actually, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 1/(10000) = 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000, 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001, which is just below 0.0001, so x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the upper bound for n should be 3182 instead of 3183.\n\nWait, let me check that. If n=3183, then x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.000...) which is 0.0001. But since 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000, 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. Therefore, n can only go up to 3182.\n\nSimilarly, let's check n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182*3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000 - something). Let me compute 3182*3.1416: 3182 * 3 = 9546, 3182 * 0.1416 \u2248 3182 * 0.1 = 318.2, 3182 * 0.04 = 127.28, 3182 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0912. So total \u2248 9546 + 318.2 + 127.28 + 5.0912 \u2248 9546 + 450.5712 \u2248 9996.5712. So, 1/(9996.5712) \u2248 0.000100035, which is just above 0.0001, so it's within the interval.\n\nTherefore, n=3182 gives x\u22480.000100035, which is inside (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nSimilarly, n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.000...) \u2248 0.000997, which is just below 0.001, so it's inside the interval.\n\nWait, but 319\u03c0 is approximately 319*3.1416 \u2248 1003.000. So, 1/1003 \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's inside the interval.\n\nWait, but 0.000997 is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nSo, n starts at 319 and ends at 3182.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\nCompute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863. Then, add 1: 2864.\n\nWait, that's different from before. Earlier I thought it was 2865, but now it's 2864. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier by including n=3183, which actually gives x just below 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, the correct upper limit is n=3182.\n\nSo, number of x-intercepts is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, let me confirm: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 = 2864.\n\nBut let me check with specific examples. Let me compute for n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000997, which is within (0.0001, 0.001). For n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100035, which is just above 0.0001, so included. So, the number of n's is from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought n went up to 3183, I got 2865, but that was incorrect because n=3183 gives x just below 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, the correct count is 2864.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute it as floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0). Let me see: 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so floor(3183.098) = 3183. But since x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, we need to take n up to 3182.\n\nSimilarly, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so ceil(318.309) = 319.\n\nSo, the number of n's is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another approach. The interval (0.0001, 0.001) corresponds to 1/x between 1000 and 10000. Because if x is 0.001, then 1/x is 1000, and if x is 0.0001, then 1/x is 10000. But since the interval is open, 1/x is in (1000, 10000).\n\nSo, 1/x must be in (1000, 10000). Now, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so n\u03c0 must be in (1000, 10000).\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nDividing all parts by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nWhich is approximately 318.309 < n < 3183.098.\n\nSo, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, but wait, 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10000, so 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.000... So, 3183\u03c0 is exactly 10000? Wait, no, \u03c0 is irrational, so 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.000... something, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but slightly less, so x=1/(3183\u03c0) is just below 0.0001, which is excluded.\n\nTherefore, the maximum n is 3182, because 3182\u03c0 is less than 10000, so 1/(3182\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001, so included.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, number of terms is 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\nCompute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19: 2882 - 19 = 2863, then +1 = 2864.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but that was a mistake because n=3183 gives x just below 0.0001, which is excluded. So, correct count is 2864.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate it as the floor of 10000/\u03c0 minus the ceiling of 1000/\u03c0, plus 1.\n\nWait, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so floor is 3183.\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so ceiling is 319.\n\nSo, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nBut wait, that would include n=3183, which as we saw gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the correct upper limit is 3182, so 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Maybe I should think in terms of the number of zeros of sin(1/x) in the interval (a, b). The function sin(1/x) oscillates increasingly rapidly as x approaches 0. Each period of sin(1/x) corresponds to an increase of \u03c0 in 1/x, so each zero crossing is spaced by \u0394x such that \u0394(1/x) = \u03c0, which means \u0394x = -\u03c0/(x^2). So, as x approaches 0, the spacing between zeros becomes very small.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to consider the number of zeros between 1/x = 1000 and 1/x = 10000, which is n from 319 to 3183, but excluding n=3183 because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.000..., which would make x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound of the interval, but since the interval is open, it's excluded.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182, inclusive, giving 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864 zeros.\n\nWait, but let me check with n=3182: 3182\u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.14159265 \u2248 let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.777, 182\u03c0 \u2248 571.02, so total \u2248 9424.777 + 571.02 \u2248 9995.797. So, 1/(9995.797) \u2248 0.000100042, which is just above 0.0001, so included.\n\nSimilarly, n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 1003.000, so 1/1003 \u2248 0.000997, which is within (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nSo, the number of zeros is indeed 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought n went up to 3183, I thought it was 2865, but that was incorrect because n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so excluded.\n\nTherefore, the correct number is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the subtraction. 3182 - 319 is 2863, and adding 1 gives 2864. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it as floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0). So, floor(10000/\u03c0) is 3183, ceil(1000/\u03c0) is 319. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, but since we're including both endpoints, we need to add 1, making it 2865. But wait, that would include n=3183, which is excluded because x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001. So, perhaps the correct formula is floor(10000/\u03c0) - 1 - ceil(1000/\u03c0) + 1, which would be 3183 -1 -319 +1 = 3183 - 319 -1 +1 = 3183 - 319 = 2864.

So, n must be greater than approximately 318.3098 and less than approximately 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n can take integer values from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to count how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is given by b - a + 1. So, substituting a = 319 and b = 3183, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me calculate that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, and then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n that satisfy the condition. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with the inequalities: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n: For the lower bound: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. For the upper bound: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.3098 and less than approximately 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest is 3183. Now, counting the integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of it as the number of integers between two numbers a and b is floor(b) - ceil(a) + 1. Here, a is approximately 318.3098, so ceil(a) is 319. b is approximately 3183.098, so floor(b) is 3183. Thus, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0, i.e., at x = 1/(n\u03c0).

Since n is an integer, the minimum possible n is 319. Now, n must be an integer between 319 and 3183, inclusive. To find the number of integers in this range, I subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 integer values of n in that range, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check. Sometimes when dealing with inequalities, especially with reciprocals, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me verify the bounds again. So, for x = 1/(n\u03c0), when x is 0.0001, n would be 1/(0.0001 * \u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988618, so n is just below that. Since x must be greater than 0.0001, n must be less than 3183.0988618, so n can be up to 3183. Similarly, when x is 0.001, n is 1/(0.001 * \u03c0) \u2248 318.3098862, so n must be greater than that, meaning the smallest n is 319. So, the range for n is from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865.

Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) Calculating that: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.309 So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309. Since n is an integer, the smallest possible n is 319. Now, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. To find the number of integers in this range, I subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, number of intercepts = 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems like a lot of intercepts. Let me double-check my calculations. The interval is from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is from 1e-4 to 1e-3. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. So, between 1e-4 and 1e-3, the function should have a lot of oscillations, each crossing the x-axis twice (once going up, once going down), except maybe near the ends. But wait, in my earlier reasoning, I only considered when sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs once per period, right? Wait, no, actually, sin(\u03b8) = 0 at every integer multiple of \u03c0, which would be every time \u03b8 increases by \u03c0. So, for each n, we have a zero crossing at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), each x = 1/(n\u03c0) must lie within that interval. So, n must satisfy 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0), which is what I did earlier. So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me think again. Each time x decreases by 1/(n\u03c0) - 1/((n+1)\u03c0), but that's the spacing between consecutive zeros. But in terms of the number of zeros, it's just the count of n's, which is 2865. Alternatively, sometimes people might think about the number of oscillations, but in this case, each zero crossing is a single point, so the number of zeros is indeed equal to the number of n's in that range. So, I think my answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer n.

To find the number of integers n in this range, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add one (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. First, the lower bound: 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309, so n must be at least 319. Upper bound: 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But wait, I should make sure that each n corresponds to a unique x in the interval. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), and as n increases, x decreases. So, starting from n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.15) \u2248 0.0009968, which is just below 0.001. Then, as n increases, x gets smaller, approaching 0.0001 when n approaches 3183, since x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000318, which is less than 0.0001. Wait, no, 0.0000318 is less than 0.0001, so actually, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001. That means the x corresponding to n=3183 is just below 0.0001, so it's not included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, that's a problem. So, when I set x = 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, that gives n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so n must be less than that, meaning n \u2264 3183. But x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0000318, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not in the interval. So, actually, the maximum n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but x for n=3183 is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. So, the actual upper bound for n is the largest integer n where 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. Let me solve 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 for n: n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, the largest integer n is 3183, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10017.5) \u2248 0.0000998, which is still less than 0.0001. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. So, actually, the maximum n where x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3183, but since x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, we need to find the largest n such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. Let me solve for n: n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, the largest integer n is 3183, but as we saw, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the largest n where x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3182. Let me check: x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10017.5) \u2248 0.0000998, which is still less than 0.0001. Hmm, so even n=3182 gives x less than 0.0001. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0): 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10000 = 0.0001. So, actually, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since it's equal to 0.0001, and the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x=0.0001 is not included. Therefore, n must be less than 3183, so n=3182 is the largest integer where x=1/(3182\u03c0) > 0.0001. Let me compute 1/(3182\u03c0): 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000 - \u03c0 \u2248 10000 - 3.1416 \u2248 9996.8584. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.8584 \u2248 0.00010003, which is just above 0.0001. So, that works. So, n can be from 319 up to 3182. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 + 1 = 2864. Wait, so earlier I thought it was 2865, but now it's 2864. Which one is correct? Let me clarify. The x-intercepts occur at x=1/(n\u03c0) where n is an integer. We need x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n: 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0). So, n must be greater than 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309, so n \u2265 319. And n must be less than 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so n \u2264 3183. But x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is not included in the open interval. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3182 - 319 + 1 = 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. Let me make sure. Let me take a smaller example to test. Suppose I have n from 2 to 5 inclusive. How many numbers? 5 - 2 + 1 = 4: 2,3,4,5. Yes, that works. So, in this case, n from 319 to 3182 inclusive: 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. So, the correct number is 2864. Therefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2864 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me think about the behavior of sin(1/x). As x approaches 0 from the positive side, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is between 1/10000 and 1/1000, so 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, sin(1/x) oscillates between -1 and 1, crossing zero whenever 1/x is a multiple of \u03c0. So, each zero crossing corresponds to a value of n where x=1/(n\u03c0). So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, but wait, no, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000, so n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000. Wait, that's another way to think about it. Let me see. 1/x is between 1000 and 10000, so n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000. Therefore, n must be between 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. But wait, earlier I concluded that n must go up to 3182 because x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001. But if 1/x is 10000, then x=0.0001, which is not included. So, n must satisfy n\u03c0 < 10000, but since n must be integer, n \u2264 floor(10000/\u03c0) = floor(3183.098) = 3183. But x=1/(3183\u03c0) is 0.0001, which is excluded, so n must be less than 3183. So, n \u2264 3182. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. To find the number of such x in (0.0001, 0.001), we solve for n:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001  \n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000  \n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098  \n\nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3182, inclusive. The number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\n\\boxed{2864}"

    "text": ". So, n < approximately 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, the maximum possible n is 3183. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) < n Calculating the left side: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.309. So, n > approximately 318.309. Since n must be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, number of integers = 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Wait, that seems too high. Let me check my calculations again. Wait, 3183 - 319 is 2864, then adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, but let me think again: when n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then minus 19 is 2864. So, 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me think again: does each n correspond to exactly one x in the interval? Yes, because each n gives a distinct x = 1/(n\u03c0), and since n is increasing, x is decreasing. So, each n from 319 to 3183 gives a unique x in the interval. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. Let me double-check:\n\nFirst, x must be greater than 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so n \u2264 3183.\n\nSecond, x must be less than 0.001, so 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309, so n \u2265 319.\n\nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the graph of y = sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely as x approaches 0, but in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), it crosses the x-axis 2865 times.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to n ranging from 319 to 3183. The number of integers in this range is 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"
