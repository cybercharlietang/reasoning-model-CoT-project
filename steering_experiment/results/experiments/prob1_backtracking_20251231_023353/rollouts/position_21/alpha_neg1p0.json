    "text": ". Since n must be an integer, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer value n can take is 3183. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) Calculating the right side: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309. Since n is an integer, the smallest integer value n can take is 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers, inclusive, we subtract the smaller number from the larger one and add 1. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Each of these n corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0) within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, starting from n > 318.309, so n starts at 319. And n < 3183.098, so n goes up to 3183. The number of terms from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2865. That seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I don't think I missed anything here. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0, so between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a small interval near zero, the function will cross the x-axis many times. Each crossing corresponds to a different integer n in this range, so the count is as I found.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) crosses the x-axis whenever 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0, i.e., at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. We need to find all such x in (0.0001, 0.001), which translates to n ranging from 319 to 3183. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

    "text": ". So, n < approximately 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, the maximum possible n is 3183.\n\nNow, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) < n Calculating the left side: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.309. So, n > approximately 318.309. Since n must be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check that. If 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, then n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, meaning the smallest integer n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183, inclusive.\n\nNow, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183, inclusive. The formula for the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the values: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then +1 is 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n, which correspond to 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. So, x is between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), then 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, solving for n:\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001:\n\nn < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n \u2264 3183.\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001:\n\nn > 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n \u2265 319.\n\nSo, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more is 2864. Then add 1, so 2865.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check with specific examples. Let me take n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1004.7) \u2248 0.000995, which is just under 0.001, so it's within the interval. For n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.5) \u2248 0.0000999, which is just above 0.0001, so also within the interval. So, both endpoints are included, so the count is correct.\n\nWait, but I just thought about whether 1/(n\u03c0) is strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. So, does n = 3183 give x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999, which is greater than 0.0001, right? Because 0.0001 is 0.0001, and 0.0000999 is less than that, so it's actually less than 0.0001, which would be outside the interval. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 1/(10000.5) \u2248 0.0000999, which is 0.0000999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's actually below the lower bound. Therefore, n = 3183 would give x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, that means n must be less than or equal to 3183, but when n = 3183, x is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) would be slightly larger than 0.0001.\n\nWait, let me compute 1/(3182\u03c0). 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 3182 * 3 = 9546, 3182 * 0.1416 \u2248 450, so total \u2248 9546 + 450 \u2248 9996. So, 1/9996 \u2248 0.00010004, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. So, n can be up to 3182, because n=3183 gives x \u22480.0000999 <0.0001, which is excluded.\n\nSimilarly, for the lower bound, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248318.309, so n starts at 319.\n\nSo, now, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 +1.\n\nLet me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 is 2864.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought n went up to 3183, but that gives x below 0.0001, so n should go up to 3182. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that calculation. 3182 - 319 +1: 3182 - 300 is 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 -19 = 2863, then +1 is 2864.\n\nSo, that's the correct count.\n\nWait, but let me make sure about the endpoints. So, for n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.000995, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. For n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.00010004, which is just over 0.0001, so included. So, n=319 to n=3182, inclusive. So, the number of terms is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but that was because I included n=3183, which is actually excluded. So, the correct number is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. The number of zeros of sin(1/x) in (a, b) is equal to the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (a, b). So, for a=0.0001 and b=0.001, we have 1/(n\u03c0) > a => n < 1/(a\u03c0) and 1/(n\u03c0) < b => n > 1/(b\u03c0). So, n must be integers strictly between 1/(b\u03c0) and 1/(a\u03c0).\n\nWait, but in my earlier approach, I considered n > 1/(b\u03c0) and n < 1/(a\u03c0), but since n must be an integer, the number of integers is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)).\n\nWait, let me compute 1/(a\u03c0) where a=0.0001: 1/(0.0001 * \u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u22483183.098. So, floor(3183.098) is 3183.\n\nSimilarly, 1/(b\u03c0) where b=0.001: 1/(0.001 * \u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248318.309. So, ceil(318.309) is 319.\n\nSo, the number of integers n is 3183 - 319 +1? Wait, no, the formula is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) +1, but only if the interval is inclusive. But in our case, since the interval is (a, b), which is open, we have to check whether 1/(n\u03c0) is strictly greater than a and strictly less than b.\n\nWait, but in our case, a=0.0001 and b=0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) must be >0.0001 and <0.001. So, n must satisfy n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) =3183.098 and n >1/(0.001\u03c0)=318.309. So, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183, but we have to check if n=3183 gives 1/(n\u03c0) >0.0001.\n\nCompute 1/(3183\u03c0): 3183 * \u03c0 \u22483183 *3.1416\u22483183*3=9549, 3183*0.1416\u2248450, so total\u22489549+450\u224810,000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, but slightly less because 3183\u03c0\u224810,000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, but actually, it's 1/(3183\u03c0)=1/(10,000.5)\u22480.00009999, which is less than 0.0001. So, n=3183 is excluded because x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00009999 <0.0001. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0)=1/(10,000 - something), which is just over 0.0001.\n\nSo, the number of integers is from n=319 to n=3182 inclusive. So, the count is 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method. Let me compute how many zeros are between x=0.0001 and x=0.001 for y=sin(1/x). Each zero occurs at x=1/(n\u03c0), so the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 0.0001 <1/(n\u03c0) <0.001.\n\nSo, solving for n:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) >0.0001 => n <1/(0.0001\u03c0)=10000/\u03c0\u22483183.098\n\n1/(n\u03c0) <0.001 =>n >1/(0.001\u03c0)=1000/\u03c0\u2248318.309\n\nSo, n must be integers from 319 to 3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x\u22480.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nWait, but let me think about it differently. The function sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. The number of oscillations increases as x approaches 0. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is from x=0.0001 to x=0.001, we can estimate how many times the sine function completes a full cycle, and each cycle has two zeros (one positive and one negative), but in our case, we're only counting the zeros, so each cycle contributes one zero? Wait, no, actually, each zero crossing is when sin(\u03b8)=0, which occurs once every \u03c0 interval in \u03b8. Wait, no, sin(\u03b8)=0 at \u03b8=0, \u03c0, 2\u03c0, etc. So, each zero is spaced by \u03c0 in \u03b8. So, in terms of x, since \u03b8=1/x, each zero occurs at x=1/(n\u03c0) for integer n.\n\nSo, the number of zeros is the number of n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) lies in (0.0001, 0.001). So, as we've computed, n ranges from 319 to 3182, giving 2864 zeros.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have a smaller interval, say (0.01, 0.1). Then, 1/(n\u03c0) must be between 0.01 and 0.1. So, n must satisfy 10 < n\u03c0 < 100, so n must be between 10/\u03c0\u22483.18 and 100/\u03c0\u224831.83. So, n from 4 to 31, inclusive. Number of integers is 31 -4 +1=28.\n\nWait, but let me compute 1/(n\u03c0) for n=4: x\u22480.0796, which is less than 0.1, so included. For n=31: x\u22481/(31\u03c0)\u22480.0101, which is just over 0.01, so included. So, the count is 28, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, in our original problem, n ranges from 319 to 3182, inclusive, giving 2864 zeros.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but that was before realizing that n=3183 gives x below 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, the correct count is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0). Let's compute 3182 * \u03c0 \u22483182*3.1416\u22483182*3=9546, 3182*0.1416\u2248450, so total\u22489546+450\u22489996. So, 1/9996\u22480.00010004, which is just over 0.0001, so included. Therefore, n=3182 is included.\n\nSimilarly, n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.000995, which is less than 0.001, so included.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nWait, but let me compute 3182 -319: 3182 -300=2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 -19=2863, then +1=2864.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when we have an open interval (0.0001, 0.001), do we include the endpoints? No, because it's open. So, x must be strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001.\n\nSo, for n=319: x\u22480.000995 <0.001, so included.\n\nFor n=3182: x\u22480.00010004 >0.0001, so included.\n\nBut for n=3183: x\u22480.00009999 <0.0001, so excluded.\n\nSimilarly, for n=318: x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22481/(1000.5)\u22480.0009995, which is less than 0.001, but n=318 is less than 318.309, so n must be \u2265319.\n\nSo, the count remains 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. The function sin(1/x) has a zero at each x=1/(n\u03c0). The number of zeros in (a, b) is the number of integers n such that a <1/(n\u03c0)<b.\n\nSo, solving for n:\n\na <1/(n\u03c0) <b\n\n=> 1/(b\u03c0) <n <1/(a\u03c0)\n\nSo, n must be integers strictly between 1/(b\u03c0) and 1/(a\u03c0).\n\nSo, in our case:\n\n1/(0.001\u03c0)=1000/\u03c0\u2248318.309\n\n1/(0.0001\u03c0)=10000/\u03c0\u22483183.098\n\nSo, n must satisfy 318.309 <n <3183.098\n\nSo, n can be integers from 319 up to 3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00009999 <0.0001, which is excluded. So, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nThus, the number of integers is from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer n. To find the number of such x in (0.0001, 0.001), we solve for n:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001  \n=> 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0  \n\u2248318.309 < n <\u22483183.098\n\nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3182, giving 2864 x-intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2864}$"

    "text": ". So, n < 3183.098. Since n is an integer, the maximum possible n here is 3183. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) Calculating the right side: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.309. So, n > 318.309. Since n is an integer, the smallest possible n here is 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is given by b - a + 1. So, plugging in the values: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Wait, let me double-check that subtraction: 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then minus 19 more is 2864. Yes, so 2864 +1 = 2865. So, that would suggest there are 2865 x-intercepts. But wait, I should make sure that each n in that range indeed gives an x within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Let me check for n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.18) \u2248 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001 but greater than 0.0001, so it's included. For n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) \u2248 0.0001, but since the interval is open at 0.0001, I need to check if 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Let's compute 1/(3183\u03c0): 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since 3183 * \u03c0 is slightly more than 10000, 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001. Therefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, which is the lower bound of the interval. So, n = 3183 gives x = 1/(3183\u03c0) which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included in the interval. Therefore, n should go up to 3182. Let me recalculate n's upper limit. So, x must be greater than 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n\u03c0 < 10000 \u21d2 n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n can be up to 3183, but as we saw, n = 3183 gives x \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, n should be up to 3182. Let's check n = 3182: x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000 - a little bit) \u2248 slightly more than 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Now, let's compute the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Using the formula: 3182 - 319 + 1 = 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, that's 2864 x-intercepts. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but upon correcting the upper limit, it's 2864. Let me confirm with an example. Let's say n starts at 1 and goes to 3. The number of terms is 3 -1 +1 = 3. So, yes, the formula works. So, from 319 to 3182, it's 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. But wait, let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me compute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 is 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 -19 = 2863. Then, 2863 +1 = 2864. Yes, that's correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but let me think again. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. So, between 0.0001 and 0.001, it's oscillating a lot. Each period of sin(1/x) corresponds to a change in x such that 1/x decreases by 2\u03c0. So, the number of zeros should be roughly the number of times 1/x passes through multiples of \u03c0 in the interval. So, from x = 0.001 to x = 0.0001, 1/x goes from 1000 to 10000. So, the number of zeros is the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. So, the smallest n where n\u03c0 \u2265 1000 is n = ceiling(1000/\u03c0) \u2248 ceiling(318.309) = 319. The largest n where n\u03c0 \u2264 10000 is n = floor(10000/\u03c0) \u2248 floor(3183.098) = 3183. So, the number of n's is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Wait, but earlier I thought that n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is excluded. So, perhaps the count should be 3183 - 319 = 2864, but wait, when you subtract 3183 - 319, you get 2864, but since both endpoints are inclusive, you have to add 1. So, 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. But wait, if n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the largest n is 3182, which gives x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.00010003, which is just above 0.0001, so included. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182, inclusive. So, the number of terms is 3182 - 319 +1. Let me compute that again: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, the correct number is 2864. But wait, let's think differently. The interval for 1/x is from 1000 to 10000. The number of zeros is the number of times 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0 in that interval. So, the number of zeros is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceiling(1000/\u03c0) +1. Let's compute that: floor(10000/\u03c0) = floor(3183.098) = 3183. ceiling(1000/\u03c0) = ceiling(318.309) = 319. So, 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. But since x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001 is excluded, we have to subtract 1, giving 2864. So, the total number is 2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nThis implies:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098\n\nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. The number of integers is:\n\n3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}."

Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again. Wait, 3183 - 319 is actually 2864? Let me subtract properly: 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then minus 19 more is 2864. So yes, that's correct. Adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. The x-intercepts are at x = 1/(n\u03c0). The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let's solve for n in both cases.

Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my steps. I started by noting that x = 1/(n\u03c0), and I found the range for n by plugging in the interval limits. So, for x = 0.0001, n is approximately 3183.098, so n must be less than that, meaning the largest integer n is 3183. For x = 0.001, n is approximately 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. So, n runs from 319 to 3183. Now, how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive? The formula is upper - lower + 1, so 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n, which correspond to 2865 x-intercepts in the given interval. That seems correct, but let me think about whether I missed anything. The function sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely as x approaches 0, but in this case, we're looking between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a small interval near zero. Each oscillation corresponds to a zero crossing at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, the number of zeros should indeed be proportional to the reciprocal of the interval length. Wait, let me check if the endpoints are included. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. Therefore, I should check if x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001 and x = 1/(319\u03c0) is less than 0.001. Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0): 1/(3183 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001. So, it's exactly 0.0001 when n = 3183.098, but since n must be an integer, 3183 gives x \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but the interval is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001. Similarly, n = 319 gives x \u2248 0.001, which is the upper bound, but the interval is open, so x must be less than 0.001. Therefore, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded, and x = 1/(319\u03c0) is exactly 0.001, which is also excluded. So, do we include n=3183 and n=319? Wait, no, because x=1/(3183\u03c0) is equal to 0.0001, which is not in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, x=1/(319\u03c0) is equal to 0.001, which is also excluded. So, actually, n should be such that x is strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. So, let's adjust the inequalities accordingly. For x > 0.0001: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. Since n must be less than that, the maximum integer n is 3183, but we have to check if x=1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Let's compute 1/(3183 * \u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/10000 \u2248 0.0001. So, it's exactly 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the largest n such that x > 0.0001 is n=3182, because x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/9999.05 \u2248 0.000100009, which is just above 0.0001. Similarly, for x < 0.001: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u21d2 n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. So, the smallest integer n is 319, and x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.001000..., which is exactly 0.001, excluded. Therefore, the smallest n such that x < 0.001 is n=320, because x=1/(320\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1005.31) \u2248 0.0009947, which is just below 0.001. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me clarify: If n must be greater than 318.309, the smallest integer n is 319. But x=1/(319\u03c0) is approximately 0.001, which is excluded. So, the next n is 320, which gives x=1/(320\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009947, which is less than 0.001. So, n must be from 320 up to 3182, inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 320 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 320 = 2862, then 2862 + 1 = 2863. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2863. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. Hmm, so which one is correct? Let me re-examine the inequalities. The original interval is (0.0001, 0.001). So, x must satisfy 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Substituting x = 1/(n\u03c0), we get:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing all parts by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nCalculating:\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309\n\n10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098\n\nSo, n must be an integer strictly greater than 318.309 and strictly less than 3183.098.\n\nTherefore, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest integer n is 3183.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that x=1/(319\u03c0) is approximately 0.001, which is excluded, so n=319 gives x=0.001, which is not in the interval. Similarly, n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. So, n must be from 320 to 3182, inclusive.\n\nWait, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=319 is the first integer, but x=1/(319\u03c0) is exactly 0.001, which is excluded.

So, which is correct? Let me check again.\n\nThe key point is whether n=319 and n=3183 are included or not.\n\nSince the interval is open, x must be strictly between 0.0001 and 0.001.\n\nSo, x=1/(n\u03c0) must satisfy 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nTherefore, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098.\n\nSo, n can be 319, 320, ..., 3183.\n\nBut wait, n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.001, which is excluded, so n=319 is not allowed.\n\nSimilarly, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded, so n=3183 is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, n must be from 320 to 3182, inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3182 - 320 + 1 = 2863.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that n=319 gives x=0.001, which is excluded, so n starts at 320.\n\nSimilarly, n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so n ends at 3182.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3182 - 320 + 1 = 2863.\n\nBut wait, let me compute 3182 - 320:\n\n3182 - 320 = 2862\n\n2862 +1 = 2863\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nBut earlier, when I first did it without considering the exclusion, I got 2865, which was incorrect because I included n=319 and n=3183, which correspond to x=0.001 and x=0.0001, both excluded.\n\nSo, the correct number is 2863.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check by calculating the exact values.\n\nCompute x when n=319:\n\nx = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(319 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/1002.654 \u2248 0.0009973, which is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nWait, hold on, 0.0009973 is less than 0.001, so x=0.0009973 is within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n=319 gives x\u22480.0009973, which is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nSimilarly, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.000) = 0.0001, which is excluded.\n\nSo, n=319 is allowed because x\u22480.0009973 < 0.001.\n\nSimilarly, n=3183 is excluded because x=0.0001.\n\nSo, n can be from 319 to 3182, inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 +1.\n\nCalculating that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864.\n\nWait, now I'm confused again.\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\nIf n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, but n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so the maximum n is 3182.\n\nSimilarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.0009973, which is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nTherefore, n runs from 319 to 3182, inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 +1.\n\nCalculating:\n\n3182 - 319 = 2863\n\n2863 +1 = 2864\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, so now I'm getting 2864.\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether n=319 is included or not.\n\nLet me compute x=1/(319\u03c0):\n\n1/(319 * \u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.654) \u2248 0.0009973, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nSimilarly, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded.\n\nSo, n=319 is allowed, n=3183 is not.\n\nTherefore, n runs from 319 to 3182, inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n=319 gives x=0.001, but actually, it's approximately 0.0009973, which is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nSimilarly, n=320 gives x\u22480.0009947, which is also included.\n\nWait, but n=319 gives x\u22480.0009973, which is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nTherefore, n starts at 319 and ends at 3182.\n\nSo, number of terms is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach.\n\nThe number of zeros of sin(1/x) in (a, b) is equal to the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (a, b).\n\nSo, we have:\n\na < 1/(n\u03c0) < b\n\nWhich implies:\n\n1/b < n\u03c0 < 1/a\n\nDividing by \u03c0:\n\n1/(b\u03c0) < n < 1/(a\u03c0)\n\nSo, n must be integers strictly between 1/(b\u03c0) and 1/(a\u03c0).\n\nIn our case, a=0.0001, b=0.001.\n\nSo,\n\n1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0)\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098\n\nSo, n must be integers from 319 to 3183, inclusive.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so n must be up to 3182.\n\nBut according to this inequality, n can be up to 3183, but x=1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001, which is excluded.\n\nSo, n must be less than 3183.098, so n=3183 is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, n runs from 319 to 3182, inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but let me compute 3182 - 319:\n\n3182 - 319 = 2863\n\n2863 +1 = 2864.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 2863 because I thought n=319 was excluded, but actually, n=319 is included because x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009973 <0.001.\n\nSo, n=319 is allowed, n=3183 is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, the correct number is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method.\n\nThe number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1/(0.001) < n\u03c0 < 1/(0.0001)\n\nWhich is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDivide by \u03c0: 318.309 < n < 3183.098\n\nSo, n can be from 319 to 3183, but n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so n=3183 is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, n runs from 319 to 3182, inclusive.\n\nNumber of terms: 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 2864.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought it was 2863, but now I'm getting 2864.\n\nLet me check with a small example.\n\nSuppose I have n from a to b, inclusive, where a=3 and b=5.\n\nNumber of terms: 5-3+1=3.\n\nSimilarly, if a=319 and b=3182, number of terms=3182-319+1=2864.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n.

    "text": ". So, n < 3183.098. Since n is an integer, the maximum possible n is 3183. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) Calculating the right side: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.309. So, n > 318.309. Since n is an integer, the minimum possible n is 319. Now, n must be an integer between 319 and 3183, inclusive. To find the number of integers in this range, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems like a lot of intercepts. Let me check if I did the calculations correctly. First, 1/(0.0001\u03c0) is indeed 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n must be less than that, so n can be up to 3183. Similarly, 1/(0.001\u03c0) is 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n must be greater than that, so starting at 319. So the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2865. So, that seems correct. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Hmm, but I should make sure that each of these n values corresponds to an x within the interval. Let me test with n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.87) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001 and greater than 0.0001. Similarly, n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) = 0.0001, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so n must be less than 3183.098, so n = 3183 gives x \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but since it's open, we exclude it. Wait, so maybe n should be less than 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so actually, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but when n=3183, x is less than 0.0001, which is outside the interval. So, actually, we need to find n such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the maximum n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3183, but since x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, the actual maximum n that satisfies x > 0.0001 is n=3183 -1 = 3182? Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. We have x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, so n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n can be up to 3183, but n must be an integer, so n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3183 -1 = 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010003, which is just above 0.0001. So, n can be from 319 up to 3182. Therefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 gives 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, so I think I made a mistake earlier by including n=3183, which gives x less than 0.0001, which is not in the interval. So, the correct number should be 2864. Let me double-check: n starts at 319, ends at 3182. So, the count is 3182 - 319 +1. 3182 - 319 is 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, 2864 x-intercepts. Alternatively, I can think of it as the number of integers between 319 and 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864. So, that should be the correct answer. I think that's it.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need to find the number of such x in (0.0001, 0.001). \n\n1.

Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) < n Calculating the left side: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309. Since n is an integer, n \u2265 319. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers in this range, I subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add one (since both endpoints are included). So, number of x-intercepts = 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, setting sin(1/x) = 0 leads to 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). That's correct. Then, substituting x into the interval: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n, I correctly inverted the inequalities because when you take reciprocals, the direction reverses. So, n must be between 1000/(\u03c0) and 10000/(\u03c0), which is approximately 318.309 to 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me think if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, I can consider how many times the sine function oscillates as x approaches zero. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly as x approaches zero. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is quite close to zero, the function will oscillate a large number of times, each oscillation corresponding to a peak and a trough, which means two intercepts per period. Wait, but actually, each period of sin(1/x) corresponds to an increase of 2\u03c0 in the argument, so each period would be when 1/x increases by 2\u03c0, which is when x decreases by 1/(2\u03c0). So, the number of periods in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is the number of times 1/x increases by 2\u03c0 as x goes from 0.001 to 0.0001. Let me compute that. The change in 1/x from x=0.001 to x=0.0001 is from 1000 to 10000. So, the total change is 10000 - 1000 = 9000. Each period is 2\u03c0, so the number of periods is 9000 / (2\u03c0) \u2248 9000 / 6.283 \u2248 1432.39. Since each period has two x-intercepts (one at the start and one at the end, but actually, the zero crossings are at each multiple of \u03c0, so perhaps each \u03c0 interval corresponds to one zero crossing). Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify. The function sin(\u03b8) crosses zero at \u03b8 = n\u03c0 for each integer n. So, for each increment of \u03c0 in \u03b8, we have a zero crossing. So, in terms of x, each zero crossing occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001, \u03b8 = 1/x increases from 1000 to 10000. So, the number of zero crossings is the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. So, the smallest n such that n\u03c0 \u2265 1000 is n = ceil(1000/\u03c0) \u2248 ceil(318.309) = 319. The largest n such that n\u03c0 \u2264 10000 is n = floor(10000/\u03c0) \u2248 floor(3183.098) = 3183. So, the number of zero crossings is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.

So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309 and less than approximately 3183.098. But n has to be an integer, so n starts from the next integer after 318.309, which is 319, and goes up to the integer just below 3183.098, which is 3183. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, we can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, and 2864 + 1 = 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 integer values of n, each corresponding to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0) within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations because 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct. But just to make sure, let's consider n starting at 319 and ending at 3183. The count is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then minus 19 is 2864. So, yes, adding 1 gives 2865. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that makes sense because as x approaches zero, 1/x becomes very large, and the sine function oscillates more and more rapidly. So, between 0.0001 and 0.001, which are both close to zero, the function sin(1/x) will oscillate a huge number of times, each oscillation crossing the x-axis twice (once going up, once going down), but since we're only counting the points where it crosses zero, each zero crossing corresponds to an integer multiple of \u03c0 in the argument. So, each n gives a unique zero crossing, and since n ranges from 319 to 3183, that's 2865 zeros.

Similarly, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) Calculating the right side: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.309. So, n > 318.309. Since n must be an integer, n must be greater than 318.309, which means n starts at 319. And n must be less than 3183.098, so the largest integer n is 3183. Now, I need to find all integers n such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. To find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, no, actually, if I have numbers from a to b inclusive, the count is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The interval is from x = 0.0001 to x = 0.001. Each x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, the smallest n is when x is largest (0.001), so n \u2248 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n starts at 319. The largest n is when x is smallest (0.0001), so n \u2248 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n goes up to 3183. The number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.

So, number of x-intercepts = 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Wait, let me check that calculation again. 3183 minus 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more gives 2864.

So, n > approximately 318.309. Since n is an integer, the minimum possible n here is 319. Now, n must be an integer greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. Let me check: for n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.55) \u2248 0.000997, which is just above 0.0001 and less than 0.001. Wait, no, 0.000997 is actually 0.000997, which is 0.000997, which is 0.000997. Wait, 0.0001 is 0.0001, and 0.001 is 0.001. So, 0.000997 is 0.000997, which is between 0.0001 and 0.001. Similarly, for n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) \u2248 0.0001, but since n must be less than 3183.098, the maximum integer n is 3183, which gives x \u2248 0.0001. But since the interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), we don't include the endpoints. So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, n must be such that x=1/(n\u03c0) is strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. So, let's re-express the inequalities without approximating yet. From 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, we have n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0. Similarly, from 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, we have n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0. So, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Since n is an integer, the number of integers between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0 is the floor of (10000/\u03c0) minus the ceiling of (1000/\u03c0). Let me compute these values more precisely. 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so the ceiling of that is 319. 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so the floor of that is 3183. Therefore, the number of integers n is 3183 - 319 + 1. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183, so the count is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 318 = 2865? Wait, 3183 - 319 is 2864, so 2864 +1 is 2865. Hmm, that seems a bit high. Let me check with approximate values. 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so the largest integer n is 3183. 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 +1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 is 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Each such n corresponds to an x-intercept at x=1/(n\u03c0) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me double-check this because sometimes when dealing with inequalities, especially with reciprocals, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me consider the function sin(1/x) between x=0.0001 and x=0.001. As x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000. So, sin(1/x) is sin(t) where t goes from 1000 to 10000 radians. Now, each time t increases by \u03c0, sin(t) crosses zero. So, the number of zeros is roughly the number of times t crosses a multiple of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. The number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Wait, that's similar to what I did before. So, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Which is exactly the same as before. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, which gives 2865 integers. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let me check for n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.55) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001 and greater than 0.0001. Similarly, for n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, but since it's an open interval, we don't include x=0.0001, so n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001, which is not included. Wait, but earlier I thought n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001, but 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) exactly? Wait, 3183*\u03c0 \u2248 3183*3.14159265 \u2248 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, x=0.0001 is excluded. So, n=3183 would give x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded. So, the maximum n is 3182. Wait, that's a mistake. Let me recast this. The condition is x > 0.0001 and x < 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, for 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, n < 10000/\u03c0 \u22483183.098. So, n can be up to 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) \u22480.0001, which is not included in the open interval. So, actually, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000 - \u03c0) \u2248 slightly more than 0.0001. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 3183\u03c0 \u224810000, so 3182\u03c0 \u224810000 - \u03c0 \u224810000 -3.1416\u22489996.8584. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u22481/9996.8584\u22480.00010003, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but 0.00010003 is greater than 0.0001, so it is included. So, n=3182 gives x\u22480.00010003, which is in the interval. Similarly, n=3183 gives x\u22480.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, the maximum n is 3182. Similarly, the minimum n is 319, as before. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 +1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 is 2864. So, 2864 integers. Wait, that's different from the previous count. So, where did I go wrong earlier? I think the confusion comes from whether n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) which is approximately 0.0001, which is the lower bound of the interval, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so n=3183 is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. So, the number of integers is from 319 to 3182, which is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864. Wait, but let's check: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, 2864 x-intercepts. But earlier, I thought it was 2865. So, which is correct? Let me think again. The condition is 0.0001 < x < 0.001. So, x=1/(n\u03c0) must satisfy 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, solving for n: 1/(0.001) > n\u03c0 > 1/(0.0001). So, 1000 > n\u03c0 > 10000. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, if x=1/(n\u03c0), then x < 0.001 implies 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, so n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248318.309. Similarly, x >0.0001 implies 1/(n\u03c0) >0.0001, so n < 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.098. So, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098. So, n can be from 319 to 3183, inclusive. But wait, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is excluded because the interval is open. Therefore, n can only go up to 3182. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182, inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 +1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, which is correct? Let me test with smaller numbers to see how the counting works. Suppose I have an interval (a, b), and I want to count integers n where a < n < b. For example, if a=2.3 and b=5.8, the integers n are 3,4,5, so 3 numbers. So, 5 -3 +1=3. Similarly, in our case, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. But since x=1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, which is excluded, we must end at n=3182. So, n=319 to n=3182. Therefore, the count is 3182 -319 +1=2864. So, the correct number is 2864. But wait, let me check with n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22481/(10000 - \u03c0)\u22481/9996.858\u22480.00010003, which is greater than 0.0001, so included. Similarly, n=3183 gives x\u22480.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. So, the number of integers is 3182 -319 +1=2864. So, the answer should be 2864. But earlier, I thought it was 2865. So, which is correct? Let me think again. The number of integers between a and b inclusive is b -a +1. So, from 319 to 3182, the number is 3182 -319 +1=2864. Therefore, the correct number is 2864. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by including n=3183, which actually gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the correct number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but let me make sure. Let me compute 1/(3182\u03c0). Let's calculate 3182 * \u03c0. \u03c0\u22483.14159265. So, 3182 * 3.14159265. Let's compute 3000\u03c0=9424.77796. 182\u03c0\u2248572.019. So, total is approximately 9424.77796 +572.019\u22489996.797. So, 1/9996.797\u22480.00010003, which is just over 0.0001, so included. Similarly, 3183\u03c0\u22483182\u03c0 + \u03c0\u22489996.797 +3.1416\u224810000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0)=1/10000=0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, n=3183 is excluded, so the maximum n is 3182. Therefore, the number of integers is 3182 -319 +1=2864. So, the answer is 2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0).

    "text": ". So, n < 3183.098. Since n is an integer, the maximum n can be is 3183. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) Calculating the right side: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.309. So, n > 318.309. Since n is an integer, the minimum n can be is 319. Therefore, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. Alternatively, I can think of it as the number of integers from 1 to 3183 minus the number from 1 to 318. So, 3183 - 318 = 2865. Yeah, that seems consistent. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Each of these n values corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2865. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. Let me test with n = 318: x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.5) \u2248 0.0009995, which is less than 0.001. Hmm, but 0.0009995 is approximately 0.001, but it's slightly less. Wait, no, 0.0009995 is actually 0.0009995, which is 0.0009995, which is less than 0.001, so that's correct. But wait, n=318 gives x \u2248 0.0009995, which is just below 0.001. So, n=318 would give x just below 0.001, which is still in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But earlier, I set n > 318.309, so n starts at 319. Wait, but if n=318 gives x \u2248 0.0009995, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the lower bound. Let me re-examine the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. But wait, if n=318, then 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009995, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, perhaps I should include n=318 as well. Wait, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is less than that, so it's not included. Wait, no, 318 is less than 318.309, so n must be greater than 318.309, so n=319 is the first integer. So, n=318 gives x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.0009995, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Wait, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=319 is the first integer. So, n=318 is not included because 318 < 318.309, so it's not in the solution set. Therefore, n starts at 319. Similarly, for the upper bound, n must be less than 3183.098, so n=3183 is included because 3183 < 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 = 2865. So, 2865 x-intercepts. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me check with specific values. Let's take n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22481/(1003.05)\u22480.0009969, which is less than 0.001 and greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Similarly, n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22481/(10000.0)\u22480.0001, but wait, 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22481/(10000)\u22480.0001. But the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001. So, x=0.0001 is excluded. So, does n=3183 give x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001? Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0 \u22483183 *3.1416\u22483183*3=9549, 3183*0.1416\u2248450, so total\u22489549+450\u22489999, so 1/9999\u22480.00010001, which is just above 0.0001. So, x\u22480.00010001, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. Therefore, n=3183 is included. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 2865 x-intercepts. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), we find the range of n by solving 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, leading to n between 319 and 3183. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

Let me compute that: 3183 - 318 = 2865, then 2865 + 1 = 2866. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. If n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Because when counting inclusive, it's (last - first) + 1. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, okay, so I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. So, number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319 first. 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, add 1: 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n where x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me check the calculations again. So, 1/(n\u03c0) must be between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, n must be between 1/(0.001\u03c0) and 1/(0.0001\u03c0). Let me compute those again. 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. And 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098. Since n is an integer, the smallest n is 319, and the largest n is 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319. 3183 - 300 = 2883, then 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, yes, that's correct.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when dealing with inequalities, especially with reciprocals, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me verify the steps again. First, I set x = 1/(n\u03c0), so substituting into the interval 0.0001 < x < 0.001 gives 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.

Dividing each part by \u03c0, we get 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098.

Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, I should make sure that each n in that range gives a unique x in the interval.

So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309. Since n is an integer, n starts from 319. Therefore, n ranges from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of integers is 3183 - 318 = 2865, but wait, that's not right. Let me check again. Wait, the starting point is 319, so if I subtract 318 from 3183, I get 3183 - 318 = 2865, but since the first term is 319, which is 318 + 1, maybe I should think of it as (3183 - 319) + 1. Let me calculate that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake with the inequalities. Let me verify the values for n when x is at the endpoints. For x = 0.001, which is the upper limit, x = 1/(n\u03c0) implies n = 1/(x\u03c0) = 1/(0.001 * \u03c0) \u2248 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. For x = 0.0001, which is the lower limit, x = 1/(n\u03c0) implies n = 1/(0.0001 * \u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so the largest integer n is 3183. So, n runs from 319 to 3183. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Yep, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). For x in (0.0001, 0.001), we find n ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 intercepts.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

So, n > 318.309. Since n must be an integer, n \u2265 319.\n\nSo, n must be an integer between 319 and 3183, inclusive. To find the number of integers in this range, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add one (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, let me confirm the substitution. x = 1/(n\u03c0), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. That leads to 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0). Calculating 1/(0.001\u03c0) is 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n must be greater than that, so the smallest integer n is 319. Similarly, 1/(0.0001\u03c0) is 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n must be less than that, so the largest integer n is 3183. Therefore, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2865. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I have an interval (a, b), and I'm looking for points where x = 1/(n\u03c0), do I include both endpoints? Since the interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. Therefore, I need to make sure that 1/(n\u03c0) is strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. So, when I found n > 318.309, n must be at least 319, and n < 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183. Therefore, the integers n start at 319 and go up to 3183. So, the count is 3183 - 319 + 1, which is 2865. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the number of integers between a and b is floor(b) - ceil(a) + 1, where a = 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309 and b = 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, ceil(a) is 319, floor(b) is 3183, so 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that's the same result.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n.

Since n must be an integer, the maximum possible n is 3183.\n\nNow, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) < n Calculating the left side: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.309. So, n > approximately 318.309. Since n must be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319.\n\nWait, hold on, let me check that. If n > 318.309, then the smallest integer n is 319. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. Now, to find how many integers are in this range, we can subtract 318 from 3183, but let's make sure. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. But here, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, and 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations. Sometimes when dealing with inequalities, especially with reciprocals, it's easy to flip the inequality signs or make a mistake in the algebra. Let me go through it again.\n\nWe have x = 1/(n\u03c0). The interval is 0.0001 < x < 0.001. So, substituting, we get:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nTaking reciprocals (and remembering that taking reciprocals reverses the inequality signs because all terms are positive):\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing all parts by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nCalculating:\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309\n\n10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098\n\nSo, n must be greater than approximately 318.309 and less than approximately 3183.098.\n\nSince n must be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319, and the largest is 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\n2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the given interval.\n\nWait, but let me think again about whether each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0) is a strictly decreasing function of n, each n gives a unique x in the interval. So, each n from 319 to 3183 will give a distinct x-intercept in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the count should be correct.\n\nI also want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of integers between 319 and 3183. Let me compute 3183 - 319 = 2864, but since both ends are inclusive, we add 1, making it 2865. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, another way to compute the number of integers from a to b inclusive is floor(b) - ceil(a) + 1. Here, a is approximately 318.309, so ceil(a) is 319. b is approximately 3183.098, so floor(b) is 3183. Then, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct number of x-intercepts. Therefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\). This occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for some integer \\( n \\), which implies \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n\nWe need to find the range of \\( n \\) such that \\( x \\) lies in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\). This translates to the inequalities:\n\\[ 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\]\n\nTaking reciprocals and solving for \\( n \\):\n\\[ 1000 < n\\pi < 10000 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{1000}{\\pi} < n < \\frac{10000}{\\pi} \\]\n\nCalculating the bounds:\n\\[ \\frac{1000}{\\pi} \\approx 318.309 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{10000}{\\pi} \\approx 3183.098 \\]\n\nThus, \\( n \\) must be an integer between 319 and 3183 inclusive. The number of integers in this range is:\n\\[ 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is \\(\\boxed{2865}\\)."

    "text": ". So, n < 3183.098. Since n has to be an integer, the maximum possible n is 3183. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) Calculating the right side: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.309. So, n > 318.309. Since n is an integer, the smallest possible n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, to find how many integers are in this range, I subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, let me double-check my calculations. When I calculated 1/(0.0001\u03c0), I got approximately 3183.098, which makes sense because 0.0001 is 10^-4, so 1/0.0001 is 10,000, and dividing by \u03c0 gives around 3183. Similarly, 1/(0.001\u03c0) is 1000/\u03c0, which is about 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. Then, the largest n is 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of x-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we analyze where the function equals zero.

So, n > approximately 318.309. Since n must be an integer, n \u2265 319.\n\nSo, n must be an integer such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is given by b - a + 1. So, here, it's 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's calculate that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n in that range, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, starting with x between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is 10^(-4) and 10^(-3). So, 1/x would be between 1000 and 10000. So, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. Since sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, then n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000. So, n must be between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute those values again: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct.\n\nI think that's the right approach. Each integer n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept in the given interval, so the total number is 2865. I don't think I missed anything here. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more frequently as x approaches 0, so between 0.0001 and 0.001, it's oscillating quite a bit, but the exact count is given by the number of zeros of sin(1/x) in that interval, which we've calculated as 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) crosses the x-axis whenever 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0, leading to x = 1/(n\u03c0). Within the interval (0.0001, 0.001), 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. Thus, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which evaluates to approximately 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. The number of integers in this range is 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"
