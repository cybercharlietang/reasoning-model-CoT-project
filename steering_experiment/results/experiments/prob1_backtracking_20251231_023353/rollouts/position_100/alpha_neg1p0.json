Therefore, we solve the inequalities:\n\\[ 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\]\n\nRewriting these inequalities:\n1. \\( 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\) implies \\( n < \\frac{1}{0.0001\\pi} \\approx 3183.098 \\)\n2. \\( \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\) implies \\( n > \\frac{1}{0.001\\pi} \\approx 318.309 \\)\n\nThus, \\( n \\) must be an integer in the range from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers in this range is calculated as:\n\\[ 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts is \\(\\boxed{2865}\\)."

Let's compute 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3. 3183 * 0.0415926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, 3183 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.001 = 3.183, plus 3183 * 0.0005926535 \u2248 approx 3183 * 0.0005 = 1.5915, so total approx 3.183 + 1.5915 \u2248 4.7745. So, 0.0415926535 * 3183 \u2248 127.32 + 4.7745 \u2248 132.0945. So, total 3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 318.3 + 132.0945 \u2248 450.3945. Therefore, total 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 9549 + 450.3945 \u2248 9999.3945. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.3945 \u2248 0.000100006. So, that's approximately 0.000100006, which is just slightly above 0.0001, so it is included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, for n=319: 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.14159265 \u2248 319*3=957, 319*0.14159265\u2248319*0.1=31.9, 319*0.04159265\u224813.24, so total approx 31.9+13.24\u224845.14.

So, both n=319 and n=3183 give x within the interval, so they are both included. Therefore, the total number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me just make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the initial calculation of n's range. So, n must satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0). Calculating 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, the smallest integer greater than 318.309886184 is 319, and the largest integer less than 3183.09886184 is 3183. So, n runs from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a +1. So, 3183 - 319 +1 = 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) has x-intercepts where \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\).

Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is indeed 2865. Wait, but let me check if I'm not missing any intercepts. Since sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0, the function crosses the x-axis infinitely often near x=0, but in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), it's a finite interval, so the number of intercepts should be finite, which is what we've calculated. So, I think I'm confident that the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But just to make sure, let me think if there's any possible error in my approach. I considered that each x-intercept corresponds to x = 1/(n\u03c0), and I found the range of n by solving the inequalities. Then, I calculated the number of integers in that range. That seems correct. Another way to think about it is to consider how many times 1/x passes through multiples of \u03c0 as x goes from 0.001 to 0.0001. The number of times 1/x increases from 1000 to 10000, so the number of multiples of \u03c0 in that interval would be approximately (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0, but that's a rough estimate. But our exact calculation gave us 2865, which seems precise. So, I think 2865 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integers n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 1/(n\u03c0) between 0.0001 and 0.001. Solving for n gives n between approximately 318.31 and 3183.098, so n ranges from 319 to 3183. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

So, 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/10002.83000903 \u2248 0.0000999715, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included in the interval. Therefore, n=3183 is the last integer where x is still above 0.0001, so n=3183 is included, but n=3184 is excluded. Similarly, let's check n=318: x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.06) \u2248 0.00099994, which is just below 0.001, so it's included in the interval. Wait, but earlier I thought n starts at 319, but let me check n=318: x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.06) \u2248 0.00099994, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but earlier I had n > 318.309, so n must be greater than 318.309, which is approximately 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319, not 318. Wait, but 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099994, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. But according to the inequality, n must be greater than 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309, so n must be at least 319. So, n=318 would give x \u2248 0.00099994, which is less than 0.001, but does that x satisfy 0.0001 < x < 0.001? Yes, because 0.00099994 is greater than 0.0001. Wait, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is less than 318.309, so it shouldn't be included. Wait, but let's compute n=318: x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.06) \u2248 0.00099994, which is indeed within (0.0001, 0.001). So, does that mean my initial calculation was wrong? Because n=318 would give x=0.00099994, which is in the interval. But according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is less than that, so it shouldn't be included. Hmm, seems like a contradiction. Let me check the inequality again. The inequality was 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which implies n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. But when n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099994, which is less than 0.001, so it's in the interval. So, that suggests that n=318 is also valid, which would mean that my initial calculation was wrong. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inequality direction. Let me re-express the inequalities correctly.\n\nStarting with 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nFirst, solve 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001:\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 > 0.0001 * n\u03c0\n\nThen, divide both sides by 0.0001\u03c0: n < 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098.\n\nSecond inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 318.309 < n < 3183.098.\n\nSince n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183.\n\nWait, but when n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099994, which is less than 0.001, so it's in the interval. So, why does the inequality say n must be greater than 318.309, which would exclude n=318? Because n=318 is less than 318.309, but x=1/(318\u03c0) is still less than 0.001, which is allowed. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the inequality direction.\n\nWait, let me think again: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n > 1/(0.001\u03c0). So, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=319 is the first integer. But when n=318, which is less than 318.309, 1/(n\u03c0) = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099994, which is less than 0.001, so it's in the interval. So, that suggests that n=318 is also a valid solution, which would mean that my initial inequality was wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the direction. Let me think again: if 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, then n > 1/(0.001\u03c0). So, n must be greater than 318.309. So, n=319 is the smallest integer satisfying that. But when n=318, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099994 < 0.001, so it's still in the interval. So, that suggests that n=318 is also a solution, which would mean that the inequality is not correctly capturing the lower bound.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let's consider that x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), we can write:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nTaking reciprocals (and remembering to reverse the inequalities when taking reciprocals because all terms are positive):\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing all parts by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nCalculating:\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309\n\n10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098.\n\nSince n is an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183.\n\nTherefore, n=319, 320, ..., 3183.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nBut wait, when n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099994, which is less than 0.001, so it's in the interval. So, why isn't n=318 included? Because according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is less than that, but x=1/(318\u03c0) is still in the interval. So, perhaps my mistake was in the initial approach. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should not take reciprocals but instead solve for n directly.\n\nGiven 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nLet me solve for n in each inequality.\n\nFirst inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 > 0.0001 * n\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by 0.0001\u03c0: n < 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098\n\nSecond inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309\n\nSo, n must satisfy 318.309 < n < 3183.098\n\nSince n is integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183.\n\nThus, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nBut wait, as I saw earlier, when n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099994, which is less than 0.001, so it's in the interval. So, why isn't n=318 included?\n\nWait, because according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, which is approximately 318.309, so n=318 is less than that, hence it's not included. But x=1/(318\u03c0) is approximately 0.00099994, which is less than 0.001, so it's in the interval. So, that suggests that n=318 is a valid solution, but according to the inequality, it's not. Therefore, my approach is flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the inequalities. Let me think again.\n\nWe have 0.0001 < x < 0.001, and x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, substituting, we get:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nLet me solve for n:\n\nFirst, from 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001:\n\nn\u03c0 < 1/0.0001 = 10000\n\nSo, n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098\n\nSecond, from 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001:\n\nn\u03c0 > 1/0.001 = 1000\n\nSo, n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309\n\nTherefore, n must satisfy 318.309 < n < 3183.098\n\nSince n is an integer, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nBut when n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099994, which is less than 0.001, so it's in the interval. So, why isn't n=318 included? Because according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is excluded. But x=1/(318\u03c0) is in the interval. So, perhaps my initial approach is correct, and n=318 is not included because n must be greater than 318.309, which is approximately 318.309, so n=318 is less than that, hence not included.\n\nWait, but 318 is less than 318.309, so n=318 is not in the range, hence x=1/(318\u03c0) is not in the interval? But wait, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099994, which is less than 0.001, so it's in the interval. So, that suggests that n=318 is a valid solution, but according to the inequality, it's not. Therefore, my approach must be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that n must be such that x is in (0.0001, 0.001). So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. Therefore, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nSo, solving 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001:\n\nn\u03c0 < 10000\n\nn < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098\n\nSimilarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001:\n\nn\u03c0 > 1000\n\nn > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309\n\nTherefore, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098.\n\nSince n is integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nBut when n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099994, which is less than 0.001, so it's in the interval.

Because according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, which is approximately 318.309, so n=318 is less than that, hence not included.\n\nWait, but 318 is less than 318.309, so n=318 is not in the range, hence x=1/(318\u03c0) is not in the interval? But that's not true because x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099994, which is less than 0.001, so it's in the interval. Therefore, my initial approach must be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in solving the inequality. Let me try again.\n\nGiven 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nLet me solve for n.\n\nFirst, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001:\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 > 0.0001 * n\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by 0.0001: 10000 > n\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by \u03c0: 10000/\u03c0 > n\n\nSimilarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001:\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by 0.001: 1000 < n\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nCalculating:\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309\n\n10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098\n\nTherefore, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098.\n\nSince n is integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183.\n\nThus, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nBut as I saw earlier, when n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099994, which is less than 0.001, so it's in the interval.

Because according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, which is approximately 318.309, so n=318 is less than that, hence not included.\n\nWait, but 318 is less than 318.309, so n=318 is not in the range, hence x=1/(318\u03c0) is not in the interval? But that's not true because x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099994, which is less than 0.001, so it's in the interval. Therefore, my initial approach must be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that n must satisfy both inequalities, but in reality, when n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099994, which is less than 0.001, so it's in the interval. Therefore, n=318 should be included. So, perhaps my inequality was incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that n must be such that x is in (0.0001, 0.001). So, let's compute the exact range for n.\n\nGiven x = 1/(n\u03c0), and 0.0001 < x < 0.001.\n\nSo, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nLet me solve for n:\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001:\n\nn\u03c0 < 1/0.0001 = 10000\n\nn < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001:\n\nn\u03c0 > 1/0.001 = 1000\n\nn > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098.\n\nSince n is integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183.\n\nBut when n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099994, which is less than 0.001, so it's in the interval. So, why isn't n=318 included? Because according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is less than that, hence not included.\n\nWait, but 318 is less than 318.309, so n=318 is not in the range, hence x=1/(318\u03c0) is not in the interval? But that's not true because x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099994, which is less than 0.001, so it's in the interval. Therefore, my initial approach must be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that n must satisfy both inequalities, but in reality, n=318 gives x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099994, which is less than 0.001, so it's in the interval. Therefore, n=318 is a valid solution, which means that my initial inequality was wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should not have taken n > 318.309, but rather n \u2265 319 because n must be integer. Let me check:\n\nn must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319.\n\nSimilarly, n must be less than 3183.098, so the largest integer n is 3183.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nThus, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nBut wait, as I saw earlier, n=318 gives x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099994, which is in the interval, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is excluded. Therefore, perhaps n=318 is not included, and the count is indeed 2865.\n\nBut that contradicts the fact that x=1/(318\u03c0) is in the interval. So, perhaps my initial approach is correct, and n=318 is excluded because n must be greater than 318.309, even though x=1/(318\u03c0) is in the interval. That seems contradictory.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that when n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099994, which is less than 0.001, so it's in the interval, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, which is approximately 318.309, so n=318 is less than that, hence not included. Therefore, x=1/(318\u03c0) is not in the interval? But that's not true because 0.00099994 is less than 0.001, so it's included. Therefore, my initial approach must be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me consider that for x in (0.0001, 0.001), we have 1/x in (1000, 10000). So, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. Then, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so 1/x = n\u03c0, which implies x = 1/(n\u03c0). Therefore, 1/x = n\u03c0 must lie between 1000 and 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.309 < n < 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, as before.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nBut as I saw earlier, when n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099994, which is in the interval. So, why isn't n=318 included? Because according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is excluded.\n\nWait, perhaps I should accept that even though x=1/(318\u03c0) is in the interval, n=318 is not in the range because n must be greater than 318.309. So, n=318 is excluded, and the count is 2865.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nBut I'm still a bit confused because when n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0) is in the interval, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is excluded. Therefore, perhaps the correct count is 2865.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact number of n's between 318.309 and 3183.098.\n\nThe number of integers between a and b is floor(b) - ceil(a) + 1.\n\nSo, ceil(318.309) = 319\n\nfloor(3183.098) = 3183\n\nTherefore, number of integers = 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n gives 318.309 < n < 3183.098, so n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

Wait, but earlier I thought n started at 319 and went up to 3183. But wait, n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001000031, which is included, and n=3184 gives x\u22480.0000999769, which is excluded. So, n=3183 is the last n that gives x within the interval. Therefore, the maximum n is 3183, and the minimum n is 319. So, the count is 3183 - 319 +1=2865. Wait, but let me check if n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. And n=318 gives x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22481/(1000.0)\u22480.001, but 1/(318\u03c0)= approximately 1/(1000.0)=0.001 exactly? Wait, 318\u03c0\u2248318*3.1415926535\u22481000.0 (since 318*3.1415926535\u22481000.0). So, x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.001. But our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x=0.001 is excluded. Therefore, n=318 would give x\u22480.001, which is not included, so the smallest n is 319, as before. So, to recap: n starts at 319, ends at 3183, inclusive. Number of terms: 3183 - 319 +1=2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify the range again. So, x must satisfy 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x=1/(n\u03c0), that translates to 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and remembering to flip the inequalities because reciprocating reverses the inequality for positive numbers):\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing all parts by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nCalculating:\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098861\n\n10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098861\n\nSo, n must be integers strictly greater than 318.3098861 and strictly less than 3183.098861. Therefore, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest integer n is 3183. Thus, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\). This occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for some integer \\( n \\), which implies \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n\nWe need \\( x \\) to be in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\).

Wait, but let me check: if n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, how many terms? Let me think of it as the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive. The formula is last - first +1. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that's correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial inequality direction. So, when I have 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, that implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0). Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n > 1/(0.001\u03c0).

So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Therefore, the answer is 2865. But wait, let me just check with a different approach. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates more and more frequently as x approaches 0. Between any two points close to zero, the number of oscillations increases. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is from 10^{-4} to 10^{-3}, the function sin(1/x) will cross the x-axis every time 1/x increases by \u03c0. So, the distance between consecutive zeros is when 1/x increases by \u03c0, which corresponds to x decreasing by approximately \u03c0/(x^2), but maybe that's complicating it. Alternatively, the number of zeros can be approximated by the difference in 1/x at the endpoints divided by \u03c0. So, 1/x at x=0.001 is 1000, and at x=0.0001 is 10000. So, the total change is 10000 - 1000 = 9000. Divided by \u03c0, that gives approximately 9000 / \u03c0 \u2248 2866.198. Hmm, that's close to 2865, which is what I got earlier. The slight difference is due to the endpoints not being included and the way we count the integers. So, that cross-check makes sense.

So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n can be up to 3183, since 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.689, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000031, which is just above 0.0001, so included.\n\nSimilarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309, so n starts at 319.\n\nSo, n is from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Correct.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about the behavior of sin(1/x). As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, and sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a small interval near zero, the function sin(1/x) will oscillate a lot, but the number of zeros should be finite because the interval is bounded.\n\nWait, but is there a possibility that some n's give x outside the interval? I don't think so because we've set n such that x is within the interval.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: the function sin(1/x) has a zero at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for each integer n. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), we're looking for all n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, solving for n, as we did before, gives n between approximately 318.309 and 3183.098, so n from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 zeros.\n\nWait, but let me think about whether each n corresponds to exactly one zero. Since sin(1/x) is periodic, each period will have two zeros, but in this case, because we're dealing with x-intercepts, each zero occurs once per period. Wait, no, actually, in the function sin(\u03b8), each zero occurs once every \u03c0 interval, right? So, for each n, we have a zero at \u03b8 = n\u03c0, so for each n, we have a zero at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, each n corresponds to exactly one zero in the function. Therefore, the number of zeros is equal to the number of integers n in that range.\n\nSo, yeah, I think 2865 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Let's compute the reciprocal of 0.0001, which is 10000, and the reciprocal of 0.001, which is 1000. So, in terms of \u03b8 = 1/x, the interval x \u2208 (0.0001, 0.001) corresponds to \u03b8 \u2208 (1000, 10000). So, \u03b8 ranges from 1000 to 10000 radians. Now, sin(\u03b8) = 0 whenever \u03b8 is an integer multiple of \u03c0, so the number of zeros in \u03b8 \u2208 (1000, 10000) is equal to the number of integers n such that n\u03c0 \u2208 (1000, 10000). So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which is the same as 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.

Since the function sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely as x approaches 0, but in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a finite interval, the function will oscillate a certain number of times, each crossing the x-axis twice per period (except maybe the first and last periods). Wait, no, actually, the zeros of sin(1/x) occur at each x = 1/(n\u03c0), so each zero is a single point where the function crosses the x-axis. So, each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept in the interval. Therefore, the number of zeros is exactly equal to the number of integers n in the range from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 2865.\n\nWait, but hold on a second: the function sin(1/x) has a period of 2\u03c0/(1/x) = 2\u03c0x, but as x changes, the period changes. Wait, no, actually, the period of sin(1/x) is not constant because as x changes, the argument 1/x changes, so the function's behavior is more complex. But in terms of zeros, each zero occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0), so each n gives exactly one zero, and there are no overlaps because each x is unique for each n. So, the count is accurate.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has zeros at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for each integer n. To find the number of zeros in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), we determine the range of n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving these inequalities gives n between approximately 318.31 and 3183.098. Thus, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive.

But wait, let me just think again: is there any possibility that some n's might give x outside the interval? For example, does n=3183 give x just barely inside, and n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0), which would be even smaller, so x=1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3184 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000.000000...).

Therefore, n=318 gives x\u22480.00100096, which is greater than 0.001, so it's excluded, which is why we start at n=319. So, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive give x within (0.0001, 0.001).

So, that's approximately 0.000100003, which is just slightly above 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 is valid. Similarly, n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0). Let's compute that: 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477, 19\u03c0 \u2248 59.690. So total is approximately 942.477 + 59.690 \u2248 1002.167. So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.167 \u2248 0.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval. Therefore, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive are valid, giving x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but just to make sure, let me check if n=3183 is indeed the last n where x is still above 0.0001. Let's compute n=3184: x=1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3184*3.1415926535). Let's compute 3184*3.1415926535. 3184*3=9552, 3184*0.1415926535\u2248 Let's compute 3184*0.1=318.4, 3184*0.04=127.36, 3184*0.0015926535\u2248 approximately 5.05. So adding up: 318.4 + 127.36 = 445.76 + 5.05 \u2248 450.81. So total is 9552 + 450.81 \u2248 9999.81. So, 3184\u03c0 \u2248 9999.81, so 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.81 \u2248 0.0001000019, which is just over 0.0001. But wait, 0.0001 is 1e-4, and 0.0001000019 is 1.000019e-4, which is greater than 0.0001. So, x=1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000019, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but that's n=3184, which would give x=0.0001000019, which is still within the interval. So, does that mean that n can go up to 3183 and beyond? Wait, no, because when n increases beyond 3183, x decreases, getting closer to 0.0001. Wait, but in our initial calculation, we found that n must be less than approximately 3183.098, so n=3183 is the last integer where x=1/(n\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. But wait, when n=3184, x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0001000019, which is still greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Wait, so perhaps my initial calculation was wrong. Let me recast the inequalities.\n\nSo, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nTaking reciprocals (and remembering that flipping inequalities when taking reciprocals because all terms are positive):\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing all parts by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nCalculating:\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098861\n\n10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098861\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.3098861 and less than 3183.098861.\n\nSince n must be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319, and the largest possible n is 3183, because 3183 < 3183.098861, so n=3183 is allowed, but n=3184 would be 3184 > 3183.098861, which would make x=1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000019, which is greater than 0.0001, so x=0.0001000019 is still in (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, that's a problem because n=3184 would give x=0.0001000019, which is still greater than 0.0001, so it's included. So, perhaps my initial upper limit was wrong. Wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, if 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, then n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098861. So, n must be greater than 318.3098861, so n starts at 319.\n\nSimilarly, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies that n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098861. So, n must be less than 3183.098861, so the maximum integer n is 3183.\n\nWait, but when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000100003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but when n=3184, x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0001000019, which is also just above 0.0001, so it's still included. But wait, according to the inequality, n must be less than 3183.098861, so n=3183 is the largest integer allowed. Wait, but 3183 is less than 3183.098861, so that's correct. So, n=3183 is allowed, but n=3184 would be 3184 > 3183.098861, which would make x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0001000019, which is still greater than 0.0001, so x is still in the interval. Wait, that's a contradiction. So, perhaps my approach is wrong. Wait, let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the inequalities. Let me re-express the inequalities correctly.\n\nGiven that x is in (0.0001, 0.001), and x=1/(n\u03c0), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nTaking reciprocals (and flipping inequalities because all terms are positive):\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nWhich is:\n\n\u2248318.3098861 < n < \u22483183.098861\n\nSo, n must be an integer strictly greater than 318.3098861 and strictly less than 3183.098861.\n\nTherefore, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest integer n is 3183, because 3183 < 3183.098861, but 3184 would be 3184 > 3183.098861, which would make 1/(3184\u03c0) < 0.0001, which is outside the interval. Wait, but earlier calculation suggested that 1/(3184\u03c0) \u22480.0001000019, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's still in the interval. So, perhaps my mistake is in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me compute 3184\u03c0 accurately.\n\nCompute 3184 * \u03c0:\n\n3184 * 3.1415926535.\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\n3184 * 3 = 9552.\n\n3184 * 0.1415926535.\n\nFirst, 3184 * 0.1 = 318.4\n\n3184 * 0.04 = 127.36\n\n3184 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 3184 * 0.001 = 3.184, and 3184 * 0.0005926535 \u2248 approximately 1.892.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n318.4 + 127.36 = 445.76\n\n445.76 + 3.184 = 448.944\n\n448.944 + 1.892 \u2248 450.836\n\nSo total is 9552 + 450.836 \u2248 9999.836.\n\nTherefore, 3184\u03c0 \u2248 9999.836, so 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.836 \u2248 0.00010000164.\n\nWhich is approximately 0.00010000164, which is greater than 0.0001 (which is 0.0001 exactly). So, 0.00010000164 is just barely above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3184 would give x=0.00010000164, which is still in the interval. Therefore, my initial upper bound was incorrect because n can go up to 3183.098861, which means n=3183 is allowed, but n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.00010000164, which is still greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Wait, that can't be right because 3184 is greater than 3183.098861, which was the upper limit for n.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inequality direction. Let me double-check.\n\nWe have 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, so n\u03c0 < 10000, so n < 10000/\u03c0 \u22483183.098861.\n\nSo, n must be less than 3183.098861, so the maximum integer n is 3183, because 3184 would be greater than 3183.098861, which would make n\u03c0 > 3183.098861 * \u03c0 \u224810000, so 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.0001, which is outside the interval.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation shows that n=3184 gives 1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.00010000164, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. So, perhaps my inequality is wrong.\n\nWait, let me take another approach.\n\nIf x must be greater than 0.0001, then 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u22483183.098861.\n\nSimilarly, x must be less than 0.001, so 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248318.3098861.\n\nTherefore, n must satisfy 318.3098861 < n < 3183.098861.\n\nSince n must be an integer, n can take values from 319 up to 3183, inclusive, because 3183 < 3183.098861.\n\nBut when n=3184, n > 3183.098861, which would imply that 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.0001, which is outside the interval. But our calculation shows that 1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.00010000164, which is still greater than 0.0001. So, perhaps there's a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let's compute 3184 * \u03c0 accurately.\n\nCompute 3184 * \u03c0:\n\n\u03c0 \u22483.141592653589793.\n\n3184 * 3 = 9552.\n\n3184 * 0.141592653589793 \u2248 Let's compute this more accurately.\n\nCompute 3184 * 0.1 = 318.4\n\n3184 * 0.04 = 127.36\n\n3184 * 0.001592653589793 \u2248 Let's compute:\n\n0.001 * 3184 = 3.184\n\n0.000592653589793 * 3184 \u2248 3184 * 0.0005 = 1.592, and 3184 * 0.000092653589793 \u2248 approximately 0.294.\n\nSo, 3.184 + 1.592 = 4.776 + 0.294 \u2248 5.07.\n\nSo, total for 3184 * 0.141592653589793 \u2248 318.4 + 127.36 = 445.76 + 5.07 \u2248 450.83.\n\nSo, total n\u03c0 \u22489552 + 450.83 \u2248 9999.83.\n\nSo, 1/(n\u03c0) \u22481/9999.83 \u22480.00010000164.\n\nWhich is greater than 0.0001, so x=0.00010000164 is in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3184 is allowed, which contradicts the earlier inequality that n must be less than 3183.098861. So, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that 3183.098861 is the exact value where 1/(n\u03c0) = 0.0001, so n=3183.098861 would give x=0.0001 exactly. But since n must be an integer, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000100003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. Similarly, n=3184 would give x\u22480.00010000164, which is also just above 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, n can go up to 3183, because n=3183 is the last integer where x=1/(n\u03c0) is just above 0.0001. Wait, but if n=3184 gives x\u22480.00010000164, which is still above 0.0001, then n=3184 is allowed, which would mean that n can go up to 3183.098861, but since n must be integer, the maximum n is 3183 because 3183.098861 is not an integer. Wait, but 3184 is greater than 3183.098861, so n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.00010000164, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, my earlier conclusion that n must be less than 3183.098861 is correct, but n can be up to 3183, but 3184 is also allowed because it's less than 3183.098861? Wait, no, 3184 is greater than 3183.098861, so n=3184 would make x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.00010000164, which is still greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, my initial upper limit was wrong. Wait, perhaps I need to compute the exact value where 1/(n\u03c0) = 0.0001, which is n=10000/\u03c0\u22483183.098861. So, any integer n less than that would give x=1/(n\u03c0) >0.0001. Therefore, n can be up to 3183, because 3183 <3183.098861, and n=3184 would be n>3183.098861, which would make x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.00010000164, which is still greater than 0.0001. So, that's a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps my initial approach is flawed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute the exact number of solutions by considering the behavior of the sine function.\n\nWait, another approach: The function y=sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. The number of oscillations increases as x approaches 0. The x-intercepts occur at 1/x = n\u03c0, so x=1/(n\u03c0). So, the number of x-intercepts between a and b is equal to the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is between a and b. So, in our case, a=0.0001, b=0.001.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is the number of integers n where 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWhich translates to 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nWhich, as before, gives 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nSo, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nWhich is approximately 318.3098861 < n < 3183.098861.\n\nSo, n can be integers from 319 up to 3183, inclusive.\n\nThus, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that n=3184 would still give x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.00010000164, which is still in the interval, so n=3184 should be included, making the count 3184 - 319 +1 = 2866. But that contradicts the inequality because n must be less than 3183.098861, so n=3184 is beyond that.\n\nWait, perhaps my confusion arises from the fact that n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.00010000164, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, n can go up to 3183, because n=3183 is the last integer where x=1/(n\u03c0) is just above 0.0001.\n\nWait, but n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.00010000164, which is still above 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, n can go up to 3183.098861, but since n must be integer, the maximum n is 3183, because 3183 < 3183.098861, and 3184 > 3183.098861, which would make x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.00010000164, which is still above 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, perhaps the correct count is from n=319 to n=3183, which is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865, and n=3184 is not included because 3184 > 3183.098861, making x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.00010000164, which is still above 0.0001, so it's included. Wait, that can't be. So, perhaps my initial approach is correct, and n=3184 is allowed, but that would mean that the upper limit is not 3183, but 3183.098861, so n can go up to 3183, because 3184 would be beyond that.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think differently. The number of x-intercepts is equal to the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001). So, the number of such n is equal to the number of integers between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, not including the endpoints because the interval is open.\n\nSo, the number of integers is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0) +1.\n\nWait, let me compute that.\n\nCompute floor(10000/\u03c0) = floor(3183.098861) = 3183.\n\nCompute ceil(1000/\u03c0) = ceil(318.3098861) = 319.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nBut wait, let me check with n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000100003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nn=3184: x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.00010000164, which is also just above 0.0001, so it's included. But according to the formula, floor(10000/\u03c0)=3183, so n=3184 is beyond that, so it's not included. Therefore, the correct count is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the function y=sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, leading to x = 1/(n\u03c0). Within the interval (0.0001, 0.001), n ranges from 319 to 3183, resulting in 2865 intercepts.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

Let me compute this step by step. 3000 * \u03c0 = 3000 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 9424.7779605. 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.1415926535. Let's compute 180\u03c0 \u2248 565.48667764 and 3\u03c0 \u2248 9.42477796. So, 565.48667764 + 9.42477796 \u2248 574.9114556. So, total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.7779605 + 574.9114556 \u2248 9999.6894161. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.6894161 \u2248 0.0001000031. So, that's approximately 0.0001000031, which is just a tiny bit above 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, for n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 1003.5, so 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, both n=319 and n=3183 are included, so the count is correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me think again: is there any possibility that between 0.0001 and 0.001, the function sin(1/x) oscillates more or less than once per each 1/x interval? Wait, no, because as x approaches 0, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), x is relatively small, but 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. So, sin(1/x) will complete a full cycle every 2\u03c0 interval in 1/x. So, the number of zeros should be approximately the number of times 1/x crosses multiples of \u03c0 in that interval. So, the number of zeros is roughly the number of times n increases by 1 as 1/x goes from 1000 to 10000. So, the number of zeros is roughly (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 \u2248 9000/3.1416 \u2248 2866. Hmm, that's close to the 2865 I calculated earlier. The slight difference is due to the endpoints. So, this makes sense. Therefore, I think my answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2865.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify x-intercepts:** The function y = sin(1/x) equals zero when sin(1/x) = 0.\n\n2. **Solve for x:** sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 = n\u03c0, where n is an integer.

    "text": " Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0 more accurately. \u03c0 \u2248 3.1415926535. So, 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let's compute 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796. Then 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 183 * 3 = 549, 183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 25.916. So, total \u2248 549 + 25.916 \u2248 574.916. So, total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796 + 574.916 \u2248 9999.69396. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.69396 \u2248 0.000100003. So, that's just slightly above 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, for n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 1003.5, so 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Therefore, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive are valid, giving 2865 x-intercepts. Wait, but let me check if n=3183 is indeed the last n where x=1/(n\u03c0) is just above 0.0001. Let's see: n=3183 gives x\u22480.000100003, which is in the interval. What about n=3184? x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22481/(3184*3.1415926535). Let's compute 3184*3.1415926535. Since 3183\u03c0\u22489999.69396, adding \u03c0 gives 3184\u03c0\u22489999.69396 + 3.1415926535\u224810002.83555. So, 1/(3184\u03c0)\u22481/10002.83555\u22480.00009997, which is less than 0.0001, so x=0.00009997 is below the lower bound of the interval, so n=3184 is excluded. Therefore, n=3183 is the last integer where x is just above 0.0001, so it's included. Similarly, n=318 gives x=1/(318\u03c0). Let's compute that: 318\u03c0\u2248318*3.1415926535\u22481000.000001, so 1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.000999999, which is just below 0.001, so it's included in the interval. So, n=318 would give x\u22480.001, but since our interval is open, x=0.001 is excluded, but n=318 gives x\u22480.000999999, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Wait, but earlier I thought n starts at 319, but now I'm seeing that n=318 gives x\u22480.000999999, which is just below 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, perhaps my initial calculation was wrong. Wait, let me go back. The inequalities were 0.0001 < x < 0.001, and x=1/(n\u03c0). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n: 1/(0.001) > n\u03c0 > 1/(0.0001). Wait, no, wait: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nWait, that's incorrect. Let me correct this.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in the initial step when solving the inequalities.\n\nLet me re-express the inequalities correctly.\n\nGiven 0.0001 < x < 0.001, and x = 1/(n\u03c0), so substituting:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nNow, solving for n:\n\nFirst inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0)\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0 (positive, so inequality remains the same):\n\n0.0001 * n\u03c0 < 1\n\nDivide both sides by 0.0001\u03c0:\n\nn < 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) = 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618\n\nSecond inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0:\n\n1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by 0.001\u03c0:\n\nn > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618\n\nSo, n must satisfy:\n\n318.30988618 < n < 3183.0988618\n\nSince n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is:\n\n3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about n=318 giving x\u22480.000999999, which is just below 0.001, so it's within the interval. So why isn't n=318 included?\n\nWait, because when solving the inequality 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, we found n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, so n must be greater than that. Since n must be an integer, the smallest integer greater than 318.30988618 is 319. So, n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.001, but since 318\u03c0 \u2248 1000, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.001, but let's compute it more accurately.\n\nCompute 318\u03c0:\n\n\u03c0 \u2248 3.1415926535\n\n318 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 318 * 3 = 954, 318 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 318 * 0.1 = 31.8, 318 * 0.04 = 12.72, 318 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 0.504.\n\nAdding up: 31.8 + 12.72 = 44.52 + 0.504 \u2248 45.024.\n\nSo, total 318\u03c0 \u2248 954 + 45.024 \u2248 999.024.\n\nSo, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/999.024 \u2248 0.001000976, which is approximately 0.001000976, which is greater than 0.001. Therefore, x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.001000976, which is just above 0.001, so it's outside the upper bound of the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=318 gives x\u22480.001000976, which is greater than 0.001, so it's excluded. Therefore, n must be greater than 318.30988618, so the smallest integer n is 319, which gives x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nSimilarly, for the lower bound, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000100003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is indeed 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n=318 gives x\u22480.001000976, which is above 0.001, so it's excluded. So, n starts at 319.\n\nSimilarly, n=3183 gives x\u22480.000100003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nTherefore, the count is from n=319 to n=3183 inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check n=3183: 3183\u03c0\u22489999.69396, so 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000100003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nSimilarly, n=3184: 3184\u03c0\u22483184*3.1415926535\u22483183\u03c0 + \u03c0\u22489999.69396 + 3.1415926535\u224810002.83555, so 1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.00009997, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded.\n\nTherefore, n=3183 is the last n included, and n=319 is the first.\n\nSo, the total number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't make any miscalculations in the range. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a +1. So, 3183 - 319 +1 = 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about it differently. Let's consider the function y = sin(1/x). The zeros occur at 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). The interval is from x=0.0001 to x=0.001. So, the smallest x in the interval is 0.0001, which corresponds to the largest n, and the largest x is 0.001, which corresponds to the smallest n.\n\nSo, n ranges from the smallest integer greater than 1/(0.001\u03c0) to the largest integer less than 1/(0.0001\u03c0).\n\nWait, 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, so the smallest integer n is 319.\n\n1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618, so the largest integer n is 3183.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about the behavior of the function near the interval. As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, and sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. But in our case, x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a finite interval, albeit very small. So, the number of zeros should correspond to how many times 1/x passes through multiples of \u03c0 in that interval.\n\nSo, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000 as x goes from 0.001 to 0.0001. So, the number of zeros is the number of multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000.\n\nSo, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nDividing by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nWhich is approximately 318.30988618 < n < 3183.0988618.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, which is 2865 integers.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the logic now.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\). This occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for some integer \\( n \\), which implies \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n\nWe need \\( x \\) to be in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\). Therefore, we solve the inequalities:\n\\[ 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\]\n\nRewriting these inequalities to solve for \\( n \\):\n1. \\( 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\)\n   \\[ 0.0001 \\cdot n\\pi < 1 \\]\n   \\[ n < \\frac{1}{0.0001\\pi} \\approx 3183.098 \\]\n\n2. \\( \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\)\n   \\[ 1 < 0.001 \\cdot n\\pi \\]\n   \\[ n > \\frac{1}{0.001\\pi} \\approx 318.309 \\]\n\nThus, \\( n \\) must be an integer such that \\( 318.309 < n < 3183.098 \\). The smallest integer \\( n \\) is 319, and the largest integer \\( n \\) is 3183.\n\nThe number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is calculated as:\n\\[ 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts is \\(\\boxed{2865}\\)."

So, yes, that's just over 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 1003.5001, so 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so included as well. Therefore, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive give x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Wait, but let me double-check that subtraction: 3183 - 319. 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, yes, 2865 x-intercepts. But just to make sure, let me consider if there's any possibility that some n's might result in x outside the interval. For example, if n were 318, then x would be 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.0) \u2248 0.001, but since 318\u03c0 is approximately 1000.0, so 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.001. But our interval is open at 0.001, so x cannot be exactly 0.001. So, n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.001, which is the upper limit, but since the interval is open, x=0.001 is excluded. Therefore, n=318 is not included, which is why we start at n=319, which gives x slightly less than 0.001. Similarly, n=3183 gives x just above 0.0001, which is included. So, our initial calculation holds. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but wait a second, let me think about the function y = sin(1/x). As x approaches 0 from the positive side, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. However, in our case, x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a small interval near zero, but the function sin(1/x) will oscillate more and more rapidly as x approaches zero. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), how does the number of oscillations translate to the number of zeros?\n\nEach time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the sine function completes a half-period, crossing zero. So, each zero crossing occurs when 1/x increases by \u03c0, which corresponds to x decreasing by approximately \u03c0/(x^2), but perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of zeros as x varies.\n\nBut in our case, we've already found that the zeros occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer n, and we've determined the range of n that places x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, the count is 2865. Therefore, I think that is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me consider the function's behavior. For x in (0.0001, 0.001), 1/x is in (1000, 10000). So, the sine function sin(\u03b8) with \u03b8 from 1000 to 10000 radians. Since sin(\u03b8) has a period of 2\u03c0, the number of zeros in this interval would be approximately the number of times \u03b8 crosses multiples of \u03c0. So, the number of zeros is roughly (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 \u2248 9000/3.1416 \u2248 2866. But wait, that's close to our earlier calculation of 2865. The slight difference is because we're counting the number of integer n's between certain bounds, which gives exactly 2865. So, this estimation also leads to about 2865 zeros, which aligns with our precise calculation.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

Similarly, for n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477796, 19\u03c0 \u2248 59.6902604. Adding: 942.477796 + 59.6902604 \u2248 1002.168056. So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.168056 \u2248 0.00099783, which is less than 0.001, so included. Therefore, n=319 gives x\u22480.00099783, which is within (0.0001, 0.001), and n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001000031, which is just above 0.0001, so also within the interval. So, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive are valid. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Wait, but let me make sure that I didn't include any n that would make x outside the interval. Let me check n=319: x\u22480.00099783 < 0.001, so included. n=3183: x\u22480.0001000031 > 0.0001, so included. What about n=3184? Let's see: n=3184, x=1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3184 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10002.7) \u2248 0.000099973, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. So, n=3184 gives x outside the interval, so we stop at n=3183. Similarly, n=318: x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.0) \u2248 0.001, but since the interval is open, x=0.001 is excluded. So, n=318 gives x\u22480.001, which is excluded, so n must start at 319. Therefore, the count is from n=319 to n=3183 inclusive. So, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. 3183 - 319: Let's compute 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 -19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2865. So, yes, 2865. Therefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me think about whether each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept. Since sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0, but in our interval, x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a very small interval near zero. But each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the sine function completes a half-period, crossing zero. So, each n corresponds to exactly one zero crossing. Therefore, the number of zeros is equal to the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001). Which is exactly what we calculated: n from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 zeros. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I didn't make any miscalculations in the range of n. Let me compute the lower bound again: 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184. So, n must be greater than this, so the smallest integer n is 319. Similarly, the upper bound: 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be less than this, so the largest integer n is 3183. Therefore, n runs from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked all the steps, and everything seems consistent. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, leading to x = 1/(n\u03c0). We seek x in (0.0001, 0.001), translating to n between 319 and 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

Let's compute this step by step. 3000 * \u03c0 = 9424.77796077. 183 * \u03c0: 100\u03c0 \u2248 314.15926535, 80\u03c0 \u2248 251.32741229, 3\u03c0 \u2248 9.42477796. So, 100 + 80 + 3 = 183. So, 100\u03c0 = 314.15926535, 80\u03c0 = 251.32741229, 3\u03c0 = 9.42477796. Adding those: 314.15926535 + 251.32741229 = 565.48667764 + 9.42477796 \u2248 574.9114556. So, total 3183\u03c0 = 9424.77796077 + 574.9114556 \u2248 9999.68941637. Therefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.68941637 \u2248 0.0001000031. So, that's just a bit over 0.0001, so it is included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 is included. Similarly, n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 1003.489. So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so included. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Wait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the calculation of 3183 - 319. Let me compute that again: 3183 minus 319. Let's subtract 300 first: 3183 - 300 = 2883. Then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, that's correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me think again: is there a possibility that when n increases, x decreases, and so the function sin(1/x) oscillates more as x approaches 0. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is very close to zero, the function oscillates rapidly. Each oscillation corresponds to a zero crossing every \u03c0/(1/x) = x/\u03c0. Wait, perhaps another way to think about it is that between each x = 1/(n\u03c0) and x = 1/((n+1)\u03c0), there's exactly one zero crossing. Wait, but actually, sin(1/x) crosses zero at each x = 1/(n\u03c0), and between each consecutive zeros, the function goes from 0 up to 1, back to 0, down to -1, and back to 0, so each period is 2\u03c0/(1/x) = 2x\u03c0. Hmm, maybe that's complicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the number of zeros is approximately the difference in 1/(n\u03c0) across the interval. Wait, but I think my initial approach is correct: each zero occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0), and n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, giving 2865 zeros. So, I think that's the answer. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me just check once more. Let me compute the lower and upper bounds for n again. The lower bound: x < 0.001, so 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, n starts at 319. Upper bound: x > 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n ends at 3183. So, n is from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked all the steps, so I'm confident that the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

Therefore, we solve the inequalities:\n\\[ 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\]\n\nRewriting these inequalities:\n1. \\( 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\) implies \\( n < \\frac{1}{0.0001\\pi} \\approx 3183.098 \\)\n2. \\( \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\) implies \\( n > \\frac{1}{0.001\\pi} \\approx 318.309 \\)\n\nThus, \\( n \\) must be an integer between 319 and 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is calculated as:\n\\[ 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts is \\(\\boxed{2865}\\)."

    "text": " Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0 more accurately. 3183 * \u03c0: Let's compute it step by step. \u03c0 \u2248 3.1415926535. 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796. 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 180\u03c0 \u2248 565.4867, and 3\u03c0 \u2248 9.42477796, so total \u2248 565.4867 + 9.42477796 \u2248 574.91147796. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796 + 574.91147796 \u2248 9999.68943796. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.68943796 \u2248 0.000100003125. So, that's approximately 0.000100003125, which is indeed greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 319*3=957, 319*0.1415926535\u2248 let's compute 319*0.1=31.9, 319*0.0415926535\u2248319*0.04=12.76, 319*0.0015926535\u22480.506. So total \u224831.9 + 12.76=44.66 + 0.506\u224845.166. So, 319\u03c0\u2248957 + 45.166\u22481002.166. Therefore, 1/(319\u03c0)\u22481/1002.166\u22480.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 2865 x-intercepts. So, I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me think if there's any possibility that some n could lead to x outside the interval. For example, if n=3183 gives x\u22480.000100003, which is just above 0.0001, so included. If n=3184, then x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22481/(10002.7)\u22480.000099973, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Similarly, n=318 gives x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22481/(1000.2)\u22480.0009998, which is just below 0.001, but wait, n=318: 318\u03c0\u22481000.2, so x\u22480.0009998, which is less than 0.001, so included. Wait, but earlier I thought n must be greater than 318.309, so n=319 is the first integer. So, n=318 would give x\u22480.0009998, which is less than 0.001, but wait, 0.0009998 is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but earlier when solving 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, we got n > 318.309, so n=319 is the first integer. But if n=318, then x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.0009998, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Wait, but that contradicts our earlier calculation. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial inequality. Let me check again. The inequality was 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, so solving for n: n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. Therefore, n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.0009998, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval. Wait, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=319 is the first integer. Therefore, n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.0009998, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval. Wait, but that seems contradictory because n=318 is less than 318.309, so according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=319 is the first integer. But wait, let me compute 1/(318\u03c0). Let's compute 318\u03c0: 318 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 318*3=954, 318*0.1415926535\u2248318*0.1=31.8, 318*0.0415926535\u224813.23, 318*0.0015926535\u22480.507. So total \u224831.8 +13.23=45.03 +0.507\u224845.537. So, 318\u03c0\u2248954 +45.537\u22481000.537. Therefore, 1/(318\u03c0)\u22481/1000.537\u22480.00099946, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But according to our inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=319 is the first integer. So, why is n=318 included? Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inequality direction. Let me re-examine that. The inequality was 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which implies n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. Therefore, n=318 is less than 318.309, so it doesn't satisfy the inequality, meaning x=1/(318\u03c0) would be greater than 0.001, but wait, earlier calculation showed x\u22480.00099946, which is less than 0.001. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inequality direction. Let me think again: If 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, then n > 1/(0.001\u03c0). So, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=319 is the first integer. But when n=318, 1/(n\u03c0)=1/(318\u03c0)= approx 0.00099946 < 0.001, which seems to contradict the inequality. Wait, that can't be. Let me check the math again. Let me compute 1/(318\u03c0). 318\u03c0 \u2248 1000.537, so 1/1000.537 \u2248 0.00099946, which is indeed less than 0.001. So, that means that for n=318, x=0.00099946 < 0.001, which is within the interval. But according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309 to satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, n=318 is less than 318.309, but x=1/(318\u03c0) is still less than 0.001. That seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inequality direction. Let me re-express it. If I have 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, then multiplying both sides by n\u03c0 (positive, so inequality remains the same) gives 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0, which leads to n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. But wait, when n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.00099946 < 0.001, which satisfies the inequality 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, that would imply that n=318 is acceptable, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, which would exclude n=318. So, there's a contradiction here. Let me think: perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the inequality. Let me re-examine the inequality step. Starting with 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Multiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0. Then, divide both sides by 0.001\u03c0: 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n. So, n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. Therefore, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=319 is the smallest integer. But when n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.00099946 < 0.001, which seems to satisfy the inequality, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is less than that and shouldn't satisfy. But in reality, when n=318, x is still less than 0.001. So, perhaps my initial approach is flawed. Maybe I should consider that n can be as low as the integer such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, perhaps I should find n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities because reciprocals reverse inequalities for positive numbers), we get 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Then, dividing by \u03c0, we get 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating those: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be integers strictly greater than 318.309 and strictly less than 3183.098. Therefore, n can be from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. So, n=319 is the first integer, and n=3183 is the last. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, that seems correct. Earlier confusion was because when n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.00099946 < 0.001, which would imply that n=318 is acceptable, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is not included. Wait, but 0.00099946 is less than 0.001, so x=0.00099946 is within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, why does the inequality say n must be greater than 318.309? Because when n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.00099946 < 0.001, which is within the interval, so n=318 should be included. But according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is less than that and not included. There's a contradiction here. Wait, perhaps the initial approach was incorrect. Let me try another approach. Let me solve for n in the inequality 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) implies that n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies that n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. So, n must satisfy 318.309 < n < 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, that's correct. The confusion was because when n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.00099946 < 0.001, which seems to be within the interval, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is excluded. Therefore, n starts at 319. So, the count is from 319 to 3183, which is 2865 integers. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n gives 318.309 < n < 3183.098. The integers n range from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

Let me compute this step by step. 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 3000 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 9424.77796. 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.1415926535. Let's compute 180 * \u03c0 \u2248 565.48667, and 3 * \u03c0 \u2248 9.42477796. So, 565.48667 + 9.42477796 \u2248 574.911447. So, total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796 + 574.911447 \u2248 9999.689407. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.689407 \u2248 0.0001000031, which is indeed just over 0.0001. So, since our interval is open at 0.0001, does 0.0001000031 lie within (0.0001, 0.001)? Yes, because 0.0001000031 > 0.0001. Therefore, n=3183 is included. Similarly, for n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 1003.41376. So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009965925, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval. Therefore, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive give x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but let me confirm that 3183 is indeed the correct upper bound. Let me check n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001000031, which is in the interval. What about n=3184? Let's compute x=1/(3184\u03c0). 3184 * \u03c0 \u2248 3184 * 3.1415926535. Let's compute 3000\u03c0\u22489424.77796, 184\u03c0\u2248578.53759. So, total\u22489424.77796 + 578.53759\u224810,003.31555. So, 1/(3184\u03c0)\u22481/10003.31555\u22480.0000999669, which is less than 0.0001. So, n=3184 gives x\u22480.0000999669, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included in the interval. Therefore, n=3183 is the last n where x is still greater than 0.0001. Similarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.0009965925, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. What about n=318? Let's check: n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0). 318\u03c0\u2248318*3.1415926535\u22481001.259. So, 1/1001.259\u22480.000998745, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Wait, but earlier I thought n starts at 319 because 1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.000998745, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Wait, but 0.000998745 is less than 0.001, so it's included in (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but earlier when I solved 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, I got n > 1000/\u03c0\u2248318.309, so n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. Wait, but here n=318 gives x\u22480.000998745, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, why did I get n>318.309? Because 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n > 1000/\u03c0\u2248318.309, so n must be at least 319. But wait, n=318 gives x\u22480.000998745, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Wait, that seems contradictory. Let me think again. The inequality is 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which implies n > 1000/\u03c0\u2248318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. But when n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.000998745, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval. So, that suggests that n can be 318 as well, because x=0.000998745 is less than 0.001. Wait, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is less than that, so it shouldn't be included. But wait, when n=318, 1/(n\u03c0)=x\u22480.000998745, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the inequality direction. Let me re-examine the inequalities. Starting with x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x=1/(n\u03c0), substituting gives 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let's solve for n in each inequality.\n\nFirst inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0)\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0: 0.0001 * n\u03c0 < 1\nDivide both sides by 0.0001\u03c0: n < 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098\n\nSecond inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0\nDivide both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309\n\nSo, n must satisfy 318.309 < n < 3183.098.\n\nSince n must be an integer, n can be from 319 up to 3183 inclusive.\n\nWait, but when n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.000998745, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. But according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is less than that, which would mean it's not included. But in reality, n=318 gives x=0.000998745, which is within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, there's a discrepancy here. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inequality direction. Let me re-express the inequalities correctly.\n\nGiven 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nLet me solve for n:\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001:\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 > 0.0001 * n\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by 0.0001\u03c0: n < 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001:\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098.\n\nTherefore, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183.\n\nBut when n=318, 1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.000998745, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval. But according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is less than that, which would mean it's not included. But in reality, n=318 gives x=0.000998745, which is within the interval. So, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the inequality.\n\nWait, let's think carefully. The inequality is 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which implies n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, meaning the smallest integer n is 319. Therefore, n=318 is not allowed because 318 < 318.309, which would mean 1/(318\u03c0) > 0.001, but that's not the case. Wait, no, 1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.000998745 < 0.001, so it's allowed. So, perhaps the inequality is not correctly capturing the direction.\n\nWait, let's think again: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n > 1/(0.001\u03c0). So, n must be greater than 318.309. Therefore, n=319 is the first integer where n > 318.309. But when n=318, 1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.000998745 < 0.001, which is allowed. So, perhaps the inequality is correct, but n=318 is allowed because 1/(318\u03c0) < 0.001, but n=318 is less than 318.309, which would imply that 1/(318\u03c0) > 0.001, which is not the case. So, I must have made a mistake in the inequality direction.\n\nWait, let's solve 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 for n:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319.\n\nBut when n=318, 1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.000998745 < 0.001, so it's allowed. So, this suggests that the inequality is not capturing the correct condition because n=318 is allowed, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, which would exclude n=318.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion comes from the fact that 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n > 318.309, but n=318 is less than 318.309, so 1/(318\u03c0) would be greater than 0.001, which is not the case. Wait, no, 1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.000998745 < 0.001, which is true, so n=318 is allowed. Therefore, my inequality must be wrong.\n\nWait, let's solve 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 again:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by 0.001: 1000 < n\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n\n\nSo, n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248318.309\n\nTherefore, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319.\n\nBut when n=318, 1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.000998745 < 0.001, so it's allowed. So, this suggests that the inequality is incorrect, which can't be. There must be a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, let me think again. If n=318, then 1/(n\u03c0)=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.000998745, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval. So, why does the inequality say n must be greater than 318.309? Because if n=318, which is less than 318.309, then 1/(n\u03c0) would be greater than 0.001, which is not the case. Therefore, my inequality must be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the inequality when multiplying both sides by n\u03c0. Let me check:\n\nStarting with 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, divide both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) \u2248318.309\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=319 is the smallest integer. But when n=318, 1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.000998745 < 0.001, which is allowed. So, this suggests that the inequality is correct, but n=318 is allowed, which contradicts the inequality. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the inequality.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is that when I multiply both sides by n\u03c0, which is positive, the inequality direction remains the same, so 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0. Therefore, n > 1000/\u03c0\u2248318.309. So, n=318 is less than 318.309, so 1/(318\u03c0) would be greater than 0.001, but that's not the case because 1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.000998745 < 0.001. Therefore, there's a contradiction here, which means I must have made a mistake in the inequality.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me consider the function y = sin(1/x). The zeros occur when 1/x = k\u03c0, where k is an integer. So, x = 1/(k\u03c0). Now, I need to find all k such that x is in (0.0001, 0.001). So, 0.0001 < 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nLet me solve for k in each inequality.\n\nFirst inequality: 1/(k\u03c0) > 0.0001\n\nMultiply both sides by k\u03c0: 1 > 0.0001 * k\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by 0.0001\u03c0: k < 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) \u22483183.098\n\nSecond inequality: 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nMultiply both sides by k\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * k\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by 0.001\u03c0: k > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) \u2248318.309\n\nSo, k must satisfy 318.309 < k < 3183.098\n\nSince k must be an integer, k starts at 319 and ends at 3183.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers k is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that when k=318, x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.000998745, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. But according to the inequality, k must be greater than 318.309, so k=319 is the first integer. So, why does k=318 give x=0.000998745, which is within the interval? It seems like a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is that when solving 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001, we get k > 318.309, so k must be at least 319. Therefore, k=318 is not allowed because it would give x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.000998745, which is less than 0.001, but according to the inequality, k must be greater than 318.309, so k=318 is less than that, which would imply x=1/(318\u03c0) > 0.001, which is not true. Therefore, the inequality must be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me consider the function f(k) = 1/(k\u03c0). We need f(k) < 0.001 and f(k) > 0.0001.\n\nSo, f(k) < 0.001 implies k > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248318.309.\n\nSimilarly, f(k) > 0.0001 implies k < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u22483183.098.\n\nTherefore, k must be in (318.309, 3183.098), so integer k from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nBut when k=318, f(k)=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.000998745 < 0.001, which is allowed, but according to the inequality, k must be greater than 318.309, so k=318 is not allowed. This suggests that there's a mistake in the inequality.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that when k=318, f(k)=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.000998745 < 0.001, which is allowed, but according to the inequality, k must be greater than 318.309, so k=318 is excluded. Therefore, the count should start at k=319, which gives f(k)=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009965925 < 0.001, which is allowed.\n\nWait, but if k=318 is allowed, then the number of x-intercepts would be 3183 - 318 +1 = 2866. But according to the inequality, k must be greater than 318.309, so k=318 is excluded. Therefore, the correct count is from k=319 to k=3183, which is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nBut I'm getting confused because when k=318, x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.000998745, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval. Therefore, k=318 should be included, making the count 3183 - 318 +1 = 2866.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in interpreting the inequality. Let me check again:\n\nWe have 0.0001 < 1/(k\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nWhich implies:\n\n1/(0.001\u03c0) < k < 1/(0.0001\u03c0)\n\nWhich is:\n\n318.309 < k < 3183.098\n\nTherefore, k must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nBut when k=318, 1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.000998745 < 0.001, so it's included, but according to the inequality, k must be greater than 318.309, so k=318 is excluded. Therefore, the count is 2865.\n\nBut wait, if k=318 is excluded, but x=1/(318\u03c0) is within the interval, that suggests that the inequality is incorrect. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in setting up the inequality.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me consider that for each x in (0.0001, 0.001), 1/x is in (1000, 10000). So, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. Therefore, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so n must satisfy n\u03c0 in (1000, 10000). Therefore, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nCalculating:\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248318.309\n\n10000/\u03c0\u22483183.098\n\nSo, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nI think this is the correct approach, and the confusion earlier was due to miscalculating the inequalities. Therefore, the final answer is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, leading to x = 1/(n\u03c0). Within the interval (0.0001, 0.001), 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. Thus, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, giving n from 319 to 3183. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

First, 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 3000 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 9424.77796. Then, 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 180 * \u03c0 \u2248 565.48667, and 3 * \u03c0 \u2248 9.42477796. So, 565.48667 + 9.42477796 \u2248 574.91144796. Adding to 9424.77796: 9424.77796 + 574.91144796 \u2248 9999.68940796. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.68940796. Therefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.68940796 \u2248 0.00010000312. Which is indeed just above 0.0001, so x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010000312 is within (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, for n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477796, 19\u03c0 \u2248 59.69026042. So, total is approximately 942.477796 + 59.69026042 \u2248 1002.168056. Therefore, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.168056 \u2248 0.00099785, which is just below 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, both n=319 and n=3183 give x within the interval, so they are included. Therefore, the total number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but just to make sure, let me think if there's any possibility that some n's might give x outside the interval. For example, if n=318, then x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.0) = 0.001, but since the interval is open, x=0.001 is excluded. So, n=318 would give x=0.001, which is not included, so n starts at 319. Similarly, n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.000000...) \u2248 0.0001, but that's also excluded because the interval is open. So, n goes up to 3183, which gives x\u22480.00010000312, which is included. So, yes, the count from 319 to 3183 inclusive is correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integers n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0).

Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000031, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included. If I go to n=3184, then x=1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3184 * 3.1415926535). Let's compute 3184 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2248 9999.6894161 + 3.1415926535 \u2248 10002.830. So, 1/10002.830 \u2248 0.0000999715, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. Therefore, n=3184 gives x=0.0000999715, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, n=3183 is indeed the largest n such that x is still in the interval. Similarly, n=318 gives x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.0) \u2248 0.001, but wait, 318\u03c0 is approximately 1000.0? Let's check: 318 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 318 * 3 = 954, 318 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 318 * 0.1 = 31.8, 318 * 0.0415926535 \u2248 approx 13.2. So total is 954 + 31.8 + 13.2 \u2248 999. So, 318\u03c0 \u2248 999, so 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.001001, which is just over 0.001. But our interval is up to 0.001, open, so x must be less than 0.001. Therefore, n=318 gives x\u22480.001001, which is outside the interval. So, n=318 is excluded, and the first n is 319, giving x\u22480.0009965, which is within the interval. Therefore, the count from n=319 to n=3183 inclusive is correct, giving 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the initial calculation of the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive. So, the formula is last - first + 1. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again: suppose I have numbers from 1 to 5, how many numbers? 5. From 2 to 5, it's 4 numbers: 2,3,4,5. So, 5-2+1=4. Correct. Similarly, from 319 to 3183, it's 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Correct.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me just think about the function y = sin(1/x). As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, and sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is very close to zero, the function oscillates a lot, crossing the x-axis many times. Each crossing corresponds to a solution of sin(1/x)=0, which as we saw, occurs at x=1/(n\u03c0) for integer n. So, the number of crossings is equal to the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001). As we calculated, that's 2865.\n\nWait, but let me just check if there's any possibility that some of these x-values might be outside the interval due to rounding errors. For example, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001000031, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included. And for n=319, x\u22480.0009965, which is just under 0.001, so included. So, all the x-values from n=319 to n=3183 are within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the count is accurate.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0) more precisely. Using calculator-like steps:\n\n\u03c0 \u2248 3.141592653589793\n\nCompute 3183 * \u03c0:\n\n3183 * 3 = 9549\n\n3183 * 0.141592653589793 \u2248 Let's compute 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3\n\n3183 * 0.041592653589793 \u2248 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32\n\n3183 * 0.001592653589793 \u2248 3183 * 0.001 = 3.183\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n0.1: 318.3\n\n0.04: 127.32\n\n0.001592653589793: approx 3.183 * 1.592653589793 \u2248 let's compute 3.183 * 1.5 = 4.7745 and 3.183 * 0.092653589793 \u2248 approx 0.295. So total \u2248 4.7745 + 0.295 \u2248 5.0695.\n\nSo, adding up all parts:\n\n3183 * 0.141592653589793 \u2248 318.3 + 127.32 + 5.0695 \u2248 450.6895.\n\nSo, total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9549 + 450.6895 \u2248 9999.6895.\n\nTherefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.6895 \u2248 0.0001000031, which is just over 0.0001, so included.\n\nSimilarly, for n=3182:\n\n3182\u03c0 \u2248 3183\u03c0 - \u03c0 \u2248 9999.6895 - 3.1415926535 \u2248 9996.5479.\n\nSo, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.5479 \u2248 0.000100034, which is still just over 0.0001, so included.\n\nWait, but wait, I think I made a miscalculation here. Because 3183\u03c0 is approximately 9999.6895, so 3182\u03c0 would be approximately 3183\u03c0 - \u03c0 \u2248 9999.6895 - 3.1415926535 \u2248 9996.5479. Therefore, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.5479 \u2248 0.000100034, which is still greater than 0.0001, so included.\n\nWait, but then n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001000031, which is just over 0.0001, and n=3182 gives x\u22480.000100034, which is also just over 0.0001. So, both are included.\n\nWait, but then what about n=3184? Let's compute 3184\u03c0 \u2248 3183\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2248 9999.6895 + 3.1415926535 \u2248 10002.8311.\n\nSo, 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/10002.8311 \u2248 0.0000999715, which is less than 0.0001, so excluded.\n\nTherefore, n=3183 is the last n where x is still greater than 0.0001.\n\nSimilarly, for n=319, x\u22480.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so included.\n\nTherefore, the count from n=319 to n=3183 inclusive is correct, giving 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I've checked the endpoints, made sure that the counts are correct, and that each n corresponds to a valid x in the interval. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) crosses the x-axis whenever 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0, i.e., at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. Within the interval (0.0001, 0.001), n ranges from 319 to 3183, yielding 2865 intercepts.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Find where sin(1/x) = 0**: This occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0).\n\n2. **Determine the range for x**: We need 0.0001 < x < 0.001.\n\n3. **Solve for n**:\n   - Lower bound: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098 \u21d2 n \u2264 3183.\n   - Upper bound: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u21d2 n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 \u21d2 n \u2265 319.\n\n4. **Count integers from 319 to 3183**: The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n**Answer**: The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

Similarly, for n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 1003.5, so 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so included. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 2865 x-intercepts. Wait, but let me check if n=3183 is indeed the last n where x is greater than 0.0001. Because if I take n=3184, then x=1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3184*3.1416) \u2248 1/(10001.3) \u2248 0.000099987, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. So, n=3183 is the largest n where x is still greater than 0.0001. Similarly, n=318 is 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.7) \u2248 0.0009993, which is just below 0.001, but wait, no, 0.0009993 is less than 0.001, so it's included. Wait, no, 0.0009993 is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Wait, but earlier I thought n starts at 319. Wait, let me recast this. So, n must satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which is n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. Similarly, n must satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which is n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so the largest integer n is 3183. So, n=319 to n=3183 inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation of 3183 - 319 +1. Let me compute 3183 minus 319. 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 -19 = 2864. Then, 2864 +1 = 2865. So, that's correct. Alternatively, think of it as the number of terms from a to b inclusive is b - a +1. So, 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about whether each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept. Since sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely as x approaches 0, but in our case, x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a small interval near zero. But in this interval, each n gives a unique x where sin(1/x)=0, so each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept. So, the total number is indeed 2865.\n\nWait, but let me just think about the function y = sin(1/x). As x approaches zero from the positive side, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. So, between x=0.0001 and x=0.001, the function completes a large number of oscillations, each crossing the x-axis twice per period (once going up, once going down). Wait, but in our case, we're only counting the zeros where sin(1/x)=0, which occur once per half-period. Wait, no, actually, sin(\u03b8) is zero at \u03b8 = n\u03c0, so each zero crossing is once every \u03c0 interval in \u03b8. Since \u03b8 = 1/x, each zero crossing occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, between x=0.0001 and x=0.001, how many times does \u03b8 go from 10000 to 100000? Because when x=0.001, \u03b8=1000, and when x=0.0001, \u03b8=10000. Wait, no, wait: when x=0.001, \u03b8=1/x=1000, and when x=0.0001, \u03b8=10000. So, \u03b8 goes from 1000 to 10000 as x goes from 0.001 to 0.0001. Wait, but that's the opposite direction. As x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, \u03b8 decreases from 10000 to 1000. So, \u03b8 goes from 10000 down to 1000. So, the number of zeros is the number of times \u03b8 crosses an integer multiple of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, solving for n: n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, that's consistent with what I found earlier.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. If \u03b8 goes from 10000 to 1000 as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, then \u03b8 is decreasing. So, each zero crossing occurs at \u03b8 = n\u03c0, which are points where \u03b8 is decreasing through n\u03c0. So, the number of zero crossings is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Which again gives n from 319 to 3183, which is 2865. So, that's consistent.\n\nWait, but let me think again: if \u03b8 starts at 10000 and decreases to 1000, the number of times it crosses a multiple of \u03c0 is the number of integers n where \u03b8 crosses n\u03c0 from above. So, starting at \u03b8=10000, which is greater than 3183\u03c0\u22489999.7128, so the first crossing is at \u03b8=3183\u03c0, then 3182\u03c0, and so on, down to \u03b8=319\u03c0\u22481003.5. So, the number of crossings is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should think about it as the number of times \u03b8 crosses a multiple of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. The number of multiples of \u03c0 in that interval is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0). Let me compute that. 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so floor(10000/\u03c0) = 3183. 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so ceil(1000/\u03c0) = 319. So, the number of multiples is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, that's another way to get the same result.\n\nWait, but I just want to make sure that I'm not missing any crossings or counting any extra. Each time \u03b8 crosses a multiple of \u03c0, sin(\u03b8) crosses zero. So, as \u03b8 decreases from 10000 to 1000, it will cross each multiple of \u03c0 exactly once, except possibly at the endpoints. But since the interval is open, we don't include \u03b8=10000 or \u03b8=1000, but we do include all the multiples of \u03c0 in between. So, the count is correct.\n\nSo, after all this thinking, I believe the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

    "text": " Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0 more accurately. \u03c0 \u2248 3.1415926535. So, 3183 * \u03c0 = 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let's compute this step by step. 3000 * \u03c0 = 9424.77796. 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.1415926535. Let's compute 180 * \u03c0 \u2248 565.48667, and 3 * \u03c0 \u2248 9.424777. So, 565.48667 + 9.424777 \u2248 574.911447. So, total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796 + 574.911447 \u2248 9999.689407. Therefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.689407 \u2248 0.0001000031, which is indeed just slightly above 0.0001. So, since our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, x=0.0001 is excluded, but x=0.0001000031 is included because it's greater than 0.0001. Therefore, n=3183 is included. Similarly, for n=319: 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 1003.5016. So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval. So, both endpoints n=319 and n=3183 are included, so the total number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Wait, but let me check that again: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that's the count. Hmm, but wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have an open interval, you might exclude some endpoints, but in this case, since n=319 gives x just below 0.001 and n=3183 gives x just above 0.0001, both are within the open interval, so they are included. Therefore, the total number is indeed 2865. But just to be absolutely sure, let me compute the exact values for n=319 and n=3183 to make sure they are within the interval. For n=319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.5016) \u2248 0.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. For n=3183: x \u2248 0.0001000031, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. So, both are included, so the count is correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again: the function y = sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. So, between x=0.0001 and x=0.001, the function oscillates rapidly. Each oscillation corresponds to a period of 2\u03c0 in the argument of the sine function. So, the number of oscillations is roughly the change in 1/x divided by 2\u03c0. Wait, let me see: the argument of the sine is 1/x, so when x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000. So, the change in 1/x is 10000 - 1000 = 9000. Each period of sine is 2\u03c0, so the number of periods is approximately 9000 / (2\u03c0) \u2248 9000 / 6.283 \u2248 1432. So, each period has two x-intercepts (except possibly the first and last), so the number of x-intercepts would be roughly twice that, so about 2864, which aligns with our earlier count of 2865. So, that makes sense. Therefore, I think the answer is 2865.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, let me compute the exact number. The number of zeros is equal to the number of n's such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001). So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, that's correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nI think that's the answer. It makes sense because as x approaches 0, the function oscillates infinitely many times, but within the finite interval (0.0001, 0.001), the number of oscillations is finite, and each oscillation contributes two x-intercepts, except possibly the first and last, but in this case, since both endpoints are open and the function approaches but doesn't reach them, all intercepts are counted. So, the total number is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

Then, 183 * \u03c0: 183 * 3 = 549, 183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 183 * 0.1 = 18.3, 183 * 0.0415926535 \u2248 approx 7.58. So total for 183\u03c0 \u2248 549 + 18.3 + 7.58 \u2248 574.88. So, total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796 + 574.88 \u2248 9999.658. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.658 \u2248 0.0001000034. So, yes, it's approximately 0.0001000034, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 is valid. Similarly, n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 1003.5. So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so included. Therefore, the count is correct: 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something else. The function sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. But in our interval, x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a very small interval near zero. However, each time x passes a point where 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0, the sine function crosses zero. So, each zero crossing corresponds to a change in the integer part of 1/(\u03c0x). But I think my initial approach is correct because each zero crossing is at x = 1/(n\u03c0), so each n gives exactly one zero crossing in that interval. Therefore, the total number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001), which we found to be n from 319 to 3183, inclusive, giving 2865 zeros.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that there's no overlap or missing points. For example, does each n correspond to exactly one x in the interval? Yes, because x = 1/(n\u03c0) is a bijection between positive integers n and positive real numbers x. So, each n gives exactly one x, and each x in the interval corresponds to exactly one n. Therefore, the count is accurate.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\). This occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for some integer \\( n \\), which implies \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n\nWe need \\( x \\) to be in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\). This translates to the inequalities:\n\\[ 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\]\n\nSolving these inequalities for \\( n \\):\n1. From \\( 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\):\n   \\[ n < \\frac{1}{0.0001\\pi} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.000314159} \\approx 3183.098 \\]\n\n2. From \\( \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\):\n   \\[ n > \\frac{1}{0.001\\pi} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.00314159} \\approx 318.309 \\]\n\nThus, \\( n \\) must be an integer in the range from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers in this range is calculated as:\n\\[ 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts is \\(\\boxed{2865}\\)."

Let me compute that step by step. 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 3000 * 3.14159265 \u2248 9424.77795. 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 Let's compute 180 * \u03c0 \u2248 565.4867, and 3 * \u03c0 \u2248 9.42477796. So, total \u2248 565.4867 + 9.42477796 \u2248 574.91147796. So, total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77795 + 574.91147796 \u2248 9999.68942796. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.68942796 \u2248 0.0001000031. So, that's approximately 0.0001000031, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 is valid. Similarly, n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.14159265 \u2248 Let's compute 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477796, 19\u03c0 \u2248 59.6902604. So, total \u2248 942.477796 + 59.6902604 \u2248 1002.1680564. So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.1680564 \u2248 0.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 2865 x-intercepts. Wait, but let me check if n=3183 is indeed the last n that gives x > 0.0001. Let's see: If n=3184, then x=1/(3184\u03c0). Let's compute 3184\u03c0: 3184 * \u03c0 \u2248 3184 * 3.14159265 \u2248 Let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77795, 184\u03c0 \u2248 184 * 3.14159265 \u2248 577.5398. So, total \u2248 9424.77795 + 577.5398 \u2248 9992.31775. So, 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/9992.31775 \u2248 0.000100076, which is greater than 0.0001, so x=0.000100076 is still in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but that contradicts my earlier assumption that n=3183 is the last n. Wait, so maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me recast the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me consider that x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nSo, solving for n:\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001:\n\nn < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001:\n\nn > 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184\n\nSo, n must be an integer satisfying 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184\n\nTherefore, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest integer n is 3183.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier when I considered n=3184, I saw that x=1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100076, which is still greater than 0.0001, so n=3184 would also give x in the interval. But according to the inequality, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so n=3183 is the largest integer less than 3183.09886184. So, n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100076, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's still in the interval. Wait, that can't be right because 3184\u03c0 is approximately 9992.31775, so 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100076, which is just barely above 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, that would mean that n can go up to 3184, but wait, 3184 is greater than 3183.09886184, which is the upper limit for n. So, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so the maximum integer n is 3183, because 3184 would be greater than that. Wait, but 3184 is greater than 3183.09886184? No, 3183.09886184 is approximately 3183.09886184, so 3184 is greater than that. So, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so the maximum integer n is 3183, because 3183 is less than 3183.09886184, and 3184 is greater. So, n=3183 is the largest integer n that satisfies n < 3183.09886184. Therefore, n=3183 is included, and n=3184 is excluded.\n\nSimilarly, n=319 is the smallest integer greater than 318.309886184.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nLet me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 is 2865.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier when I considered n=3184, I saw that x=1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100076, which is still in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, why isn't n=3184 included? Because n must be less than 3183.09886184, so 3184 is greater than that, so it's excluded. So, n=3183 is the last n.\n\nTherefore, the total number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to see if the formula holds.\n\nSuppose I have an interval (a, b), and I want to find the number of integers n such that a < 1/(n\u03c0) < b.\n\nLet me take a=0.0001 and b=0.001 as before.\n\nBut to test the formula, let's take a smaller interval, say, a=0.1 and b=0.5.\n\nSo, find n such that 0.1 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.5.\n\nSolving for n:\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.1 => n < 1/(0.1\u03c0) \u2248 31.8309886184\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.5 => n > 1/(0.5\u03c0) \u2248 6.3661977256\n\nSo, n must be integers from 7 to 31 inclusive.\n\nNumber of integers: 31 - 7 + 1 = 25.\n\nLet me list them: 7,8,9,...,31. That's 25 numbers.\n\nSo, the formula works here.\n\nSimilarly, if I take a=0.01 and b=0.02.\n\nThen, 1/(n\u03c0) must be between 0.01 and 0.02.\n\nSo, n < 1/(0.01\u03c0) \u2248 318.309886184\n\nn > 1/(0.02\u03c0) \u2248 159.154943092\n\nSo, n ranges from 160 to 318 inclusive.\n\nNumber of integers: 318 - 160 +1 = 159.\n\nWhich seems correct.\n\nSo, applying the same logic to the original problem, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integers n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need to find the number of such x in (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nSolving 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 gives n between approximately 318.31 and 3183.098. The integers n range from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The count is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.68941637 \u2248 0.0001000031. So, that's 0.0001000031, which is just slightly above 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001).
