Each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the sine function completes a half-cycle, leading to an x-intercept. So, the number of zeros should correspond to how many times 1/x crosses multiples of \u03c0 as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001. So, another way to think about it is that the number of zeros is approximately the difference in the number of times 1/x crosses n\u03c0 between x=0.001 and x=0.0001. So, the number of zeros would be the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is between 0.0001 and 0.001. Which is exactly what I calculated earlier. So, I think my reasoning is correct.

So, between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a small interval, the function oscillates rapidly, crossing the x-axis many times. Each crossing corresponds to a zero of sin(1/x), which happens at x = 1/(n\u03c0) as we established. So, the number of zeros should be proportional to the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) lies in (0.0001, 0.001). So, as we calculated, n ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 zeros.

So, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me just think again: is each n corresponding to exactly one x-intercept? Yes, because for each integer n, sin(1/x) = 0 at x = 1/(n\u03c0), and each of these x's lies within the interval. So, the count is correct.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is to consider how many times the sine function oscillates as x approaches zero. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly as x approaches zero. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a small interval near zero, the function oscillates a lot. Each oscillation corresponds to a crossing from positive to negative or vice versa, which includes two x-intercepts per period. But wait, no, actually, each period of sin(\u03b8) has two x-intercepts, but in our case, \u03b8 = 1/x, so as x decreases, \u03b8 increases. So, each time \u03b8 increases by \u03c0, we get an x-intercept. So, the number of x-intercepts is the number of times \u03b8 crosses multiples of \u03c0 as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001.\n\nAlternatively, the number of zeros can be approximated by the difference in \u03b8 between the two ends of the interval. Let's compute \u03b81 = 1/0.001 = 1000, and \u03b82 = 1/0.0001 = 10000. So, \u03b8 goes from 1000 to 10000 as x goes from 0.001 to 0.0001. The number of zeros is the number of times \u03b8 crosses a multiple of \u03c0 between \u03b8 = 1000 and \u03b8 = 10000. So, the number of zeros would be floor(10000/\u03c0) - floor(1000/\u03c0). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, compute 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.14159265 \u2248 3183.0988618\n\nSimilarly, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618\n\nSo, floor(3183.0988618) = 3183\n\nfloor(318.30988618) = 318\n\nSo, the number of zeros is 3183 - 318 = 2865.\n\nWait, that's the same result as before. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

So, 565.486677646 + 9.4247779608 \u2248 574.911455607. So total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796077 + 574.911455607 \u2248 9999.68941638. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.68941638 \u2248 0.0001000031. So, 0.0001000031 is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, for n=3184, x=1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3184 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10003.0) \u2248 0.00009997, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, n=3183 is the largest n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Similarly, for n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.0) \u2248 0.001, but let's check: 318 * \u03c0 \u2248 318 * 3.14159265 \u2248 1000.0. So, x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.001, but since our interval is open, x=0.001 is not included. Therefore, n=318 would give x=0.001, which is excluded, so the smallest n is 319, which gives x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so included. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 2865 x-intercepts. Wait, but let me make sure that between n=319 and n=3183, every integer n gives a unique x in the interval. Since each n corresponds to a unique x, and the function sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely as x approaches 0, but in our case, x is bounded away from 0 by 0.0001, so the oscillations are finite in this interval. Therefore, the number of zeros is finite and equal to the number of integers n in that range, which is 2865. So, after all that, I think the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n gives 318.309 < n < 3183.098. The integers n range from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.689415 \u2248 0.0001000031. So, 0.0001000031 is just slightly above 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 is included. Similarly, for n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535. Let's compute that. 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477796, 19\u03c0 \u2248 59.69026042. Adding them gives 942.477796 + 59.69026042 \u2248 1002.168056.

Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is indeed 2865. Wait, but let me think again: when I calculated n > 318.309, so n starts at 319, and n < 3183.098, so n ends at 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the subtraction: 3183 minus 319. Let me compute 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. So, yes, 3183 - 319 = 2864, then add 1 to get 2865. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that between 0.0001 and 0.001, the function sin(1/x) oscillates increasingly rapidly as x approaches 0. Each time 1/x passes through an integer multiple of \u03c0, the function crosses the x-axis. So, the number of crossings is essentially the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 between 1/0.001 and 1/0.0001, which is between 1000 and 10000. The number of integers between 1000 and 10000 is 9001, but since we're starting from 1000\u03c0 and going up to 10000\u03c0, we need to adjust for the exact values. Wait, but perhaps that's complicating it. Alternatively, since 1/x goes from 1000 to 10000 as x goes from 0.001 to 0.0001, the number of zeros is the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 in that interval. So, the number of n where n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which gives n between 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, which is the same as before. So, the number of integers n is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Therefore, I'm confident that the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider the function y = sin(1/x). As x approaches 0 from the positive side, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a finite interval, how many oscillations are there? Each oscillation corresponds to a period of 2\u03c0 in 1/x. So, the number of periods between x=0.001 and x=0.0001 is (1/0.001 - 1/0.0001)/ (2\u03c0) = (1000 - 10000)/(2\u03c0) = (-9000)/(2\u03c0) = -4500/\u03c0 \u2248 -1432.39. The negative sign indicates direction, but the magnitude is about 1432.39 periods. Since each period has two x-intercepts (one positive and one negative crossing), the total number of x-intercepts would be approximately 2 * 1432.39 \u2248 2864.78. Since we can't have a fraction of an intercept, we take the integer part, which is 2864 or 2865. Wait, but this is an approximation. The exact calculation earlier gave 2865, which aligns with this approximation. So, that reinforces that the answer is 2865.\n\nWait, but in the first approach, I counted the number of n's as 2865, and in this second approach, the approximation gives around 2865 as well. So, both methods agree.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the number of x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

This translates to the inequalities:\n\\[ 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\]\n\nSolving these inequalities for \\( n \\):\n1. From \\( 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\):\n   \\[ n < \\frac{1}{0.0001\\pi} \\approx \\frac{10000}{\\pi} \\approx 3183.098 \\]\n\n2.

The number of integers in this range is calculated as:\n\\[ 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\) is \\(\\boxed{2865}\\)."

If 3183\u03c0 = 10000, then 1/(3183\u03c0) = 0.0001, but since \u03c0 is irrational, 3183\u03c0 is not exactly 10000, but very close.

Similarly, n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001000031, which is just over 0.0001, so included. Therefore, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive give x in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.

The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a +1. So, from 319 to 3183, it's 3183 - 319 +1.\n\nCalculating 3183 - 319: Let's do 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 -19 = 2864. Then, 2864 +1 = 2865. So, that seems correct.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me think about how many times the sine function oscillates in this interval.\n\nThe function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more frequently as x approaches 0. So, between x=0.0001 and x=0.001, it's oscillating a lot. Each oscillation corresponds to a half-period, but each zero crossing is every \u03c0/(1/x) = x/\u03c0. Wait, maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, since each zero crossing occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0), as we've already determined, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that x is in the interval.\n\nSo, another way to think about it is: the number of zeros is equal to the number of times 1/x passes through multiples of \u03c0 as x moves from 0.001 to 0.0001. So, when x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001, 1/x increases from 1000 to 10000. So, the values of 1/x go from 1000 to 10000. The zeros occur at 1/x = n\u03c0, so n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n must be between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.309 < n < 3183.098, same as before. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, which gives 2865 integers.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0).

So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009965, which is just below 0.001, so it's included. Therefore, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive are valid, giving x in (0.0001, 0.001). Thus, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but let me check if I subtracted correctly. 3183 minus 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, yes, 2865. But just to make sure, let me think: the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Correct. Therefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, leading to x = 1/(n\u03c0). For x in (0.0001, 0.001), n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

Therefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.689416377 \u2248 0.000100003125. So, that's approximately 0.000100003125, which is indeed just above 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001).

So, both n=319 and n=3183 give x-values within the interval, so they should be included. Therefore, the total number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me think again: is there a possibility that some n's might result in x being exactly at the endpoints? But since the interval is open, we don't include x=0.0001 or x=0.001, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x\u22480.000100003, which is just above 0.0001, and n=319 gives x\u22480.00099785, which is just below 0.001. So, both are included. Therefore, the count is correct at 2865. Wait, but let me think about whether each n corresponds to a unique x in that interval. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), each n gives a unique x, and since n increases, x decreases. So, each n from 319 to 3183 corresponds to exactly one x in the interval, and they are all distinct. Therefore, the total number is indeed 2865. So, I think that's the answer. Just to recap:\n\n1. Find where sin(1/x) = 0: 1/x = n\u03c0 \u21d2 x = 1/(n\u03c0).\n2.

Therefore, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive give x in the interval. So, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Wait, but let me confirm once more. Sometimes when dealing with inequalities and reciprocals, it's easy to flip the direction. Let me re-express the original inequalities: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and remembering that flipping inequalities when taking reciprocals because all terms are positive), we get: 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Then, dividing all parts by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating these: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 +1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 is 2865. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but hold on a second, I just thought of something. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely as x approaches 0, but in this case, our interval is from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is a finite interval, albeit very close to zero. So, in this interval, the function will oscillate between -1 and 1, crossing the x-axis each time 1/x increases by \u03c0. So, each zero crossing corresponds to an increase of \u03c0 in 1/x. So, the number of zeros should be roughly the number of times 1/x can increase by \u03c0 as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001. Let me see if that aligns with our previous calculation. The difference in 1/x between x=0.001 and x=0.0001 is 1000 - 10000 = -9000, but since we're considering the interval from x=0.0001 to x=0.001, which is increasing x, so 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000. The total change in 1/x is 10000 - 1000 = 9000. Each zero crossing occurs every \u03c0 units in 1/x, so the number of zero crossings should be approximately 9000 / \u03c0 \u2248 2866. But wait, that's approximately 2866, which is close to our earlier count of 2865. Hmm, so that seems consistent. The exact number is 2865, which is very close to 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866. So, that makes sense. Therefore, I think our initial calculation is correct.\n\nWait, but why is there a slight discrepancy between 2865 and 2866? Let me check: 9000 / \u03c0 \u2248 9000 / 3.14159265 \u2248 2866.226. So, the approximate number is 2866.226, which suggests that the exact number is either 2866 or 2865, depending on how the endpoints fall. But in our earlier calculation, we found exactly 2865. So, perhaps the fractional part is due to the open interval not including the exact endpoints, which might have caused us to lose one intercept. But since in our earlier detailed calculation, we saw that n=3183 gives x just above 0.0001, which is included, and n=319 gives x just below 0.001, which is included, so both endpoints are included in the interval. Therefore, the exact count is 2865, which is just one less than the approximate value. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When we take the reciprocal of 0.0001, we get 10000, and the reciprocal of 0.001 is 1000. So, the interval for 1/x is (1000, 10000). The zeros of sin(1/x) occur at 1/x = n\u03c0, so n\u03c0 must lie between 1000 and 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, that's precise. The approximation using 9000/\u03c0 is just an estimate, and the exact count is 2865.\n\nSo, I think I've confirmed it multiple times. The number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a small interval near 0, the function will oscillate a finite number of times, each oscillation corresponding to a peak and a trough, with zeros in between.\n\nBut since we're only counting the zeros, each zero corresponds to a crossing of the x-axis, so each zero corresponds to a solution of sin(1/x) = 0, which as we determined earlier, occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer n.\n\nTherefore, the number of zeros in the interval (a, b) is equal to the number of integers n for which 1/(n\u03c0) lies in (a, b). So, in this case, a = 0.0001, b = 0.001, so we found n from 319 to 3183, which gives 2865 zeros.\n\nWait, but let me check if n=3183 is the correct upper limit. Let's compute 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000028, which is just above 0.0001, so included. What about n=3184?

Wait, no, 3184 is approximately 3184, so 3184 * \u03c0 is approximately 3184 * 3.1416 \u2248 Let's compute 3000*\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 184*\u03c0 \u2248 578.0584, so total is 9424.77796 + 578.0584 \u2248 999, but wait, 9424.77796 + 578.0584 is 999, but that can't be because 3000\u03c0 is already 9424.77796, so adding 184\u03c0 would give 9424.77796 + 578.0584 \u2248 999, but that's incorrect because 3184 is 3184, so 3184\u03c0 is approximately 3184 * 3.1416 \u2248 Let me compute 3000*3.1416 = 9424.8, 184*3.1416 \u2248 578.05, so total is 9424.8 + 578.05 \u2248 10,002.85. So, 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/10,002.85 \u2248 0.00009997, which is less than 0.0001. Therefore, x = 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009997 < 0.0001, so it's not included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).

So, x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/999.0265 \u2248 0.00100097, which is just above 0.001, so not included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=318 gives x outside the interval, so our lower bound is n=319.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3183 - 319:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\nThen, 2864 +1 = 2865.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

For example, could n=319 give x=1/(319\u03c0) which is just below 0.001, and n=3183 gives x just above 0.0001.

Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is equal to the number of integers n from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Yes, that's correct.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me think about how the function behaves. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a very small interval near zero, the function oscillates rapidly. Each time 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0, the function crosses zero. So, the number of zeros is essentially the number of times 1/x passes through \u03c0, 2\u03c0, 3\u03c0, etc., within the range from 1/0.001 = 1000 to 1/0.0001 = 10000. So, the number of zeros is the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. Wait, that's another way to think about it. So, let's see: the smallest n such that n\u03c0 > 1000, and the largest n such that n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nWait, but in our earlier approach, we had n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is equivalent to n\u03c0 being between 1000 and 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. So, that's the same as before. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that this is accurate. Let me compute 10000/\u03c0 and 1000/\u03c0 precisely.\n\n\u03c0 \u2248 3.141592653589793\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.141592653589793 \u2248 318.3098861335665\n\n10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.141592653589793 \u2248 3183.098861335665\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.3098861335665 and less than 3183.098861335665.\n\nTherefore, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest integer n is 3183.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the number of zeros is approximately (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0. Let me compute that: (10000 - 1000) = 9000. 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.197. Hmm, that's close to 2865. The difference is because we're dealing with integer counts, so the fractional part is why it's off by one. So, 2865 is the correct count.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nBut just to be absolutely thorough, let me consider edge cases. Suppose n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so included. n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000100003, which is just above 0.0001, so included in the open interval.\n\nIf n=3184: x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0000999968, which is less than 0.0001, so not included. Similarly, n=318: x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.0009996, which is greater than 0.001, so not included. So, n must be from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.69, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.69 \u2248 0.000100003. So, yes, it's just over 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477, 19\u03c0 \u2248 59.690, so total \u2248 942.477 + 59.690 \u2248 1002.167. So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.167 \u2248 0.0009978, which is just under 0.001, so it's included in the interval. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 2865 x-intercepts. Wait, but let me check if 3183\u03c0 is exactly 10000. Since 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 9999.69, which is less than 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100003, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included. So, n=3183 is included, and n=319 is included as well. Therefore, the total number is 2865. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. The number of integers n in this range is 2865.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."
