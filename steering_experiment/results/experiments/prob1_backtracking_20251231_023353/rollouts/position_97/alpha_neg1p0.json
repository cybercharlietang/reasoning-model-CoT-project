    "text": " So, the count remains 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Wait, but let me think again: the function sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches zero. So, as x approaches zero from the positive side, 1/x approaches infinity, and sin(1/x) oscillates between -1 and 1 infinitely many times. But in our case, we're only looking at x between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a finite interval, but very close to zero. So, in this interval, how many times does sin(1/x) cross zero? Each zero crossing occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0), so the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001). As we found earlier, that's n from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 2865 zeros. Wait, but just to make sure, let me think about how many periods of sin(1/x) are in this interval. The function sin(\u03b8) has a period of 2\u03c0, so each time \u03b8 increases by 2\u03c0, the function completes a cycle. Here, \u03b8 = 1/x, so as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, \u03b8 decreases from 10000 to 1000. So, the change in \u03b8 is from 10000 to 1000, which is a decrease of 9000. Each period is 2\u03c0, so the number of periods is 9000/(2\u03c0) \u2248 1432.39. But wait, that's the number of periods between \u03b8=1000 and \u03b8=10000. Each period has two zeros (at the start and end, but actually, between each maximum and minimum, there's a zero crossing). Wait, but actually, in each period, there are two zero crossings: one when going from positive to negative and another when going back. Wait, no, actually, sin(\u03b8) crosses zero once between each peak and trough. Wait, let me correct that: sin(\u03b8) crosses zero at \u03b8 = n\u03c0 for integer n, and between each \u03b8 = n\u03c0 and \u03b8 = (n+1)\u03c0, there's a peak or trough, and then another zero crossing at \u03b8 = (n+1)\u03c0. So, each zero crossing is separated by \u03c0, not 2\u03c0. So, the number of zero crossings between \u03b8 = a and \u03b8 = b is roughly |b - a|/\u03c0, rounded appropriately. So, in our case, \u03b8 goes from 10000 down to 1000, so the change is 9000. So, the number of zero crossings would be approximately 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866. But wait, that's very close to our earlier count of 2865. Hmm, that's a good consistency check. So, using the \u03b8 approach, we get approximately 2866 zero crossings, which is almost the same as our count of 2865. The slight difference is probably due to the endpoints not being included. So, that gives me more confidence that 2865 is the correct number. Therefore, I think the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). Within the interval (0.0001, 0.001), n ranges from 319 to 3183, yielding 2865 intercepts.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

    "text": " So, the count is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Wait, but let me confirm that n=3183 is indeed included. Since x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u22480.0001000028, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval. Similarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so included as well. So, all integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive are valid, leading to 2865 x-intercepts. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. When I have n starting at 319 and ending at 3183, the number of terms is (3183 - 319) +1. Let me compute 3183 - 319. 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 -19=2864. Then, +1 gives 2865. So, yes, 2865. So, that's the number of x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but I should check if there are any other considerations. For example, does sin(1/x) cross zero exactly once between each x=1/(n\u03c0) and x=1/((n+1)\u03c0)? Because sometimes functions can oscillate and cross zero multiple times between two consecutive zeros, but in this case, sin(1/x) is a standard sine function with a variable substitution, so it should cross zero exactly once between each x=1/(n\u03c0) and x=1/((n+1)\u03c0). So, each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept in the interval. Therefore, the total number is indeed 2865.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to consider the behavior of the function. As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly between -1 and 1. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a small interval near zero, the function will oscillate many times, crossing the x-axis each time 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0. Each crossing corresponds to an x-intercept at x=1/(n\u03c0). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is equal to the number of integers n for which 1/(n\u03c0) lies in (0.0001, 0.001), which we've already determined to be 2865.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the initial inequalities. So, starting with x in (0.0001, 0.001), which implies 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), substituting gives 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and remembering to reverse the inequalities because reciprocating positive numbers reverses the inequality), we get 10000 > n\u03c0 > 1000. Then, dividing by \u03c0, we have 10000/\u03c0 > n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating those: 10000/\u03c0 \u22483183.098, and 1000/\u03c0\u2248318.309. So, n must satisfy 318.309 < n < 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, but let me think about whether n=3183 is included. Since 1/(3183\u03c0) \u22480.0001000028, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.0009965, which is just below 0.001, so included as well. So, both endpoints are included in the count, hence the +1 in the formula.\n\nTherefore, after all these checks, I'm confident that the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integers n.

So, that's the number of x-intercepts. But just to make sure, let me think about how the function behaves. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is very close to 0, the function oscillates rapidly. Each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the sine function completes a half-period, so each zero crossing corresponds to an increase of \u03c0 in 1/x. So, the number of zero crossings between x=a and x=b is roughly proportional to the change in 1/x from b to a, scaled by 1/\u03c0. So, perhaps another way to compute the number of zeros is to compute the difference in 1/x at the endpoints and divide by \u03c0, then take the floor or something. Let me try that approach to verify. So, at x = 0.0001, 1/x = 10000. At x = 0.001, 1/x = 1000. So, the interval in terms of 1/x is from 1000 to 10000. The number of zeros should be approximately the number of times 1/x crosses multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, as before. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.

Therefore, both n=319 and n=3183 give x within the interval, so the count is correct at 2865.

Wait, but just to be thorough, let me check if n=3183 is indeed the last n where x=1/(n\u03c0) is just above 0.0001. If n were 3184, then x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22481/(3184*3.1415926535).

So total is 9552 +450.767\u22489999.767. Wait, that's similar to n=3183. Wait, but 3184\u03c0 would be slightly larger than 3183\u03c0, so 1/(3184\u03c0) would be slightly less than 1/(3183\u03c0), meaning x would be slightly less than 0.0001000032, but still greater than 0.0001, right? Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, n increases, so x decreases. So, as n increases, x decreases. So, n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001000032, and n=3184 would give x\u22481/(3184\u03c0)\u22481/(10000.000000something), which is approximately 0.0001, but just below 0.0001000032. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 3184\u03c0 would be approximately 3184*3.14159265\u22483184*3=9552, 3184*0.14159265\u22483184*0.1=318.4, 3184*0.04=127.36, 3184*0.00159265\u22485.007. So total\u22489552 + 318.4=9870.4 +127.36=9997.76 +5.007\u224810002.767. So, 3184\u03c0\u224810002.767, so 1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.000099972, which is less than 0.0001.

Therefore, the maximum n is 3183, as previously thought. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is indeed 2865.

Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but just to make sure, let me consider that sometimes when dealing with inequalities, especially with reciprocals and intervals, the direction can be tricky. Let me think again: x is in (0.0001, 0.001). So, 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and remembering that reciprocating reverses the inequality for positive numbers), we get 1/0.001 < 1/x < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < 1/x < 10000. Then, since 1/x = n\u03c0, we have 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing through by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating those: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098862, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be integers strictly greater than 318.3098862 and strictly less than 3183.0988618. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Yes, that's consistent.

Let's compute 3183 * \u03c0:\n\n3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute step by step.\n\nFirst, 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796\n\n183 * \u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 100\u03c0 \u2248 314.15926535, 80\u03c0 \u2248 251.327412287, 3\u03c0 \u2248 9.42477796.

Therefore, n=3183 is valid.\n\nSimilarly, let's check n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 1003.5.\n\nSo, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009965, which is less than 0.001, so it's included as well.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again: sometimes when dealing with inequalities, especially with reciprocals, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me just recap:\n\nWe have x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < x < 0.001.\n\nWe set x = 1/(n\u03c0), so substituting:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nWhich implies:\n\n1/(0.001) > n\u03c0 > 1/(0.0001)\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, if 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, then taking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities because reciprocals reverse inequalities for positive numbers):\n\n1/0.001 > n\u03c0 > 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000 > n\u03c0 > 10000\n\nWait, that can't be right because 1000 > n\u03c0 > 10000 would imply that n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000, but n is positive, so n would be between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.31 to 3183.098. So, n must be integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, which is the same as before. So, that confirms the earlier result.\n\nWait, but in my initial step, I thought that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, so taking reciprocals would give 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which leads to n between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.31 to 3183.098, same as before. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers n is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me just think about whether n=3183 is included. Since 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000031, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval. Similarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.0009965, which is just below 0.001, so it's included as well.\n\nTherefore, the total number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, let me check a smaller interval to see if the logic holds.\n\nSuppose I take the interval (0.0002, 0.0003). Then, x = 1/(n\u03c0), so 0.0002 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.0003.\n\nTaking reciprocals: 1/0.0003 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0002, which is approximately 3333.33 < n\u03c0 < 5000.\n\nSo, n must be between 3333.33/\u03c0 \u2248 1061.0 and 5000/\u03c0 \u2248 1591.549.\n\nSo, n ranges from 1062 to 1591 inclusive. The number of integers is 1591 - 1062 + 1 = 530.\n\nWait, let me check that: 1591 - 1062 = 529, plus 1 is 530. So, 530 x-intercepts in that interval.\n\nWait, let me compute 1/(1062\u03c0) and 1/(1591\u03c0) to see if they lie within (0.0002, 0.0003).\n\n1/(1062\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3334.7) \u2248 0.0003, which is the upper end, but since the interval is open, 0.0003 is excluded. Wait, but 1/(1062\u03c0) \u2248 0.0003, but it's actually slightly less than 0.0003 because 1062\u03c0 \u2248 3334.7, so 1/3334.7 \u2248 0.0003. So, 1/(1062\u03c0) is approximately 0.0003, but just a bit less, so it's within (0.0002, 0.0003). Similarly, 1/(1591\u03c0) \u2248 1/(5000) \u2248 0.0002, but again, slightly more, so it's within the interval. So, the count is 530, which seems correct.\n\nTherefore, applying the same logic to the original problem, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

As above, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 9999.7128, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000028, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). If I take n=3184, then x=1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10002.8) \u2248 0.00009997, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. Therefore, n=3183 is the largest integer such that x=1/(n\u03c0) is still greater than 0.0001. Similarly, n=318 gives x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.0) \u2248 0.001, but since the interval is open, x=0.001 is excluded, so n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009999, which is just below 0.001, so it's included. Wait, but earlier I thought n starts at 319. Wait, let me recast this. Let me compute n_min such that 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. Similarly, n_max is the largest integer such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which is n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so the largest integer n is 3183. Therefore, n runs from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, that's the count. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that between n=319 and n=3183, some x values might fall outside the interval? I don't think so because each n corresponds to a unique x in the interval. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), and as n increases, x decreases, moving from just below 0.001 down to just above 0.0001. So, every n from 319 to 3183 gives an x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the count is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check with specific numbers. Let's take n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.5) \u2248 0.0009965, which is between 0.0001 and 0.001.

So, the total number is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me compute 3183 - 319 again. 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then minus 19 more is 2864. So, 2864 +1 = 2865.

Since n must be less than 3183.098, n can be up to 3183, because 3183 is less than 3183.098. So, yes, n=3183 is allowed. Similarly, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. Therefore, the total number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that seems correct. But just to make sure, let me consider how many times the sine function oscillates as x approaches zero. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly as x approaches zero. So, between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a small interval near zero, there should be a large number of oscillations, each crossing the x-axis twice (once going up, once going down). Wait, wait a second, hold on. I think I made a mistake here. Because sin(\u03b8) crosses zero once every \u03c0 interval, not twice. Wait, no, actually, sin(\u03b8) crosses zero at every integer multiple of \u03c0, so between 0 and \u03c0, it crosses zero at \u03b8=0 and \u03b8=\u03c0. But in each period of 2\u03c0, it crosses zero twice: once at \u03b8=0 and once at \u03b8=\u03c0, then again at \u03b8=2\u03c0, etc. Wait, no, actually, sin(\u03b8) is zero at \u03b8=0, \u03c0, 2\u03c0, 3\u03c0, etc. So, each zero crossing is at \u03b8 = n\u03c0, where n is an integer. So, each time \u03b8 increases by \u03c0, sin(\u03b8) crosses zero. So, in terms of x, \u03b8 = 1/x, so as x decreases, \u03b8 increases. So, the number of zero crossings between x=a and x=b, where a < b, would correspond to the number of n such that 1/b < n\u03c0 < 1/a. So, n must satisfy n > 1/(b\u03c0) and n < 1/(a\u03c0). So, the number of integers n in that interval is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) + 1, perhaps. Wait, but in our case, a is 0.0001 and b is 0.001. So, 1/a is 10000, and 1/b is 1000. So, 1/(a\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098 and 1/(b\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. So, the number of integers n where 318.309 < n < 3183.098 is from n=319 to n=3183, inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that seems correct. Wait, but earlier I thought about each period of sin(\u03b8) being 2\u03c0, so the number of zero crossings would be roughly proportional to the length of the interval in \u03b8 divided by \u03c0. But in this case, since we're mapping it to x, it's a bit different. So, maybe I should think in terms of the change in \u03b8 as x changes from 0.0001 to 0.001. So, \u03b8 goes from 1/0.001 = 1000 to 1/0.0001 = 10000. So, \u03b8 increases from 1000 to 10000, which is an increase of 9000. So, the number of zero crossings would be how many times \u03b8 crosses a multiple of \u03c0 in that interval. So, the number of zero crossings is the number of integers n such that n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that confirms the earlier result.

Similarly, n < 3183.098, so the largest integer n is 3183. Therefore, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, the answer should be 2865 x-intercepts. I think that makes sense. Let me just visualize the graph of y = sin(1/x). As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is very close to zero, the function will oscillate a huge number of times, each oscillation corresponding to a peak and a trough, and each zero crossing corresponds to an x-intercept. So, the number of x-intercepts is proportional to the number of oscillations in that interval, which is determined by how many times 1/x passes through multiples of \u03c0. So, each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, we get another zero crossing. Therefore, the number of zero crossings is the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001), which we've calculated as 2865. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n.

But just to be absolutely sure, let me think about how the function behaves. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0 from the right. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is quite close to zero, the function oscillates rapidly. Each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the sine function completes a half-period, so each zero crossing occurs when 1/x increases by \u03c0. Therefore, the number of zero crossings is roughly the number of times 1/x can increase by \u03c0 while x remains in (0.0001, 0.001). So, the maximum value of 1/x in the interval is 1/0.0001 = 10000, and the minimum is 1/0.001 = 1000. So, the range of 1/x is from 1000 to 10000. The zeros occur at 1/x = n\u03c0, so n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000. Therefore, n must be between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately between 318.31 and 3183.098, as we found earlier.

Wait, but let me compute 3184\u03c0: 3184 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3184 * 3 = 9552, 3184 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3184 * 0.1 = 318.4, 3184 * 0.04 = 127.36, 3184 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 5.08.

So, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319.\n\nSimilarly, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the largest integer n is 3183.\n\nWait, but when I plug n=3183, I get x\u22480.0001000028, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=3184 would give x\u22480.0001000016, which is also just over 0.0001, so it's included. Wait, but that can't be right because 3184 is larger than 3183, so n=3184 would give a smaller x, but still above 0.0001. So, does that mean that n can go up to a higher number? Wait, but according to the inequality, n must be less than 3183.098, so n=3183 is the maximum integer. But wait, when I plug n=3183, I get x\u22480.0001000028, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. If I plug n=3184, x\u22480.0001000016, which is still greater than 0.0001, so it's also included. Wait, but according to the inequality, n must be less than 3183.098, so n=3183 is the maximum integer.

Hmm, so perhaps my initial inequality was incorrect.\n\nWait, let me re-express the inequality correctly. We have 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nSo, for 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001: n\u03c0 < 10000, so n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098.\n\nSimilarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001: n\u03c0 > 1000, so n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 318.309 < n < 3183.098.\n\nThus, n can be integers from 319 up to 3183, inclusive.\n\nSo, n=3183 is allowed because 3183 < 3183.098, which is true.\n\nBut wait, n=3184 would be 3184 > 3183.098, which would make 1/(3184\u03c0) < 0.0001, which would not satisfy the lower bound of the interval.\n\nBut when I calculated n=3184, I got x\u22480.0001000016, which is greater than 0.0001, which seems contradictory.\n\nWait, perhaps my approximation was off. Let me compute 3184 * \u03c0 more accurately.\n\n3184 * \u03c0 = 3184 * 3.141592653589793.\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\n3184 * 3 = 9552\n\n3184 * 0.141592653589793 \u2248 ?\n\nFirst, 3184 * 0.1 = 318.4\n\n3184 * 0.04 = 127.36\n\n3184 * 0.001592653589793 \u2248 3184 * 0.001 = 3.184, plus 3184 * 0.000592653589793 \u2248 3184 * 0.0005 \u2248 1.592, so total \u2248 3.184 + 1.592 \u2248 4.776.\n\nAdding up: 318.4 + 127.36 = 445.76 + 4.776 \u2248 450.536.\n\nSo total 3184 * \u03c0 \u2248 9552 + 450.536 \u2248 9999.536.\n\nThus, 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.536 \u2248 0.00010000468.\n\nWhich is approximately 0.00010000468, which is greater than 0.0001 (which is 0.0001 exactly). So, x=0.00010000468 is in (0.0001, 0.001). So, n=3184 would give x\u22480.00010000468, which is still in the interval.\n\nWait, but according to the inequality, n must be less than 3183.098, so n=3184 would be n=3184 > 3183.098, which would imply that x=1/(3184\u03c0) < 0.0001, but in reality, x\u22480.00010000468 > 0.0001.\n\nThis suggests that my initial inequality might have a mistake. Let me check the inequality again.\n\nWe have 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001.\n\nSo, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0 (positive, so inequality remains):\n\n1 > 0.0001 * n\u03c0\n\nThen, divide both sides by 0.0001\u03c0:\n\n1 / (0.0001\u03c0) > n\n\nWhich is 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.098 > n\n\nSo, n < 3183.098.\n\nSo, n must be less than 3183.098, meaning the maximum integer n is 3183.\n\nBut when I plug n=3184, I get x\u22480.00010000468, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. So, this seems contradictory.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inequality direction.\n\nWait, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies that n\u03c0 < 10000, so n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098.\n\nSo, n must be less than 3183.098, so n=3183 is the maximum integer.\n\nBut when n=3184, n > 3183.098, so 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.0001, which would place x outside the interval.\n\nBut in reality, when I compute n=3184, x\u22480.00010000468 > 0.0001, which is inside the interval. So, perhaps my inequality is slightly off due to rounding errors.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute 1/(n\u03c0) for n=3183 and n=3184 more accurately.\n\nLet me compute 3183 * \u03c0:\n\n3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.141592653589793.\n\nCompute 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796.\n\n183 * \u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute:\n\n180 * \u03c0 \u2248 565.48667\n\n3 * \u03c0 \u2248 9.42477\n\nTotal \u2248 565.48667 + 9.42477 \u2248 574.91144\n\nSo, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796 + 574.91144 \u2248 9999.6894\n\nThus, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.6894 \u2248 0.00010000312.\n\nSimilarly, 3184 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2248 9999.6894 + 3.1415926535 \u2248 10002.83099.\n\nThus, 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/10002.83099 \u2248 0.0000999716.\n\nWait, that's less than 0.0001, right? Because 0.0000999716 is 9.99716e-5, which is less than 0.0001 (which is 1e-4).\n\nSo, x=0.0000999716 is less than 0.0001, so it's not included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier calculation.

Therefore, n=3184 would give x outside the interval, so n=3183 is the maximum integer where x is still greater than 0.0001.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n=3184 gives x\u22480.0001000016, but that seems to have been a miscalculation. The accurate calculation shows that n=3184 gives x\u22480.00009997159, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded.\n\nTherefore, n can only go up to 3183, as n=3183 gives x\u22480.00010000312, which is just over 0.0001, thus included in the interval.\n\nSimilarly, n=3183 is the last n where x is still above 0.0001.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nThus, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nCompute that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\n2864 + 1 = 2865.\n\nTherefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but let me double-check with another approach. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. The number of oscillations increases as x gets smaller. The zeros of sin(1/x) occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0), as we established. So, the number of zeros between x = a and x = b is equal to the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is between a and b.\n\nGiven that, for a = 0.0001 and b = 0.001, we have:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) > a => n < 1/(a\u03c0)\n\n1/(n\u03c0) < b => n > 1/(b\u03c0)\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1/(b\u03c0) < n < 1/(a\u03c0)\n\nWhich is 318.309 < n < 3183.098.\n\nThus, the number of integers n is floor(3183.098) - ceil(318.309) + 1.\n\nCompute floor(3183.098) = 3183\n\nceil(318.309) = 319\n\nSo, number of n's = 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nI think that's consistent. So, the final answer is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe number of x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is found by determining the integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies within the interval. This results in n ranging from 319 to 3183, inclusive, giving 2865 intercepts.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"
