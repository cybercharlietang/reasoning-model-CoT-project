    "text": " Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), then 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me solve for n in this inequality. If I take reciprocals, remembering to reverse the inequalities because reciprocating positive numbers reverses the order, so I get 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those reciprocals: 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10,000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10,000. Now, to solve for n, I can divide all parts by \u03c0. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10,000/\u03c0. Let me compute those values. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10,000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10,000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319 and the largest possible n is 3183. Now, to find how many integers are between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1. Wait, no, actually, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check that because sometimes when dealing with inequalities, especially with reciprocals and so on, it's easy to make a mistake. So, let me confirm the steps again. Starting from x in (0.0001, 0.001), which translates to 1/x in (1000, 10000). Since sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, that's when x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, 1/(n\u03c0) must be between 0.0001 and 0.001. Which, as I did before, gives n\u03c0 between 1000 and 10000, so n between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0. Calculating those gives n between approximately 318.31 and 3183.098. So, n must be an integer from 319 up to 3183. Now, to count how many integers that is, it's 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of it as the number of integers from 1 to 3183 is 3183, and the number of integers from 1 to 318 is 318, so the number of integers from 319 to 3183 is 3183 - 318 = 2865. Yep, that checks out. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's the answer. It's a bit of a large number, but considering how rapidly sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches zero, it makes sense that there are so many intercepts in that interval.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we determine where \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\).

    "text": " Maybe it's easier if I take reciprocals to find the corresponding n values. If x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, then 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. Because 1/0.001 = 1000 and 1/0.0001 = 10000. So, 1/x is in (1000, 10000). But since 1/x = n\u03c0, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, to find the range of n, I can divide all parts by \u03c0. Let me calculate that. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. Similarly, 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be an integer such that 318.30988618 < n < 3183.0988618. Since n has to be an integer, n can take values from the next integer after 318.309..., which is 319, up to the integer before 3183.098..., which is 3183. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. Now, I need to count how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, applying that here, it's 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that. 3183 - 319 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the function, yes, sin(1/x) is zero when 1/x is a multiple of \u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). The interval for x is (0.0001, 0.001), so 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. Then, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which gives n between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0. Calculated those as approximately 318.31 and 3183.098, so n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. Counting the integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive gives 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct.

So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those reciprocals: 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Now, I can divide all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me calculate these values. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n must be the integers greater than 318.30988618 and less than 3183.09886184.

Each of these n corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, let me double-check that calculation to be sure. So, 3183 - 319 is indeed 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of it as n starting at 319 and ending at 3183, so the count is 3183 - 318 = 2865, since from 1 to 3183 is 3183 numbers, and from 1 to 318 is 318 numbers, so subtracting gives 2865.

    "text": " Let me express these numbers in terms of powers of 10 to make it easier. 0.0001 is 10^{-4}, and 0.001 is 10^{-3}. So, the interval is (10^{-4}, 10^{-3}). Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), I can substitute that into the inequality: 10^{-4} < 1/(n\u03c0) < 10^{-3}. I need to solve for n here. Let's take reciprocals on all sides, but I have to remember that taking reciprocals reverses the inequalities. So, if I take reciprocals, the inequality becomes: 10^{3} > n\u03c0 > 10^{4}. Wait, let me check that. When I take reciprocals, the direction of the inequality flips. So, starting with 10^{-4} < 1/(n\u03c0) < 10^{-3}, taking reciprocals gives 10^{3} > n\u03c0 > 10^{4}. Hmm, that seems a bit off because 10^{3} is 1000 and 10^{4} is 10000, so n\u03c0 has to be between 1000 and 10000. But that would mean n is between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute those values. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1416, so 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09. So, n must be an integer between 319 and 3183. Wait, but 318.31 is approximately 318.31, so the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest integer n is 3183 because 3183\u03c0 is just under 10000. Let me confirm: 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416. Let me compute that: 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.1416 \u2248 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, 3183 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0928. Adding those together: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62, plus 5.0928 \u2248 450.7128. So total is 9549 + 450.7128 \u2248 9999.7128, which is just under 10000. So, n can go up to 3183. Similarly, for n = 319: 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's compute 300*3.1416 = 942.48, 19*3.1416 \u2248 59.6904, so total \u2248 942.48 + 59.6904 \u2248 1002.1704. Wait, but 1002.1704 is greater than 1000, but our inequality after taking reciprocals was n\u03c0 > 1000. So, n\u03c0 must be greater than 1000, so n must be such that n\u03c0 > 1000. So, 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 1002.17, which is indeed greater than 1000. So, the smallest integer n is 319. Now, how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive? To find the number of integers, it's 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, so 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, starting with x = 1/(n\u03c0), and x is between 10^{-4} and 10^{-3}. So, 10^{-4} < 1/(n\u03c0) < 10^{-3}. Taking reciprocals, which reverses the inequalities, so 10^{3} > n\u03c0 > 10^{4}. Wait, that seems contradictory because 10^{3} is 1000 and 10^{4} is 10000, so n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000? Wait, that can't be right because 1000 is less than 10000, so the inequality should be 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Wait, no, when I take reciprocals, the inequalities reverse. So, starting with 10^{-4} < 1/(n\u03c0) < 10^{-3}, taking reciprocals gives 10^{3} > n\u03c0 > 10^{4}, but that would mean n\u03c0 is between 10^{4} and 10^{3}, which is impossible because 10^{4} is larger than 10^{3}. So, I must have made a mistake in taking reciprocals. Let me correct that. When I have 10^{-4} < 1/(n\u03c0) < 10^{-3}, taking reciprocals on all parts, remembering that for positive numbers, taking reciprocals reverses the inequalities. So, if a < b < c, then 1/a > 1/b > 1/c, provided all are positive. So, 10^{-4} < 1/(n\u03c0) < 10^{-3} implies that 10^{3} > n\u03c0 > 10^{4}. Wait, that can't be because 10^{3} is 1000 and 10^{4} is 10000, so n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000? Wait, no, that would mean n\u03c0 is greater than 1000 and less than 10000. Wait, but 10^{-4} is 0.0001, and 10^{-3} is 0.001. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals, we get 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000. Therefore, n must be between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0. So, n_min = ceiling(1000/\u03c0) and n_max = floor(10000/\u03c0). Let me compute those. 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so the smallest integer n is 319. 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so the largest integer n is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me think again: each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). Since n ranges from 319 to 3183, each n gives a unique x in the interval. So, yes, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's the correct answer. Let me just check with an example. Suppose n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.17) \u2248 0.0009978, which is approximately 0.001, but just slightly less, so it's within (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, but slightly more, so it's just inside the interval. So, all these x-values are within (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is indeed 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

Taking reciprocals (and remembering to flip the inequality when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive), we get n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n < 10000/\u03c0. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals again, we get n\u03c0 > 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Let me compute 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0 to find the range of n. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000/\u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 is 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n can take integer values from the next integer after 318.309886184, which is 319, up to the integer just below 3183.09886184, which is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers in this range, I can subtract 318 from both ends. Wait, no, more accurately, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, it's 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that. 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me check if I did that correctly. Let me recount: the number of integers from m to n inclusive is n - m + 1. So, here, m = 319, n = 3183. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. That seems right. Alternatively, I can think of it as starting from n=1, up to n=3183, which would be 3183 numbers, and then subtracting the numbers from n=1 to n=318, which is 318 numbers. So, 3183 - 318 = 2865. Yep, that matches. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For example, when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1001.69) \u2248 0.0009983, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Similarly, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.000...) which is approximately 0.0001, but since our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.0001, so x must be greater than 0.0001. Wait, so does x=1/(3183\u03c0) equal exactly 0.0001? Let me check: 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, x must be greater than 0.0001. So, does 1/(3183\u03c0) equal exactly 0.0001? Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0 more accurately. \u03c0 \u2248 3.141592653589793. So, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.141592653589793. Let me compute that step by step. 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796077. 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.141592653589793 \u2248 let's compute 180\u03c0 \u2248 565.486677646, and 3\u03c0 \u2248 9.42477796077, so total \u2248 565.486677646 + 9.42477796077 \u2248 574.911455607. So, total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796077 + 574.911455607 \u2248 10,000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.0001, x must be greater than 0.0001. So, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is not included in the interval. Therefore, n=3183 would give x=0.0001, which is not in the interval. So, the maximum n should be 3182. Let me check: 3182\u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796077, 182\u03c0 \u2248 182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 180\u03c0 \u2248 565.486677646, 2\u03c0 \u2248 6.283185307, so total \u2248 565.486677646 + 6.283185307 \u2248 571.769862953. So, total 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796077 + 571.769862953 \u2248 9996.54782372. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.54782372 \u2248 0.000100034, which is just slightly above 0.0001, so it's within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n can go up to 3182. Similarly, let's check n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 1001.6945638, so 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009983, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Now, let's recast the inequalities considering that x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let's solve for n. Starting with 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001: n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.09886184, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but as we saw earlier, n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. So, the maximum n is 3182. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001: n\u03c0 > 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184. So, the minimum integer n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Now, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1 = let's compute that. 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 is 2864. Wait, that contradicts my earlier calculation. Wait, no, 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. But earlier, I thought it was 2865. So, which is correct? Let me check with a smaller example. Suppose I have numbers from 3 to 5 inclusive. 3,4,5. That's 3 numbers. 5 - 3 +1 = 3. So, yes, the formula is correct. So, in this case, 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864. Wait, so earlier I thought n went up to 3183, but since n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, the maximum n is 3182. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but let me make sure. Let me compute 3182 - 319 +1: 3182 - 319 = 2863, +1 is 2864. So, 2864 x-intercepts. But earlier, I thought it was 2865. So, where did I go wrong? Let me recount. Initially, I thought n goes from 319 to 3183, which would be 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. But since n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is not included, we have to stop at n=3182, so the count is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864. So, the correct number is 2864. Let me verify with another approach. The x-intercepts occur at x=1/(n\u03c0) where n is an integer such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, taking reciprocals and reversing inequalities, we get 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. Therefore, n can be integers from 319 up to 3183, but wait, n=3183 would give x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded. So, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but since 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is not in the interval, we have to exclude n=3183. So, n goes up to 3182. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. The number of integers is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Therefore, the final answer is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) has x-intercepts where \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\), which occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for integer \\( n \\).

Taking reciprocals (and remembering that reversing the inequalities because reciprocals flip the inequalities for positive numbers), so 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those, 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Now, divide through by \u03c0 to solve for n. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values. First, 1000 divided by \u03c0. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319, and the largest possible n is 3183. Now, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, we can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think. If I have numbers from a to b inclusive, the count is b - a + 1. So, from 319 to 3183, it's 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and then adding 1 gives 2865. So, that would suggest there are 2865 integer values of n, each corresponding to an x-intercept in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But wait, let me double-check that. Let's confirm the range of n. We have 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so the smallest integer n is 319. Similarly, n must be less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so the largest integer n is 3183. Now, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me calculate that: 3183 minus 319 is indeed 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, that would mean there are 2865 x-intercepts. Wait a second, but I should make sure that each n in that range gives a unique x in the interval. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), each n corresponds to exactly one x, and since n increases, x decreases, so each x is unique and lies within the interval. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But let me just verify the calculations again to be sure. Let's compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more, so 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct. Alternatively, we can think of it as the number of integers between a and b, inclusive, is floor(b) - ceil(a) + 1. Here, a is 318.309886184, so ceil(a) is 319. b is 3183.09886184, so floor(b) is 3183. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Yep, that seems consistent. So, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we determine where \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\).

So, taking reciprocals, I get: 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those, 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Now, I can divide all parts of the inequality by \u03c0 to solve for n. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535.

Since n must be an integer, n has to be an integer greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184. So, n can take integer values from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to count how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. But here, the lower bound is 319 and the upper bound is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me calculate that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, and then 2864 + 1 = 2865.

Yep, that seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but let me just verify the initial step. We set sin(1/x) = 0, which implies 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0).

So, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, from the equation 1/x = n\u03c0, we can say that n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000. Therefore, n must satisfy 1000 \u2264 n\u03c0 \u2264 10000. So, n is between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute those values. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be an integer such that 318.309886184 \u2264 n \u2264 3183.09886184.

So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183, inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, plugging in, that's 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n in that range, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts in the given interval. Wait, but let me double-check that calculation. So, 3183 minus 319 is... Let me compute 3183 - 300 first, which is 2883, then subtract 19 more, which is 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct. But just to make sure, let me consider a smaller example to verify the formula. Suppose n ranges from 1 to 3. Then, 3 - 1 + 1 = 3, which is correct: 1,2,3. So, the formula works. Therefore, I can be confident that the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me think again about the endpoints. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. So, does that affect the count? Let me see: x = 1/(n\u03c0) must be strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n\u03c0 < 10000, which is already covered since n \u2264 3183. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n\u03c0 > 1000, which is also covered since n \u2265 319. So, the endpoints are excluded, but since x = 1/(n\u03c0) for n from 319 to 3183, these x's are all inside the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the count remains 2865. Wait, but let me check if n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0) which is less than 0.001? Let me compute 319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 1003. So, 1/1003 \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's included.

Wait, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but is it exactly equal? Let me compute 3183\u03c0 more accurately. 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, and 183\u03c0 \u2248 574.70987, so total is approximately 9424.77796 + 574.70987 \u2248 9999.48783. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.48783 \u2248 0.000100005, which is slightly greater than 0.0001. Therefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001, so x=1/(3183\u03c0) is included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but earlier I thought 3183\u03c0 was approximately 10000, but actually it's about 9999.48783, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100005, which is just a bit above 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, n=3183 is included. Similarly, n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1003 \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so included. So, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive give x in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the count is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but let me check n=3183: 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.48783, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100005, which is just barely above 0.0001, so included in the open interval. Similarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.000997, which is less than 0.001, so included. So, the count is 2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when I have n starting at 319 and ending at 3183, inclusive, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the number of integers between a and b inclusive is floor(b) - ceil(a) + 1. In this case, a = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so ceil(a) is 319. b = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so floor(b) is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we start by noting that \\( \\sin \\theta = 0 \\) when \\( \\theta = n\\pi \\) for some integer \\( n \\).

This translates to:\n\\[ 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\]\n\nTaking reciprocals, we get:\n\\[ 1000 < n\\pi < 10000 \\]\n\nDividing by \\( \\pi \\) (approximately 3.1415926535), we find:\n\\[ \\frac{1000}{\\pi} \\approx 318.309886184 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{10000}{\\pi} \\approx 3183.09886184 \\]\n\nThus, \\( n \\) must be an integer such that:\n\\[ 319 \\leq n \\leq 3183 \\]\n\nThe number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is calculated as:\n\\[ 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts is \\(\\boxed{2865}\\)."

    "text": " Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), I can substitute that into the inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Now, I can solve for n. Let's take the reciprocals, remembering that flipping the inequalities will reverse them because reciprocals are decreasing functions for positive numbers. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those reciprocals: 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Now, divide all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute those values. Since \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, 1000/\u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183. Now, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, actually, let me think again: the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial inequality. Let me go back. The interval for x is (0.0001, 0.001), which is between 1e-4 and 1e-3. So, x = 1/(n\u03c0) must lie in this interval. So, 1e-4 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 1e-3. Taking reciprocals (and flipping inequalities): 1e3 < n\u03c0 < 1e4. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Then, dividing by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be integers starting from the next integer after 318.309, which is 319, up to the integer just below 3183.098, which is 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n in that range. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me think again: each n gives a unique x in the interval, so the number of x-intercepts should be equal to the number of such n's. So, yes, 2865. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me check if I didn't make a mistake in the number of terms. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it as floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0) + 1. Let's see: floor(10000/\u03c0) is floor(3183.09886184) which is 3183. ceil(1000/\u03c0) is ceil(318.309886184) which is 319. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Yes, that's correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). For x in (0.0001, 0.001), we find n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing by \u03c0 gives n between approximately 318.31 and 3183.098, yielding 2865 integer values of n, hence 2865 x-intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

Starting with 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which implies n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating 1/0.0001 is 10000, so n\u03c0 < 10000, which means n < 10000/\u03c0. Similarly, from 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000, so n > 1000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values numerically. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. And 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618 and less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n has to be an integer, n can take integer values from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add one (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.

Similarly, n must be less than 3183.0988618, so the largest integer n is 3183. Now, the count is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 minus 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more to get 2864.

That's a lot of oscillations! I guess because as x gets closer to zero, 1/x becomes very large, so the sine function oscillates more and more rapidly. So, each time x decreases by a tiny amount, 1/x increases by a lot, leading to many more oscillations and thus many more x-intercepts. Yeah, that makes sense.

    "text": " Maybe it's easier if I take reciprocals to get n\u03c0. Since x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, 1/x will be between 1000 and 10000.

So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute those values. First, 1000 divided by \u03c0. Since \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, 1000/\u03c0 is about 1000 / 3.1415926535. Let me calculate that. 1000 \u00f7 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 is 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183. Now, to find how many integers are between 319 and 3183, inclusive. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, let me check that subtraction again. 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2865. So, that suggests there are 2865 integers n such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Hmm, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations. So, 1000/\u03c0 is approximately 318.309886184, so n starts at 319. 10000/\u03c0 is approximately 3183.09886184, so n goes up to 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more gives 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865. So, that seems correct. Wait, but let me think again: when n is 319, x is 1/(319\u03c0), which is approximately 1/(1002.099), which is approximately 0.000998, which is within (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, when n is 3183, x is 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0), which is 0.0001, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, does x = 0.0001 count? Wait, the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) = 0.0001, which is exactly at the lower bound. But since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so n cannot be 3183 because that would make x exactly 0.0001, which is not included. So, perhaps n goes up to 3182 instead of 3183. Let me check that. So, if n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded. So, the largest n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is when 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, solving for n: n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001 = 10000, so n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, the largest integer n is 3183, but x would be exactly 0.0001, which is excluded. So, the next lower integer is 3182. Let me check: 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000 - \u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 + something. Wait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me compute 3182\u03c0: 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 182\u03c0 \u2248 571.80391, so total \u2248 9424.77796 + 571.80391 \u2248 9996.58187. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.58187 \u2248 0.000100034, which is just a bit over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but 0.000100034 is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. So, n can be up to 3182 because 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100034 > 0.0001, so it's included. Wait, but earlier I thought that 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.0, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is exactly at the lower bound, which is excluded. So, n can be up to 3182. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 gives 2864. So, that would be 2864 x-intercepts. Hmm, so I think I made a mistake earlier by including n=3183, which gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. So, the correct count is from n=319 to n=3182, which is 2864. Wait, but let me check again. So, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is excluded, so the largest n is 3182, which gives x\u22480.000100034, which is included. So, the number of n's is from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, 3182 - 319 +1. Let me compute that again: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 is 2864. So, 2864 x-intercepts. Wait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have n from a to b inclusive, the number is b - a +1. So, if a=319, b=3182, then 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. That seems correct. So, that's the number of x-intercepts. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it as the floor of 10000/\u03c0) minus the ceiling of 1000/\u03c0) plus 1. Let me see: floor(10000/\u03c0) = floor(3183.09886184) = 3183. But since x=1/(3183\u03c0) is excluded, we take floor(10000/\u03c0) -1 = 3183 -1 = 3182. Similarly, ceiling(1000/\u03c0) = ceiling(318.309886184) = 319. So, the number of n's is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought 3183 - 319 +1 was 2865, but after correcting for the open interval, it's 2864. So, the correct answer is 2864. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of intervals. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. Each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the function completes a cycle. So, between x=a and x=b, the number of zeros is roughly the number of times 1/x passes through multiples of \u03c0. So, the number of zeros is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) +1. Wait, no, maybe it's better to think as the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (a, b). So, 1/(n\u03c0) > a => n < 1/(a\u03c0), and 1/(n\u03c0) < b => n > 1/(b\u03c0). So, n must satisfy 1/(b\u03c0) < n < 1/(a\u03c0). So, the number of integers n in that interval is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) +1. Wait, let me test that formula. So, in our case, a=0.0001, b=0.001. So, 1/(a\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u22483183.09886184, so floor(1/(a\u03c0))=3183. 1/(b\u03c0)=1000/\u03c0\u2248318.309886184, so ceil(1/(b\u03c0))=319. So, the number of integers n is 3183 - 319 +1=2865. Wait, but earlier I thought that n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so maybe it's 3183 - 319=2864, then +1? Hmm, I'm getting conflicting results here. Let me think again. The formula floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) +1 gives 3183 - 319 +1=2865. But in reality, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001, which is excluded, so n should go up to 3182, which would give floor(1/(a\u03c0))=3183, but since 3183 is excluded, the number of n's is 3182 -319 +1=2864. So, perhaps the formula needs to be adjusted for open intervals. Alternatively, maybe I should compute it as the number of integers n where 1/(n\u03c0) > a and 1/(n\u03c0) < b. So, n < 1/(a\u03c0) and n > 1/(b\u03c0). So, n must satisfy 1/(b\u03c0) < n < 1/(a\u03c0). The number of integers in that interval is floor(1/(a\u03c0)-1) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) +1. Wait, that might not be correct. Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute it as the number of integers between 1/(b\u03c0) and 1/(a\u03c0), not including the endpoints if the interval is open. So, in our case, 1/(b\u03c0)=318.309886184, and 1/(a\u03c0)=3183.09886184. So, the number of integers between these two numbers, not including the endpoints, is floor(3183.09886184 -1) - ceil(318.309886184) +1. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to stick with the initial approach. Let me list some small values to test. Suppose I have a=0.0001, b=0.001. So, 1/a=10000, 1/b=1000. So, 1/(n\u03c0) must be between 0.0001 and 0.001, so n must be between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184. So, n can be 319,320,...,3183. Now, how many numbers is that? It's 3183 -319 +1=2865. But since the interval is open, x cannot be exactly 0.0001, which corresponds to n=3183. So, n can only go up to 3182. So, the number of n's is 3182 -319 +1=2864. Therefore, the correct number is 2864. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by including n=3183, which gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. So, the correct number is 2864. Therefore, the graph of y=sin(1/x) has 2864 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of x-intercepts of \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we start by noting that \\( \\sin(\\theta) = 0 \\) when \\( \\theta = n\\pi \\) for integer \\( n \\). Thus, \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\) implies \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\), leading to \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n\nGiven \\( 0.0001 < x < 0.001 \\), taking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities) gives \\( 1000 < \\frac{1}{x} < 10000 \\).

Let's take the first inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides (and remember that flipping the inequality when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive), I get 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Calculating 1/0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Then, dividing both sides by \u03c0, I get n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.09886184.

So, n\u03c0 > 1000. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, we get n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184.

Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from sin(1/x) = 0, so 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). The interval is 0.0001 < x < 0.001, which translates to 1/(n\u03c0) between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n, as I did, gives n between 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct. I think I did everything right.

For x in (0.0001, 0.001), we find n must satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183, resulting in 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in setting up the inequalities. So, starting from x = 1/(n\u03c0), and x is in (0.0001, 0.001). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals: 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Then dividing by \u03c0 gives 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183, which is 2865 integers. That seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer n.

Let's take the reciprocal of all parts, remembering that taking reciprocals reverses the inequalities because all terms are positive. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those, 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Now, divide all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me calculate those values. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 / \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, n has to be greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184. So, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183. Now, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183, but wait, actually, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, it's 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations. The interval for n is from 319 to 3183. The number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1.

    "text": " Maybe it's easier to work with the reciprocal since x is in terms of 1/n\u03c0. So, if x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, then 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. Because 1/0.001 is 1000 and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. But since 1/x must equal n\u03c0, where n is an integer, I can set up the inequality: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute those values. First, \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 1000 / 3.1415926535. Let me compute that: 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 / \u03c0 is 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Therefore, n can take integer values starting from 319 up to 3183, because 3183 is less than 3183.09886184, and the next integer would be 3184, which is too big. Now, how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive? To find the number of integers between two numbers, we subtract the smaller from the larger and add one (since both endpoints are included). So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = let's compute that. 3183 - 319 is 2864, and then adding 1 gives 2865. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check: 3183 - 319 is 2864, yes, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, that would mean there are 2865 integer values of n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the range again. So, 1/x must be between 1000 and 10000, so n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000, so n is between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0. As I calculated, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31, so the smallest integer n is 319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so the largest integer n is 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2865. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me think again. Is there any chance that n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, inclusive, giving 2865 intercepts? Alternatively, sometimes when dealing with intervals, we have to consider whether the endpoints are included or not. In this case, the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. Therefore, 1/x cannot be exactly 1000 or 10000. So, n\u03c0 must be strictly greater than 1000 and strictly less than 10000. Therefore, n must be strictly greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so the smallest integer n is 319. Similarly, n must be strictly less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so the largest integer n is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me think again. Each integer n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). Since n ranges from 319 to 3183, each n gives a unique x in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the total number of intercepts is the number of integers in that range, which is 2865. So, I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me think about it in another way. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. The number of oscillations increases as x approaches 0. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is from x = 0.0001 to x = 0.001, the function sin(1/x) will cross the x-axis every time 1/x increases by \u03c0. So, the distance between consecutive zeros is \u03c0 in terms of 1/x. Therefore, the number of zeros is approximately the length of the interval in terms of 1/x divided by \u03c0. The length of the interval in terms of 1/x is 10000 - 1000 = 9000. So, the number of zeros would be approximately 9000 / \u03c0 \u2248 2866. But wait, that's slightly different from 2865. Hmm, so which one is correct? Let me see. The exact number is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0). So, floor(10000/\u03c0) is 3183, and ceil(1000/\u03c0) is 319. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. But when I approximated by dividing the length by \u03c0, I got 9000 / \u03c0 \u2248 2866. The difference is because the endpoints are exclusive, so maybe the approximation counts one extra. So, the exact count is 2865. Therefore, I think 2865 is the correct number of x-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, leading to x = 1/(n\u03c0). For x in (0.0001, 0.001), 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. Thus, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, or approximately 318.31 < n < 3183.098. The integers n range from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

Starting with the left inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Taking reciprocals (and remembering that flipping inequalities when taking reciprocals because all terms are positive), we get 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. 1/0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0.

Calculating those reciprocals: 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Now, I can divide through by \u03c0 to solve for n. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values numerically. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535. Let me compute that: 1000 \u00f7 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be an integer strictly greater than approximately 318.309886184 and strictly less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n can take integer values from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to count how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the numbers: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. The original interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is an open interval, so it doesn't include the endpoints. So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. Therefore, when I took the reciprocals, I correctly reversed the inequalities to get n\u03c0 between 1000 and 10000, so n is between approximately 318.31 and 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, the smallest integer n is 319 and the largest is 3183. So, the count is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, but wait, is that correct? Let me check the arithmetic again. 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of it as the number of integers from 1 to 3183 is 3183, and the number from 1 to 318 is 318, so subtracting gives 3183 - 318 = 2865. Wait, but no, that's not exactly correct because the count from 319 to 3183 inclusive is (3183 - 319) + 1, which is 2865. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 1/(n\u03c0) must be between 0.0001 and 0.001. This gives 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, leading to n between approximately 318.31 and 3183.098. The integers n range from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The count is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

To find the range of n, let me take reciprocals on all sides, remembering that flipping the inequality signs because I'm taking reciprocals of positive numbers. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those, 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Now, dividing all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n, I get 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute those values. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. But n has to be an integer. So, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183. Now, to find how many integers are between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 319 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. So, 1000 / \u03c0 is about 318.31, so n starts at 319. 10000 / \u03c0 is about 3183.098, so n goes up to 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n in that range, which would correspond to 2865 x-intercepts. But wait, I should make sure that each n in that range gives a unique x in (0.0001, 0.001). Let me check for n=319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1004.204) \u2248 0.0009958, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. For n=3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.000) \u2248 0.0001, but wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10000, so x \u2248 0.0001, but the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 is excluded. Therefore, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is exactly the lower bound, but since the interval is open, it's not included. Therefore, the largest n should be such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, let me solve for n: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n\u03c0 < 10000 \u21d2 n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but since x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded, we need to check if 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Wait, 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but exactly, since 3183\u03c0 is slightly less than 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly more than 0.0001. Wait, let me compute 3183 * \u03c0: 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let's compute 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, and 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 574.797, so total is approximately 9424.77796 + 574.797 \u2248 9999.574, so 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.574, which is just under 10000. Therefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.574 \u2248 0.00010000425, which is just over 0.0001. So, 0.00010000425 is greater than 0.0001, so x=1/(3183\u03c0) is indeed in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 is included. So, the number of n's is from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me think again. Each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept, right? Because sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches zero, but in this interval, we're looking between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000. So, sin(1/x) will cross zero each time 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0. So, the number of zeros is the number of multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. So, the number of zeros is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0). Let me compute that. 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so ceil(1000/\u03c0) = 319. 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so floor(10000/\u03c0) = 3183. Therefore, the number of zeros is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). For x in (0.0001, 0.001), we find n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing by \u03c0 gives 318.31 < n < 3183.098, so n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

    "text": " Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), let's substitute that into the inequality. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. I can rewrite these inequalities to solve for n. Let's take the left inequality first: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that flipping the inequality when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive, I get 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. 1/0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, which is approximately 3.14159, I get n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.14159 \u2248 3183.098.

Again, taking reciprocals, since both sides are positive, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n\u03c0 > 1000. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, we get n > 1000/\u03c0. Let's compute that: 1000 / 3.14159 \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309. Since n is an integer, n \u2265 319.\n\nSo, putting it all together, n must be an integer such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. To find the number of integers from a to b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, substituting a = 319 and b = 3183, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n that satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Each of these n corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0) within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 10000 / \u03c0 is approximately 3183.098, so n must be less than that, so n = 3183 is the maximum. Then, 1000 / \u03c0 is approximately 318.309, so n must be greater than that, so the next integer is 319. Then, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the number of terms in the sequence starting at 319 and ending at 3183. The formula is (last - first) + 1, which is indeed (3183 - 319) + 1 = 2865. So, that seems right.\n\nJust to make sure, let me consider a smaller example. Suppose I wanted to find the number of integers between 2 and 5 inclusive. The formula would be 5 - 2 + 1 = 4, which are 2,3,4,5. That works.

Let me compute those values. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, n can take integer values from 319 up to 3183. Wait, let me check that: the lower bound is 318.309..., so the smallest integer n can be is 319. The upper bound is 3183.098..., so the largest integer n can be is 3183. Now, to find how many integers are between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think: the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Wait, that seems too high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I should compute it as 3183 - 318 = 2865. Hmm, but wait, 319 is 318 + 1, so from 319 to 3183, that's 3183 - 318 = 2865. So, that would mean 2865 integers. But let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I should compute it as n starting at 319 and ending at 3183, so the count is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more to get 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, that's correct. Therefore, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But wait, let me think again. Is there any chance that some of these n might result in x values outside the interval? Let me check for n=319: x = 1/(319\u03c0). Let me compute 1/(319*3.1415926535). 319*3.1415926535 \u2248 319*3.1416 \u2248 319*3 = 957, 319*0.1416 \u2248 45.1644, so total \u2248 957 + 45.1644 \u2248 1002.1644. So, 1/1002.1644 \u2248 0.0009978, which is approximately 0.001. Wait, but 0.0009978 is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Similarly, for n=3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0). 3183*3.1415926535 \u2248 3183*3.1416 \u2248 Let's compute 3000*3.1416 = 9424.8, 183*3.1416 \u2248 183*3 = 549, 183*0.1416 \u2248 25.96, so total \u2248 549 + 25.96 \u2248 574.96. So, total \u2248 9424.8 + 574.96 \u2248 9999.76. So, 1/9999.76 \u2248 0.0001000024, which is just over 0.0001. So, that's within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, both ends are included, so all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive give x in the interval. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, but wait, 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, that seems correct. But let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial setup. The function is sin(1/x), and we're looking for x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, 1/x will be in (1000, 10000). So, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, 1/(n\u03c0) must be in (0.0001, 0.001), which is equivalent to n\u03c0 in (1000, 10000). So, n must be in (1000/\u03c0, 10000/\u03c0), which is approximately (318.309886184, 3183.09886184). So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check again: when n increases by 1, x decreases by 1/(n+1)\u03c0 - 1/(n\u03c0). So, each x is smaller than the previous one. So, as n increases, x decreases. So, the smallest x in the interval would be when n is largest, which is 3183, giving x \u2248 0.0001000024, which is just above 0.0001, and the largest x would be when n is smallest, which is 319, giving x \u2248 0.0009978, which is just below 0.001. So, all these x's are within the interval. Therefore, each n from 319 to 3183 gives exactly one x-intercept in the interval, and there are 2865 such n's. So, the answer is 2865.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Let me compute 3183 - 319 = 2864. Then, since both ends are included, the count is 2864 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct. So, I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

    "text": " Since x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, 1/x will be between 1000 and 10000, right? Because 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. Therefore, 1/x = n\u03c0 must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute those values. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n can take integer values from the next integer greater than 318.309886184, which is 319, up to the integer less than 3183.09886184, which is 3183. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. Now, how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive? Well, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, that would be 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n in that range. Each such n corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, 1/0.0001 is indeed 10000, and 1/0.001 is 1000. So, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. Then, n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000, so n is between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0. Calculating those: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Then, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 minus 300 is 2883, minus 19 is 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). For x in (0.0001, 0.001), 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000, so n ranges from 319 to 3183. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

I can take reciprocals on all parts, but I have to remember that taking reciprocals reverses the inequalities. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those reciprocals: 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Now, to solve for n, I can divide all parts by \u03c0. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute those values. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184.

Now, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then adjust for inclusivity. Wait, no, let me think again. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me calculate that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and then adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive.

Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more gives 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct.

    "text": " Maybe it's easier if I take the reciprocals because the inequality will reverse when I take reciprocals. So, if x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, then 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, 1/x is in (1000, 10000). Since 1/x = n\u03c0, that means n\u03c0 must be in (1000, 10000). So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. To find the range of n, I can divide all parts by \u03c0. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is about 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. But n has to be an integer, so the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1. Wait, no, actually, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and then adding 1 gives 2865. So, does that mean there are 2865 x-intercepts? Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 3183 - 319 is 2864, yes, and adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. So, x is in (0.0001, 0.001), which implies 1/x is in (1000, 10000). So, n\u03c0 must be in that interval, so n is between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.31 to 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more to get 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 is 2865. So, that seems correct. Wait, but let me think again. Each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, for each integer n from 319 to 3183 inclusive, there's exactly one x-intercept in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Hmm, but wait a second. Let me check the endpoints. The interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. So, does that affect the count? Let me see. The endpoints correspond to n = 318 and n = 3183, but since x can't be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001, those specific n values would give x exactly at the endpoints, which are excluded. So, n starts at 319 because 1/(318\u03c0) would be approximately 0.0009999, which is just below 0.001, but wait, actually, 318\u03c0 is approximately 1000, so 1/(318\u03c0) is approximately 0.001. Wait, no, 318\u03c0 is approximately 1000, so 1/(318\u03c0) is approximately 0.001, which is the upper bound. But since the interval is open at 0.001, we exclude x = 0.001, so n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0), which is just slightly above 0.001? Wait, no, 318\u03c0 is approximately 1000, so 1/(318\u03c0) is approximately 0.001, but actually, 318\u03c0 is a bit more than 1000, so 1/(318\u03c0) is a bit less than 0.001. Wait, let me compute 318 * \u03c0: 318 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 318 * 3.1416 \u2248 318 * 3 = 954, 318 * 0.1416 \u2248 45. So total \u2248 954 + 45 = 999. So, 318\u03c0 \u2248 999, so 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/999 \u2248 0.001001, which is just above 0.001. So, x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.001001, which is outside the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=318 would give x outside the upper bound, so we start at n=319, which would give x=1/(319\u03c0). Let me compute 319\u03c0: 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 300*3.1416=942.48, 19*3.1416\u224859.69, so total \u2248 942.48 + 59.69 \u2248 1002.17. So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.17 \u2248 0.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Similarly, the upper end: n=3183, so 3183\u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416. Let me compute 3000\u03c0\u22489424.77, 183\u03c0\u2248575.83, so total \u2248 9424.77 + 575.83 \u2248 10,000.6. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10,000.6 \u2248 0.0000999, which is just above 0.0001. Wait, but 0.0000999 is less than 0.0001, right? Because 0.0001 is 1e-4, which is 0.0001, and 0.0000999 is 9.99e-5, which is less than 0.0001. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999, which is just below 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. Therefore, the maximum n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001 is when n is less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, the maximum integer n is 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is just below 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3183 -1=3182. Wait, let me check: 3182\u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 3180\u03c0 + 2\u03c0 \u2248 3180*3.1416= let's compute 3000\u03c0=9424.77, 180\u03c0\u2248565.48, so 3180\u03c0\u22489424.77+565.48\u22489990.25. Then 2\u03c0\u22486.2832, so 3182\u03c0\u22489990.25 + 6.2832\u22489996.53. Therefore, 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22481/9996.53\u22480.00010003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's within the interval. So, n=3182 gives x\u22480.00010003, which is inside (0.0001, 0.001). So, n can go up to 3182. Similarly, n starts at 319, as we saw earlier. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the count is 3182 - 319 +1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 gives 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, which is correct? Let me double-check. If n starts at 319 and ends at 3182, how many terms are there? The formula is (last - first) +1. So, 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 is 2864. So, that's the correct count. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but that was when I included n=3183, which gives x just below 0.0001, which is excluded. So, actually, the correct upper limit is n=3182. So, the count is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864. Hmm, so that's the correct number. Let me just confirm with an example. Suppose I have numbers from 3 to 5 inclusive. How many numbers? 3,4,5: 3 numbers. Using the formula: 5 -3 +1=3. So, yes, correct. Similarly, from 1 to 3: 3-1+1=3. So, yes, formula works. So, in this case, 3182 -319 +1=2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought 3183 -319 +1=2865, but since n=3183 gives x just below 0.0001, which is excluded, we have to stop at n=3182. So, the correct count is 2864. Therefore, the answer is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). For x in (0.0001, 0.001), 1/x is in (1000, 10000), so n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing by \u03c0, we find n ranges from 319 to 3182. The number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\n$\\boxed{2864}$"

Calculating those values: 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10,000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10,000. Now, dividing all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10,000/\u03c0.

Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and then +1 is 2865. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. Hmm, 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so the smallest integer n is 319. Similarly, 10,000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so the largest integer n is 3183.

So, there are 2865 integers n in that range, each corresponding to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, that seems correct, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in interpreting the interval. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is from 0.0001 to 0.001, not including the endpoints. So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), the corresponding n must satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, n must be less than 1/(0.0001\u03c0) and greater than 1/(0.001\u03c0). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, let me correct that. If x = 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, then 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 10,000, so n < 10,000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184.

So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183.

Similarly, 10000 / \u03c0 is 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. But n has to be an integer, so n can take integer values from the next integer after 318.309886184, which is 319, up to the integer just below 3183.09886184, which is 3183. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. Now, to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then +1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Each of these n corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.3099, so n starts at 319. 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988, so n ends at 3183. Then, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more gives 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me think about it another way. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. In the interval from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is a very small interval near zero, the function oscillates rapidly. Each oscillation corresponds to a zero crossing, which is an x-intercept. The number of oscillations can be approximated by the difference in the arguments of the sine function at the endpoints. So, when x is 0.001, 1/x is 1000, and when x is 0.0001, 1/x is 10000. The sine function completes a full cycle every 2\u03c0, so the number of zeros should be approximately the difference in these divided by \u03c0, since each zero occurs every \u03c0 interval. So, the number of zeros would be (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 \u2248 9000 / 3.14159 \u2248 2866. But wait, that's slightly different from 2865. Hmm, maybe because when counting the number of zeros between a and b, it's the floor of b/\u03c0 minus the ceiling of a/\u03c0. Let me see: a = 1000, b = 10000. So, the number of zeros is floor(b/\u03c0) - ceil(a/\u03c0) + 1. Let me compute that. floor(10000/\u03c0) is floor(3183.0988) which is 3183. ceil(1000/\u03c0) is ceil(318.30988) which is 319. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That matches my previous result. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Solving for x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) gives x = 1/(n\u03c0) with n ranging from 319 to 3183, resulting in 2865 intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

    "text": " Maybe it's easier if I express these numbers in terms of powers of 10. So, 0.0001 is 10^-4 and 0.001 is 10^-3. So, the interval is (10^-4, 10^-3). Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), I can write the inequalities as 10^-4 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 10^-3. Let me solve for n here. Taking reciprocals (and remembering to reverse the inequalities when taking reciprocals because all terms are positive), I get 10^3 > n\u03c0 > 10^4. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check: If I have 10^-4 < 1/(n\u03c0), then taking reciprocals, since both sides are positive, I reverse the inequality: 1/(10^-4) > n\u03c0, which is 10^4 > n\u03c0. Similarly, from 1/(n\u03c0) < 10^-3, taking reciprocals, 1/(10^-3) > n\u03c0, which is 10^3 > n\u03c0. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, no, actually, when I take reciprocals, the inequalities reverse. So, starting with 10^-4 < 1/(n\u03c0), taking reciprocals gives 1/(10^-4) > n\u03c0, which is 10^4 > n\u03c0. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 10^-3 gives n\u03c0 > 10^3. So combining both, we have 10^3 < n\u03c0 < 10^4. Now, dividing all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n: 10^3/\u03c0 < n < 10^4/\u03c0. Let me compute these values. First, 10^3 is 1000, and 10^4 is 10000. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be an integer such that 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, the smallest integer greater than 318.309886184 is 319, and the largest integer less than 3183.09886184 is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1. Wait, no, let me think: The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from x = 1/(n\u03c0), and x is between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals, 10000 > n\u03c0 > 1000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing by \u03c0, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be from 319 to 3183. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then +1 gives 2865. That seems correct.

The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. To find n, I can divide all parts by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values numerically. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319 and the largest possible n is 3183. Now, to find how many integers are between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, 3183 - 318 = 2865, and adding 1 gives 2866. Wait, let me check that again. If I have numbers from a to b inclusive, the count is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, wait, that doesn't match my previous thought. Let me compute it step by step. 3183 minus 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, that's 2865 integers. But wait, earlier I thought 3183 - 318 = 2865, but that was a miscalculation. So, the correct count is 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 integer values of n that satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts in the given interval. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial substitution. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals, we get 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which is correct. So, n must be between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which are approximately 318.31 and 3183.09. Therefore, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, yes, 2865 x-intercepts. But wait, let me think again: each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept in the interval, right? Because for each n, x = 1/(n\u03c0) is unique and lies within (0.0001, 0.001). So, the number of x-intercepts is equal to the number of integers n in that range, which is 2865.

Taking reciprocals on both sides (and remembering that flipping the inequality when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive), we get 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0, which is 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, we get n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.14159265, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 10000 / 3.14159265 \u2248 3183.09886. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.09886. Since n is an integer, the maximum possible n is 3183. Now, looking at the right side of the inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.

Since n must be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the values: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, and 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers in this range. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the bounds. The original interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, meaning it doesn't include the endpoints. So, I should check if x = 1/(n\u03c0) equals exactly 0.0001 or 0.001 for any integer n. Let's see: If x = 0.0001, then 1/x = 10000, so n\u03c0 = 10000, which gives n = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886. But n must be an integer, so n = 3183 gives x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010003, which is just above 0.0001. Similarly, for x = 0.001, 1/x = 1000, so n\u03c0 = 1000, giving n = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886. The next integer is 319, so x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000984, which is just below 0.001. Wait, that's not correct. Wait, 1/(319\u03c0) is approximately 1/(1002.76) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's inside the interval. But if n = 318, then x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.31) \u2248 0.0009997, which is just below 0.001. Wait, but 0.001 is 1/1000, so 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.31) \u2248 0.0009997, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Similarly, n = 319 gives x \u2248 0.000984, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Wait, but I'm trying to see if any x = 1/(n\u03c0) equals exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. Since 0.0001 is 1/10000 and 0.001 is 1/1000, let's see if 1/(n\u03c0) can be exactly 1/10000. That would require n\u03c0 = 10000, so n = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886, which is not an integer, so x = 0.0001 is not an x-intercept. Similarly, for 0.001, n\u03c0 = 1000, so n = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886, which is also not an integer, so x = 0.001 is not an x-intercept either. Therefore, the endpoints are not included, but the x-intercepts near them are still within the interval. So, my earlier calculation stands: n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 2865 x-intercepts. I think that's correct. Let me double-check the calculations: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the total number of n's is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0) + 1. Let me compute floor(10000/\u03c0): 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so floor is 3183. ceil(1000/\u03c0) \u2248 318.309886184, so ceil is 319. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Yep, same result.

    "text": " Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), I can substitute that into the inequality. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me solve for n. First, let's invert all parts of the inequality, remembering that inverting reverses the inequality signs. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those, 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Now, to solve for n, I can divide each part by \u03c0. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute those values. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n must be greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184. So, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers, I can subtract the smaller number from the larger one and add one. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).

Let's take reciprocals on all sides, remembering that taking reciprocals reverses the inequalities because all terms are positive. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those reciprocals: 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Now, dividing all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. Now, since n must be an integer, n can take integer values from the next integer greater than 318.309886184 up to the integer less than 3183.09886184. The next integer after 318.309886184 is 319, and the integer before 3183.09886184 is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. Now, to find how many integers are in this range, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then subtract 1 because both ends are inclusive. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think: the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake with the ranges. Let me verify the inequalities again. Starting with x = 1/(n\u03c0) in (0.0001, 0.001). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0, or x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer n.

    "text": " Let me express these decimal numbers as fractions to make it easier. 0.0001 is 1/10000, and 0.001 is 1/1000. So, the interval is (1/10000, 1/1000). Therefore, I need to find all integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is between 1/10000 and 1/1000. Let me write that inequality: 1/10000 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 1/1000. To find the range of n, I can take reciprocals, but I have to remember that flipping the inequalities will reverse them because the reciprocals of smaller numbers are larger. So, flipping all parts: 10000 > n\u03c0 > 1000. Now, divide all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n: 10000/\u03c0 > n > 1000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000/\u03c0 is roughly 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n must satisfy 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184. So, n can be any integer from 319 up to 3183. Now, let me find how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. But here, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check. If n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319 first. 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then minus 19 more is 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n in that range. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me think again. Each n corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, as n increases, x decreases. So, starting from n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1004.77) \u2248 0.000995, which is just below 0.001. Similarly, n = 3183 gives x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.000...) which is approximately 0.0001. So, all these x-values lie within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, each n from 319 to 3183 gives a unique x-intercept in that interval. So, the number of x-intercepts is indeed 2865. Wait, but let me confirm the calculation again because 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, yes, that's correct. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at 1/x = n\u03c0 for integers n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), which translates to 1/10000 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 1/1000. Solving for n gives 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, leading to 318.31 < n < 3183.09. The integers n range from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The count of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"
