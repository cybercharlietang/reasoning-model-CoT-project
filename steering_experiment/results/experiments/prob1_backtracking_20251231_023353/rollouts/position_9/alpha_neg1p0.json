    "text": " Substituting x = 1/(n\u03c0), the inequality becomes 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me solve for n here. Starting with the left part: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Taking reciprocals on both sides (and remembering that flipping inequalities when reciprocating since all terms are positive) gives 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Which is 10000 > n\u03c0. So, n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating that, \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n is an integer, the maximum possible n is 3183. Now, looking at the right side of the inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000.

Since n is an integer, the smallest possible n is 319. Therefore, n ranges from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. Now, to find how many integers are in this range, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add one (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).

So, 1/(0.001) < n\u03c0 < 1/(0.0001), which simplifies to 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing each part by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. That seems correct.

Starting with 0.0001 < x < 0.001, substitute x with 1/(n\u03c0): 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Now, I can solve for n. Let's take the reciprocal of all parts, remembering that taking reciprocals reverses the inequalities. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those reciprocals: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Now, divide all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values numerically. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926536. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 1000 / 3.1415926536 \u2248 318.3098861. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is about 10000 / 3.1415926536 \u2248 3183.098861. So, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.3098861 and less than approximately 3183.098861. Since n has to be an integer, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183.

Taking reciprocals on both sides (remembering that reversing the inequality when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive), I get 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Calculating 1/0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0, which implies n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute 10000 divided by \u03c0. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n < approximately 3183.0988618. Since n is an integer, the maximum n can be is 3183. Now, the other inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals on both sides, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating 1000 divided by \u03c0, that's approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. Since n must be an integer, n must be at least 319.

So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is given by b - a + 1. So, substituting a = 319 and b = 3183:\n\nNumber of integers = 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 318 + 1 = 2865. Wait, let me check that subtraction again. 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the range. The original interval is (0.0001, 0.001). So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 1/x must be between 1000 and 10000, as I correctly found. So, n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000, so n is between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which gives n from 319 to 3183. So, the number of n's is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, yeah, 2865 intercepts. But wait, I should check if 1/(3183\u03c0) is indeed greater than 0.0001. Let me compute 1/(3183 * \u03c0). 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 let's approximate 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.14159265 \u2248 3183 * 0.14 \u2248 445.62, so total \u2248 9549 + 445.62 \u2248 9994.62. So, 1/9994.62 \u2248 0.00010005, which is just over 0.0001. So, 3183 is included. Similarly, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(319 * 3.14159265) \u2248 1/(1003.14) \u2248 0.0009968, which is just under 0.001. So, 319 is included as well. So, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive are valid, giving 2865 x-intercepts. So, I think that's the answer. Wait, but let me check if I'm not missing anything. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. So, between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a small interval near zero, it oscillates rapidly. Each oscillation corresponds to a period of 2\u03c0 in \u03b8 = 1/x. So, the number of oscillations would be roughly (1/(0.0001) - 1/(0.001)) / (2\u03c0). Let me compute that: 1/0.0001 = 10000, 1/0.001 = 1000, so difference is 9000. Divided by 2\u03c0, that's 9000/(2\u03c0) \u2248 9000/6.283 \u2248 1432. So, that's approximately the number of oscillations. But each oscillation has two x-intercepts, except maybe the first one. Wait, but in reality, each zero crossing is when sin(1/x) crosses zero, which happens once per half-period, so maybe the number of zeros is roughly the number of half-periods. Wait, but actually, the zeros occur every \u03c0 interval in \u03b8, so the number of zeros would be (\u0394\u03b8)/\u03c0, where \u0394\u03b8 is the change in \u03b8 over the interval. So, \u03b8 goes from 1000 to 10000, so \u0394\u03b8 = 9000. So, number of zeros is 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866. Wait, but I calculated 2865 earlier. Hmm, so that's close. The exact number is 2865, which is 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.18, so 2865 is the integer part. So, that matches my earlier calculation. So, I think 2865 is correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

Let's compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, and then +1 gives 2865. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. The upper bound for n is 3183, lower bound is 319. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, but let me think again: when n starts at 319, the first x-intercept is at x = 1/(319\u03c0), which is approximately 1/(1003.8), which is about 0.000996, which is just below 0.001, so that's within the interval. Similarly, the last x-intercept would be at x = 1/(3183\u03c0), which is approximately 1/(10000), which is 0.0001, but since the interval is open, it's (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, n must satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, there are 2865 x-intercepts in that interval. Wait, but let me check: for n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.000996, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. For n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0000999, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. So, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive give x in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. I think that's correct. So, the final answer is 2865.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of x-intercepts of \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we find where \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\).

To find the range of n, I can take reciprocals on all parts, but I have to remember that taking reciprocals reverses the inequalities. So, let's invert each part: 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those, 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Now, I can divide each part by \u03c0 to solve for n. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute those values. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is about 1000/3.1415926535. Let me compute that: 1000 \u00f7 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is 10000/3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. But n has to be an integer because it's in the equation x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, n can take integer values starting from the next integer after 318.309886184, which is 319, up to the integer just below 3183.09886184, which is 3183. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, no, actually, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Each of these n's corresponds to an x-intercept in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so the next integer is 319. Then, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so the last integer is 3183. Now, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more to get 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 is 2865. That seems correct. So, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals gives 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, leading to 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.

Starting with the left part: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that taking reciprocals reverses the inequality because both sides are positive, I get 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. 1/0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, I get n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me calculate that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n is an integer, n \u2264 3183. Now, the right part of the inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, which reverses the inequality, I get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618.

Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, substituting the values, it's 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again. Starting with n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, so n starts at 319. Then, n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618, so n ends at 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me think again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the reciprocal steps. Let me double-check. The original inequalities are 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, taking reciprocals, since all terms are positive, the inequalities reverse. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing all parts by \u03c0, we get 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. As before, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, so n > 318.30988618, so n starts at 319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618, so n < 3183.0988618, so n ends at 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but let me think about whether x must be strictly between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, x = 1/(n\u03c0) must satisfy 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.9) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. When n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0001) \u2248 0.000099999, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. So, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive give x in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a miscalculation in the number of integers. Let's compute 3183 - 319 + 1. 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Yeah, that's correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0. Solving for x within (0.0001, 0.001) gives n ranging from 319 to 3183, resulting in 2865 intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

So, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183. Now, to find how many integers are in this range from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is given by b - a + 1. So, plugging in the numbers: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me calculate that. 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in that interval. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the inequalities: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. Yep, that seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, leading to x = 1/(n\u03c0). For x in (0.0001, 0.001), n ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 intercepts.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

    "text": " Substituting x with 1/(n\u03c0), I get 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. I can rewrite this inequality to solve for n. Let me take the reciprocal of all parts, remembering that taking reciprocals reverses the inequalities. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those reciprocals: 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Now, I'll divide all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute those values. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535. Let me compute that: 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 / \u03c0 is 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. Now, n has to be an integer, so n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319 (since 318.309... is just above 318, so the next integer is 319), and the largest possible n is 3183 (since 3183.098... is just below 3184, so the integer part is 3183). Now, I need to count how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the values: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that. 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, let me double-check that calculation to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 3183 - 319 is indeed 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct. Hmm, but let me think again: the interval for n is from 319 to 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. Yes, that seems right. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I don't think I made a mistake here, but just to be thorough, let me consider the endpoints. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. So, we need to ensure that x = 1/(n\u03c0) is strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. So, when n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0). Let me compute 1/(319 * 3.1415926535). 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 1002. So, 1/1002 \u2248 0.000998, which is approximately 0.001, but since 0.000998 is less than 0.001, it's within the interval. Similarly, when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, but since it's 1/(3183\u03c0), which is slightly more than 0.0001, because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but just a bit larger. Wait, but 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000, 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001. Wait, that can't be right because 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but if 3183\u03c0 is just a bit more than 10000, then 1/(3183\u03c0) is just a bit less than 0.0001. Wait, but our interval is x > 0.0001, so x must be greater than 0.0001. So, does x = 1/(3183\u03c0) lie within the interval? Let me compute 3183\u03c0 exactly. 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute that: 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 183\u03c0 \u2248 574.545, so total is approximately 9424.77796 + 574.545 \u2248 9999.32296. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.32296, which is just a bit less than 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.32296 \u2248 0.0001000067, which is just a bit more than 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001000067, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's within the interval. Similarly, for n = 319, 319\u03c0 \u2248 1002.002, so 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000998, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, both n = 319 and n = 3183 give x values within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, both ends are included, so our count from 319 to 3183 inclusive is correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that makes sense. So, the answer is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

Starting with the left inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that flipping inequalities when taking reciprocals reverses them, I get 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. 1/0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, n < 10000/\u03c0. Similarly, the right inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals again, 1/0.001 > n\u03c0, which is 1000 > n\u03c0. So, n < 1000/\u03c0. Wait, but I think I made a mistake there. Let me check. If 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, then n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. So, putting it together, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Now, I can compute these values numerically. Let me approximate \u03c0 as 3.1415926535. So, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n must be from 319 up to 3183. Now, to find how many integers are in this range, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, 3183 - 318 = 2865, and adding 1 gives 2866. Wait, but let me check: if n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 is 2865. Hmm, so that's conflicting with my earlier thought. Let me think again. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, if a = 319 and b = 3183, then the count is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but I should double-check my inequalities. Let me confirm that when x = 1/(n\u03c0), x is indeed between 0.0001 and 0.001. For n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.098) \u2248 0.000997, which is just below 0.001, so that's within the interval. For n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.000...) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound. So, both endpoints are included, so yes, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, giving 2865 intercepts. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial step. When I set 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, for x to be in (0.0001, 0.001), 1/(n\u03c0) must be in that interval. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and flipping inequalities), 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. That's correct. So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. Similarly, n must be less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so the largest integer n is 3183.

First, I can take the reciprocal of all parts, remembering that flipping inequalities reverses them if I'm taking reciprocals of positive numbers, which I am here since 0.0001 and 0.001 are positive. So, taking reciprocals, I get 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those reciprocals: 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Now, I can divide all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n. Let me compute 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, the inequality becomes 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n can take integer values starting from the next integer after 318.309886184, which is 319, up to the integer just before 3183.09886184, which is 3183. Now, to find how many integers are in this range from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, no, let me correct that. If I have numbers from a to b inclusive, the count is b - a + 1. But here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that. 3183 - 319 is 2864, then adding 1 gives 2865. So, that suggests there are 2865 integer values of n in that range, each corresponding to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts should be 2865. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a lot of intercepts. Let me go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, starting with the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is from 10^{-4} to 10^{-3}. Then, x = 1/(n\u03c0) must lie in that interval, so 10^{-4} < 1/(n\u03c0) < 10^{-3}. Taking reciprocals, 10^3 < n\u03c0 < 10^4, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing by \u03c0, we get 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be an integer from 319 up to 3183. Now, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more to get 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, that seems correct. Hmm, but 2865 intercepts in that small interval seems a bit high, but considering that as x approaches zero, 1/x becomes very large, and sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. However, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), it's a finite interval, so the number of oscillations should be finite, which it is here, 2865. Let me check if I did the arithmetic correctly for the number of integers. 3183 - 319 is indeed 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Alternatively, I can think of it as starting at n=1, up to n=3183, which would be 3183 terms, then subtract the first 318 terms (from n=1 to n=318), so 3183 - 318 = 2865. That makes sense.

Substituting \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\) into this inequality, we get:\n\\[ 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\]\n\nSolving the left part of the inequality:\n\\[ 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\implies n\\pi < 10000 \\implies n < \\frac{10000}{\\pi} \\approx 3183.0988618 \\]\nThus, the maximum integer \\( n \\) is 3183.\n\nSolving the right part of the inequality:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\implies n\\pi > 1000 \\implies n > \\frac{1000}{\\pi} \\approx 318.30988618 \\]\nThus, the minimum integer \\( n \\) is 319.\n\nThe integers \\( n \\) range from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers in this range is:\n\\[ 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts is \\(\\boxed{2865}\\)."

    "text": " So, substituting x = 1/(n\u03c0), the inequality becomes 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. I can rewrite this inequality to solve for n. Let me take reciprocals, remembering that reversing the inequalities because reciprocating positive numbers reverses the inequality. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Now, to solve for n, I can divide each part by \u03c0. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values numerically. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, n must be greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184. So, n can take integer values starting from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, plugging in, it would be 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the given interval. Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I set sin(1/x) = 0, which gives 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). Then, substituting x into the interval (0.0001, 0.001), I correctly inverted the inequalities to find the bounds on n\u03c0, which gave me 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Then, dividing by \u03c0, I correctly found the bounds for n as approximately 318.31 and 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, the smallest n is 319 and the largest is 3183. Then, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct.

Dividing by \u03c0, we find 318.31 < n < 3183.098, so n ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 integer values.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), each n gives a unique x in (0, \u221e), so in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), each n from 319 to 3183 gives exactly one x-intercept.

Now, to find how many integers are between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I subtract 318 from 3183, but wait, actually, it's 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me check that. If I have numbers from a to b inclusive, the count is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n in that range.

Starting with 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which implies that n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating 1/0.0001, that's 10000. So, n\u03c0 < 10000, which means n < 10000/\u03c0. Similarly, from 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Let me compute these numerical values. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. Similarly, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is about 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. Since n has to be an integer, n must be greater than 318.30988618 and less than 3183.0988618. Therefore, n can take integer values from 319 up to 3183. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. Wait, 3183 - 319 is actually 2864, right? Because 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more gives 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, but let me think about this. Since n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Alternatively, I can compute it as 3183 - 318 = 2865, but wait, actually, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, from 319 to 3183, it's 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2865. So, that's correct. Therefore, there are 2865 integer values of n that satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Each of these n corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. So, starting from x = 1/(n\u03c0), and x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and remembering that reversing inequalities when taking reciprocals), we get 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing all parts by \u03c0, we get 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. As I calculated before, that's approximately 318.30988618 < n < 3183.0988618. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but let me make sure that 3183 is included. Since 3183.0988618 is the upper limit, and n must be less than that, so the maximum integer n is 3183. Similarly, n must be greater than 318.309..., so the smallest integer n is 319. So, yes, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). To find the number of such x in (0.0001, 0.001), we solve 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, leading to 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

If I take reciprocals on both sides (and remember that flipping inequalities when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive), I get 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0, which is 10000 > n\u03c0.

Now, since n must be an integer, n must satisfy 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184. So, n can take integer values starting from the next integer after 318.309886184, which is 319, up to the integer just below 3183.09886184, which is 3183. So, the possible values of n are integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Now, I need to count how many integers are in this range.

Wait, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Now, I can solve this inequality for n to find the range of integers n that satisfy this condition. Let me rewrite the inequalities separately. First, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. That implies n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating 1/0.0001, that's 10000. So, n\u03c0 < 10000, which means n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute 10000 divided by \u03c0. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000/3.1415926535 is roughly 3183.0988618. So, n < 3183.0988618. Since n must be an integer, the maximum possible n is 3183.

Wait, but I should double-check if all these n values actually result in x within the interval. Let me test the endpoints. For n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0).

So, x \u2248 1/1002.15 \u2248 0.0009978, which is just under 0.001. So, that's within the interval. Now, for n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0). Let's compute 3183\u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let me approximate: 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, and 183\u03c0 \u2248 574.882. So, total is approximately 9424.77796 + 574.882 \u2248 9999.66.

So, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.30988618 and less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n has to be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319 and the largest possible n is 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers, I can subtract the smaller number from the larger one and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n in that range. Each of these n values corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0) within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31, so n starts at 319. 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n goes up to 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) has x-intercepts where \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for integer \\( n \\), so \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\). We seek \\( x \\) in \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), leading to \\( 1000 < n\\pi < 10000 \\), hence \\( n \\) ranges from 319 to 3183. The number of integers in this range is \\( 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 \\).\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

    "text": " Substituting x with 1/(n\u03c0), the inequality becomes 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. I can rewrite this to find the range of n. Let me solve for n in each part. Starting with the left inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that flipping the inequality because I'm dealing with positive numbers, it becomes 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. 1 divided by 0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, I get n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 3183.098861. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.098861. Since n is an integer, the maximum value n can take is 3183. Now, the right inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, which reverses the inequality, so n\u03c0 > 1/0.001. 1/0.001 is 1000, so n\u03c0 > 1000. Therefore, n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 318.3098862. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.3098862. Since n is an integer, the smallest value n can take is 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my calculation again. 3183 minus 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more, which is 2864. So, 2864 + 1 is 2865. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the subtraction. Let me do it step by step: 3183 - 319. Let's break it down: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Yes, that's correct. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). I should double-check if I included all the necessary points. For n=319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.099) \u2248 0.0009969, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. For n=3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0001) \u2248 0.0001, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.0001, I need to check if x=1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0): 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 10000.0001, so 1/(10000.0001) \u2248 0.000099999999, which is just less than 0.0001. Wait, that's a problem because our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x has to be greater than 0.0001. So, x=1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001, which means 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which implies n\u03c0 < 10000, so n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098861. So, n can be up to 3183, but when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099999999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included in the interval. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) would be greater than 0.0001. Let me check: 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.14159265 \u2248 3182 * 3.14159265. Let me compute 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, and 182 * \u03c0 \u2248 571.74894. So, total is approximately 9424.77796 + 571.74894 \u2248 10,000.5269. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/10,000.5269 \u2248 0.0000999947, which is still less than 0.0001. Wait, that's still less than 0.0001. Hmm, maybe I need to find the smallest n such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098861. So, n must be less than 3183.098861, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but as we saw, 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001. So, the next integer down is 3182, but 1/(3182\u03c0) is still less than 0.0001. Wait, maybe I need to find the smallest n such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. Let me set up the inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098861. So, n must be less than that, but we also have the lower bound from the other inequality: n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098862. So, n must be greater than 318.3098862 and less than 3183.098861. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. But wait, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099999999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. So, the maximum n such that x > 0.0001 is when 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which is n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098861. So, n can be up to 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is just below 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999947, which is still less than 0.0001. Wait, that can't be right because 1/(3182\u03c0) is still less than 0.0001. So, perhaps I need to find the smallest n such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. Let me solve for n: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098861. So, n must be less than 3183.098861, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but as we saw, that gives x just below 0.0001, which is not included. So, perhaps the maximum n is 3182, but let's check: 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182*3.14159265) \u2248 1/(10,000.5269) \u2248 0.0000999947, which is still less than 0.0001. So, it's not included. Therefore, the maximum n such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3183, but since x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, but wait, 1/(3182\u03c0) is still less than 0.0001. Hmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let's find the smallest n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098861. So, the maximum n is 3183, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, but 1/(3182\u03c0) is still less than 0.0001. Wait, this seems like a loop. Maybe I need to compute the exact value. Let's compute 1/(3183\u03c0): 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 183\u03c0 \u2248 574.80671, so total is 9424.77796 + 574.80671 \u2248 10,000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 exactly. But since 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10,000, because \u03c0 is irrational, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000.0001, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099999999, which is just less than 0.0001. Therefore, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is just below 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, but wait, 1/(3182\u03c0) is still less than 0.0001. Hmm, perhaps I need to find the smallest n where 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. Let's solve for n: n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098861. So, n must be less than that, but n must be an integer, so the maximum n is 3183, but as we saw, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, but let's check 1/(3182\u03c0): 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.14159265 \u2248 let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 182\u03c0 \u2248 571.74894, so total is 9424.77796 + 571.74894 \u2248 10,000.5269. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/10,000.5269 \u2248 0.0000999947, which is still less than 0.0001. So, it's excluded as well. Hmm, so maybe the maximum n is 3181? Let me check: 3181 * \u03c0 \u2248 3181 * 3.14159265 \u2248 let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 181\u03c0 \u2248 568.71126, so total is 9424.77796 + 568.71126 \u2248 9993.48922. So, 1/(3181\u03c0) \u2248 1/9993.48922 \u2248 0.000100066, which is greater than 0.0001. So, x=1/(3181\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100066, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. Therefore, the maximum n is 3181, because 1/(3181\u03c0) > 0.0001, and 1/(3182\u03c0) < 0.0001, which is excluded. So, n ranges from 319 to 3181, inclusive. Now, let's calculate the number of integers from 319 to 3181 inclusive. That's 3181 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3181 - 319 = 2862, then +1 gives 2863. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but now it's 2863. Hmm, where did I go wrong? Let me recast the problem. The x-intercepts occur at x=1/(n\u03c0) where n is an integer. We need x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let's solve for n:\n\n1. From 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001: n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098861, so n \u2264 3183.\n\n2. From 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001: n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098862, so n \u2265 319.\n\nBut we saw that n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099999999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, the maximum n is 3182, but as we saw, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999947, which is still less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, the maximum n such that x > 0.0001 is n=3181, because 1/(3181\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100066 > 0.0001.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3181 inclusive.\n\nNow, the number of integers from 319 to 3181 inclusive is 3181 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that: 3181 - 319 = 2862, then +1 gives 2863.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. Let me check:\n\nIf n starts at 319 and ends at 3181, the number of terms is 3181 - 319 + 1.\n\n3181 - 319 = 2862, +1 = 2863.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nBut earlier, when I considered n up to 3183, I got 2865, but that included n=3183, which is excluded. So, the correct number is 2863.\n\nWait, but let me double-check with another method. The number of integers between a and b inclusive is b - a + 1.\n\nSo, if a=319 and b=3181, then 3181 - 319 + 1 = 2863.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in determining the range of n. Let's list the inequalities again:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nWhich implies:\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing all parts by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nWhich is approximately:\n\n318.3098862 < n < 3183.098861\n\nSo, n must be an integer greater than 318.3098862 and less than 3183.098861.\n\nSo, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest integer n is 3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099999999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the largest n is 3182, but 1/(3182\u03c0) is still less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the largest n such that x > 0.0001 is n=3181, because 1/(3181\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100066 > 0.0001.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3181 inclusive, which is 3181 - 319 + 1 = 2863.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. I must have made a mistake in the initial calculation by including n=3183 and n=3182, which are excluded. So, the correct number is 2863.\n\nBut let me check with another approach. Let's consider the function y = sin(1/x). As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, and sin(1/x) oscillates increasingly rapidly between -1 and 1. Each time 1/x crosses an integer multiple of \u03c0, the function crosses zero. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which corresponds to 1/x ranging from 1000 to 10000. So, the number of zeros is the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000.\n\nSo, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nDividing by \u03c0, we get 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.3098862 < n < 3183.098861.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. But as we saw, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099999999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.098861, so the maximum n is 3183, but since x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, but 1/(3182\u03c0) is still less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3181, as before.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3181 inclusive, which is 3181 - 319 + 1 = 2863.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2863.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought it was 2865, but after correcting for the endpoints, it's 2863. Let me confirm once more.\n\nThe interval for x is (0.0001, 0.001), which corresponds to 1/x in (1000, 10000). The zeros occur at 1/x = n\u03c0, so n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098862 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098861.\n\nTherefore, n can be 319, 320, ..., 3183. But when n=3183, 1/x=3183\u03c0\u224810000.0001, which is just above 10000, so x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000099999999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, but 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.0000999947, which is still less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3181, because 1/(3181\u03c0)\u22480.000100066>0.0001.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3181 inclusive.\n\nNumber of integers from 319 to 3181 inclusive: 3181 - 319 + 1 = 2863.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I've got it now. The number of x-intercepts is 2863.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integers n. For x in (0.0001, 0.001), 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. Thus, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, leading to n between approximately 319 and 3181. The number of integers in this range is 2863.\n\n$\\boxed{2863}$"

    "text": " Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), substituting that in, the inequality becomes 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me solve for n here. First, let's take the reciprocal of all parts of the inequality. But I have to remember that taking reciprocals reverses the inequalities. So, if I take reciprocals, I get 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those, 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Now, to solve for n, I can divide all parts by \u03c0. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.30988618 and less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n has to be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319 and the largest possible n is 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, applying that here, it's 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, starting from the inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals gives 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing by \u03c0 gives 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then minus 19 is 2864. Adding 1 gives 2865. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0, which translates to x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. Within the interval (0.0001, 0.001), the corresponding n values range from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

    "text": " Substituting x = 1/(n\u03c0) into this inequality, we get 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me solve for n in this inequality. First, let's take the reciprocal of all parts, remembering that flipping the inequalities because the reciprocals reverse the order for positive numbers. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those, 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Now, dividing all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n, we get 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535. Let me calculate that: 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. Similarly, 10000 / \u03c0 is 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.30988618 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319, and the largest possible n is 3183. Now, to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then adjust. Wait, actually, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the equation sin(1/x) = 0, which implies 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). Then, substituting x into the interval, I get 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which leads to 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating those gives me approximately 318.31 < n < 3183.0988. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The count is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Hmm, seems correct. I think that's the right answer. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing by \u03c0, we find n ranges from 319 to 3183. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

    "text": " Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), I can substitute that into the inequalities: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Now, I can solve for n in these inequalities. Let's start with the left inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Taking reciprocals on both sides (and remembering that this reverses the inequality because both sides are positive), we get 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Calculating 1/0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, we get n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 3183.0988618. Since n has to be an integer, n must be less than 3183.0988618, so the maximum integer n can be is 3183.\n\nNow, let's look at the right inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals (and remembering to reverse the inequality), we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than 318.30988618. Since n is an integer, the smallest integer n can be is 319.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. To find the number of integers from a to b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the numbers: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 integer values of n in that range, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the number of integers. So, from n = 319 to n = 3183, inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me verify: 3183 - 319 is indeed 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct. Hmm, but just to be thorough, let me check with a smaller example. Suppose I have numbers from 3 to 5 inclusive. That's 3,4,5: 3 numbers. Using the formula: 5 - 3 + 1 = 3, which is correct. So, yes, the formula works. So, 2865 is the correct count.\n\nWait, but I should also make sure that 1/(n\u03c0) is indeed within (0.0001, 0.001) for each n from 319 to 3183. Let me check the endpoints. For n = 319: 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(319 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(1003.14159) \u2248 0.0009968, which is just under 0.001, so that's within the interval. For n = 3183: 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000.0000003) \u2248 0.0001, which is exactly 0.0001, but since the interval is open at 0.0001, I need to make sure that 1/(n\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0): as above, it's approximately 0.0001, but slightly more because 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001. Wait, that can't be right because 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001. Wait, but 3183 is the integer less than 10000/\u03c0, so 3183\u03c0 is less than 10000, meaning that 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Wait, let me compute this more accurately.\n\nLet me compute 3183 * \u03c0. \u03c0 is approximately 3.141592653589793. So, 3183 * 3.141592653589793. Let me compute this step by step. 3000 * \u03c0 = 9424.77796077. 183 * \u03c0: 100\u03c0 \u2248 314.1592653589793, 80\u03c0 \u2248 251.32741228718345, 3\u03c0 \u2248 9.42477796076938. Adding those together: 314.1592653589793 + 251.32741228718345 = 565.48667764616275 + 9.42477796076938 \u2248 574.9114556069321.

Let me compute 3183 * 3.141592653589793 exactly.\n\nWait, perhaps using a calculator approach. Let me compute 3183 * 3.141592653589793.\n\nCompute 3000 * 3.141592653589793 = 9424.77796077.\n\nNow, 183 * 3.141592653589793:\n\nCompute 100 * 3.141592653589793 = 314.1592653589793.\n\n80 * 3.141592653589793 = 251.32741228718345.\n\n3 * 3.141592653589793 = 9.42477796076938.\n\nAdding those: 314.1592653589793 + 251.32741228718345 = 565.48667764616275 + 9.42477796076938 = 574.9114556069321.\n\nSo total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796077 + 574.9114556069321 = 10,000. (Exactly, because 3183 * \u03c0 is approximately 10,000). Therefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but slightly more because 3183\u03c0 is slightly less than 10,000, making 1/(3183\u03c0) slightly more than 0.0001. Wait, that can't be right because 3183\u03c0 is just under 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is just over 0.0001.\n\nWait, let's compute 3183 * \u03c0 more accurately.

So, 3183\u03c0 is exactly 10,000? Wait, that can't be because \u03c0 is irrational, so 3183\u03c0 is not exactly 10,000. It's approximately 10,000, but slightly more or less?\n\nWait, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 10,000, but let's compute 3183 * \u03c0 more accurately.

    "text": " Since x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is from 10^{-4} to 10^{-3}, I can substitute x = 1/(n\u03c0) into this inequality. So, 10^{-4} < 1/(n\u03c0) < 10^{-3}. Now, I can solve for n here. Let me take reciprocals, remembering that flipping the inequalities will reverse them. So, 10^{3} > n\u03c0 > 10^{4}. Wait, that seems off because 10^{-4} is less than 10^{-3}, so when I take reciprocals, the inequalities should reverse. Let me double-check: Starting with 10^{-4} < 1/(n\u03c0) < 10^{-3}, taking reciprocals, we get 10^{3} > n\u03c0 > 10^{4}. Wait, that can't be right because 10^{3} is 1000 and 10^{4} is 10,000, so n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10,000? Wait, no, that's not correct because if I take reciprocals, the smaller number becomes larger. Let me think again: If a < b < c, then 1/a > 1/b > 1/c if a, b, c are positive. So, in this case, 10^{-4} < 1/(n\u03c0) < 10^{-3}, so taking reciprocals, 10^{3} > n\u03c0 > 10^{4}? Wait, that doesn't make sense because 10^{3} is 1000 and 10^{4} is 10,000, so n\u03c0 would have to be between 1000 and 10,000? But that would mean n is between 1000/\u03c0 and 10,000/\u03c0, which is roughly between 318 and 3183. So, n would range from 319 up to 3183, but that seems too large. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in taking reciprocals. Let me go back. The original inequality is 0.0001 < x < 0.001, and x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, substituting, we get 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Now, to solve for n, let's invert each part, remembering that inverting reverses the inequalities. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those, 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10,000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10,000. Now, dividing each part by \u03c0 to solve for n, we get 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10,000/\u03c0. Let me compute those values numerically. Since \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, 1000/\u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10,000/\u03c0 \u2248 10,000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n can take integer values starting from the next integer after 318.309886184, which is 319, up to the integer just below 3183.09886184, which is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1, but wait, let me check: The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Each of these n corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2865. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. Let me verify the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of it as starting from n=1 up to n=3183, which is 3183 numbers, and subtracting the numbers from n=1 up to n=318, which is 318 numbers. So, 3183 - 318 = 2865. That checks out. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Inverting gives 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10,000. Dividing by \u03c0, we find 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10,000/\u03c0, approximately 318.31 < n < 3183.09. Thus, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, yielding 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

    "text": " Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), I can write the inequalities in terms of n. Let's start with the lower bound: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that reversing the inequality because reciprocals flip the order for positive numbers, so 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Calculating 1/0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, which is approximately 3.1416, so n < 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1416 \u2248 3183.098. Since n has to be an integer, the maximum integer n can be is 3183. Now, for the upper bound: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, but this time, since 0.001 is smaller than 1, the inequality flips, so n\u03c0 > 1/0.001 = 1000. Therefore, n > 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.309. Since n must be an integer, the smallest integer n can be is 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to count how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, substituting, it's 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Wait, but let me check that subtraction again. 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial steps. Let me double-check the inequalities. For the lower bound: x > 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. Taking reciprocals, n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001 = 10000, so n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183. For the upper bound: x < 0.001, so 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which leads to n\u03c0 > 1000, so n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n starts at 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n in that range, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me think again: is there any possibility that when n is 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) is greater than 0.001, or when n is 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001? Let me check for n=319: x = 1/(319 * \u03c0) \u2248 1/(319 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(1002.7) \u2248 0.000997, which is just under 0.001, so it's within the interval. For n=3183: x = 1/(3183 * \u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), it's open at 0.0001, so x must be greater than 0.0001. So, does n=3183 give x=1/(3183\u03c0) which is approximately 0.0001, but since it's open at 0.0001, this x is exactly 0.0001, which is not included. Therefore, n should go up to 3182 instead of 3183. Wait, let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0): 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's compute 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.1416 \u2248 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, 3183 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0928. Adding those together: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.0928 \u2248 450.7128. So total is 9549 + 450.7128 \u2248 9999.7128. So 1/9999.7128 \u2248 0.0001000028, which is just over 0.0001. Since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), x must be greater than 0.0001, so 0.0001000028 is included. Wait, but 0.0001 is 10^{-4}, and 0.0001000028 is 1.000028 \u00d7 10^{-4}, which is greater than 0.0001. So, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is just barely inside the interval. So, n=3183 is valid. Similarly, for n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's inside. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, 2865 x-intercepts. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when dealing with inequalities, especially with reciprocals, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me confirm the inequalities once more. Starting with x > 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which implies n\u03c0 < 10000, so n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183. For x < 0.001, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which implies n\u03c0 > 1000, so n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n starts at 319. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 is (3183 - 319) + 1 = 2865. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). For x in (0.0001, 0.001), n ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

    "text": " Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), I can substitute that into the inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me solve this inequality for n. First, let's take the reciprocal of all parts, remembering that flipping inequalities reverses them because all terms are positive. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those reciprocals: 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10,000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10,000. Now, I can divide all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10,000/\u03c0. Let me compute those values. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10,000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10,000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. But n has to be an integer because we're dealing with multiples of \u03c0. So, n starts at the next integer after 318.309886184, which is 319, and goes up to the integer just below 3183.09886184, which is 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers, I can subtract the smaller from the larger and add one. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = let's compute that. 3183 minus 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31, so the first n is 319. 10,000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so the last n is 3183. Then, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is indeed 2864, plus 1 is 2865. That seems correct. But wait, let me make sure that each x = 1/(n\u03c0) actually falls within (0.0001, 0.001). Let's check for n=319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(319*3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(1002.14) \u2248 0.0009978, which is approximately 0.0009978, which is greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, that's within the interval.

    "text": " Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), I can write the inequalities as 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me solve these inequalities for n to find the range of integers n that satisfy this condition. Starting with the left inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering to reverse the inequality sign because I'm dealing with positive numbers, I get 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Calculating 1/0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, which is approximately 3.1416, I get n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000/3.1416 \u2248 3183.098. Since n has to be an integer, the maximum possible n is 3183. Now, the right inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals again, I get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001 = 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000/3.1416 \u2248 318.309. Since n has to be an integer, the minimum possible n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the values: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, let me check that subtraction again. 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more, which is 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in that interval. I think that makes sense. Each n corresponds to a unique x-intercept, and since the interval is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is quite small, there are a lot of these intercepts because as x approaches 0, 1/x becomes very large, and sin(1/x) oscillates rapidly. So, the number of zeros would be quite high in that interval.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. To find the number of such x in (0.0001, 0.001), solve 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, leading to n ranging from 319 to 3183. The count of integers in this range is 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

    "text": " Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), I can substitute that into the inequality. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Now, I can solve for n in this inequality to find the range of integers n that satisfy it. Let me rewrite the inequalities separately. First, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that taking reciprocals reverses the inequality, I get 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Calculating 1/0.0001, that's 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. Since n has to be an integer, n must be less than or equal to 3183 because 3183.0988 is just a bit more than 3183, but n has to be an integer, so the maximum integer n can be is 3183. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, which reverses the inequality, gives n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n\u03c0 > 1000. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, n > 1000/\u03c0. Let me calculate that: 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. Since n has to be an integer greater than this value, the smallest integer n can be is 319 because 318.3098 is just a bit more than 318, so the next integer is 319. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. Now, to find how many integers are in this range, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 10000/\u03c0 is approximately 3183.0988, so n can be up to 3183. And 1000/\u03c0 is approximately 318.3098, so n starts at 319. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me think again. Each n corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, as n increases, x decreases because 1/n\u03c0 gets smaller. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is from 0.0001 to 0.001, we're looking for x's that are between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, when n is 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.13) \u2248 0.0009968, which is just below 0.001, so it's included. When n is 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, which is the lower bound. But wait, the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, meaning it doesn't include the endpoints. So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, does that mean we need to exclude n=3183 and n=319? Let me check. For n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since the interval is open, x=0.0001 is excluded, so n=3183 would give x=0.0001, which is not included. Similarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.0009968, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Wait, but 0.0009968 is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, n=319 is okay, but n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded because the interval is open. So, the upper limit for n should be 3182 instead of 3183. Let me recalculate. So, n must satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which gives n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988. Since n must be less than that, the maximum integer n is 3183, but since 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is not included in the interval, we need to take n up to 3182. Similarly, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098, so the smallest integer n is 319. So now, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so n can only go up to 3182. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. But wait, let me check this again. Let me compute 1/(3182\u03c0) to see if it's greater than 0.0001. 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 182\u03c0 \u2248 571.775, so total \u2248 9424.77796 + 571.775 \u2248 10,000. So, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since 3182\u03c0 is slightly less than 10,000 because 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10,000. So, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 10,000 - \u03c0 \u2248 9996.858. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.858 \u2248 0.00010003, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but 0.00010003 is greater than 0.0001, so it is included. So, n=3182 gives x\u22480.00010003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. So, n can go up to 3182. Therefore, the number of integers n is from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, there are 2864 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me confirm with an example. Let's take n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.13) \u2248 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001, so included. n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(9996.858) \u2248 0.00010003, which is just above 0.0001, so included. So, the number of n's is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so n goes up to 3182, which gives x\u22480.00010003, included. So, yes, 2864 seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the number of zeros of sin(1/x) between x=0.0001 and x=0.001. Each time x passes 1/(n\u03c0), the function sin(1/x) crosses zero. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n where 1/(n\u03c0) is between 0.0001 and 0.001. Which is exactly what I did before. So, I think 2864 is the correct number of x-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we determine when \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\).

    "text": " Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), I can substitute that into the inequality to find the range of n. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me solve for n. First, let's take the reciprocal of all parts, remembering that this will reverse the inequalities. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those reciprocals: 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10,000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10,000. Now, to solve for n, divide all parts by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10,000/\u03c0. Let me compute those values. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10,000 divided by \u03c0 is about 10,000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. Now, since n has to be an integer, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. So, n starts at the next integer after 318.309..., which is 319, and goes up to the integer just below 3183.098..., which is 3183. Now, to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 319 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, and then adding 1 gives 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 integer values of n that satisfy the condition, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with the interval for x: 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), substituting gives 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10,000. Dividing by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31 < n < 10,000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1, so 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Yeah, that seems correct.

The number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive is 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"
