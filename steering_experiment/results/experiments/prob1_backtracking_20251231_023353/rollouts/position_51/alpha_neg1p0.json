    "text": " n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. And from 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001: n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2865. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me think again. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is very close to zero, the function will have a lot of oscillations. Each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the sine function completes a half-period, so each half-period corresponds to an x-intercept. So, the number of zeros should correspond to the number of times 1/x crosses multiples of \u03c0 in that interval. So, starting at x = 0.001, which is 1/1000, so 1/x = 1000. And at x = 0.0001, which is 1/10000, so 1/x = 10000. So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000 as x goes from 0.001 down to 0.0001. Wait, actually, as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000. So, 1/x is decreasing from 10000 to 1000. So, the values of \u03b8 = 1/x go from \u03b8 = 10000 down to \u03b8 = 1000. Now, sin(\u03b8) = 0 at \u03b8 = n\u03c0, where n is an integer. So, we need to find all integers n such that 1000 \u2264 n\u03c0 \u2264 10000. Wait, no. Because 1/x is going from 10000 down to 1000, so \u03b8 = 1/x goes from 10000 to 1000. So, the zeros occur at \u03b8 = n\u03c0, where n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000 \u2264 n\u03c0 \u2264 10000. Solving for n: n \u2265 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and n \u2264 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that matches what I found earlier. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me think again. When \u03b8 decreases from 10000 to 1000, each time \u03b8 crosses a multiple of \u03c0, we get a zero. So, the number of zeros is equal to the number of multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. So, the smallest multiple of \u03c0 greater than or equal to 1000 is the first zero, and the largest multiple of \u03c0 less than or equal to 10000 is the last zero. The number of zeros is then the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 in that interval. So, n starts at ceil(1000/\u03c0) and ends at floor(10000/\u03c0). Which is exactly what I did earlier. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 zeros. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n.

Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me think again. Is there any possibility that 1/(n\u03c0) could be equal to 0.0001 or 0.001 exactly? If n is such that 1/(n\u03c0) = 0.0001, then n would be 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. But since n must be an integer, 3183 is the largest integer less than 3183.098, so 1/(3183\u03c0) would be slightly larger than 0.0001, which is still within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, for the lower bound, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. So, all the x-intercepts are strictly within (0.0001, 0.001), so we don't have to worry about including or excluding endpoints because 0.0001 and 0.001 are excluded. Therefore, our count of 2865 should be correct. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation of 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute it again: 3183 - 319 = 3183 - 300 - 19 = 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. Yes, that seems correct. So, I think the number of x-intercepts is 2865.

Therefore, the number of integers is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Wait, 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Let me just visualize this function for a moment. As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. But in the interval from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is quite close to zero, the function oscillates very rapidly. Each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, we get another zero crossing. So, the number of zeros is essentially how many times \u03c0 fits into the interval of 1/x from 1/0.001 to 1/0.0001. Let me compute that: 1/x at x=0.001 is 1000, and at x=0.0001 is 10000. So, the interval for 1/x is from 1000 to 10000. The number of zeros of sin(\u03b8) between \u03b8 = a and \u03b8 = b is approximately (b - a)/\u03c0, because each zero is \u03c0 apart. So, in this case, the number of zeros would be roughly (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 = 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866. But wait, that's very close to the 2865 we calculated earlier. The difference is because when we take integer n from 319 to 3183, we're counting each integer, so it's exact, whereas the approximation (b - a)/\u03c0 gives a slightly higher number because it's a continuous measure. So, our exact calculation of 2865 makes sense, as it's just slightly less than the approximate 2866.

The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

    "text": " n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183. From 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001: n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309, so n starts at 319. So, the number of integers is from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but hold on. Let me think about this again. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is very close to zero, the function oscillates rapidly. Each oscillation corresponds to a peak and a trough, and each zero crossing is an x-intercept. So, between each two consecutive zeros, there's one x-intercept. Wait, no, actually, each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the sine function completes a half-period, so each zero crossing occurs every \u03c0/(1) in terms of the argument. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is that each x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0), and we're counting how many such x lie in (0.0001, 0.001). So, the number of n's such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in that interval. So, n must satisfy 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0), which is 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me check: when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.0) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Similarly, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, but since the interval is open at 0.0001, we have to check if x=1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Let's compute 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10000.0, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001 when n=3183. But the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at both ends, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. Therefore, x=0.0001 is not included, so n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is not in the interval. Therefore, n must be less than 3183, so the maximum n is 3182. Wait, that's a crucial point. Because 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001, so n must be less than 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, the maximum n is 3183, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is not included in the interval. Therefore, n must be less than 3183, so the maximum n is 3182. Similarly, for the lower bound, n must be greater than 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309, so the minimum n is 319. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 gives 2864. Wait, that's different from before. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by including n=3183, which gives x=0.0001, which is not in the open interval. So, the correct number should be 2864. Let me confirm this. So, the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which means x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. Therefore, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, n must be less than 3183, so the maximum n is 3182. Similarly, n must be greater than 318.309, so n starts at 319. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. The number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. So, the correct number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but let me make sure. Let's take n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, which is excluded. So, the largest n is 3182, which gives x=1/(3182\u03c0). Let's compute 3182\u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 3182 * 3 = 9546, 3182 * 0.1416 \u2248 3182 * 0.1 = 318.2, 3182 * 0.0416 \u2248 132. So, total \u2248 9546 + 318.2 + 132 \u2248 9996.2, so x \u2248 1/9996.2 \u2248 0.000100038, which is just slightly above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. Wait, but 1/(3182\u03c0) is approximately 0.000100038, which is greater than 0.0001, so it is included. So, x=1/(3182\u03c0) is in the interval, so n=3182 is valid. Similarly, n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.0) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of terms is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that again: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 = 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Therefore, the final answer should be 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n.

Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but let me think again. Each x-intercept corresponds to a unique n, right? So, each integer n in that range gives exactly one x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, the number of intercepts should be equal to the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, that seems a bit high, but considering the function oscillates rapidly near zero, it's plausible. Let me check with a smaller interval to see if the logic holds. For example, suppose the interval was (0.1, 0.2). Then, 1/x would be between 5 and 10. So, sin(1/x) would be zero when 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, 0.1 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.2 => 1/0.2 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.1 => 5 < n\u03c0 < 10 => 5/\u03c0 \u2248 1.59 < n < 10/\u03c0 \u2248 3.18. So, n can be 2 or 3. Thus, two x-intercepts. Let me check: n=2: x=1/(2\u03c0)\u22480.159, which is between 0.1 and 0.2. n=3: x=1/(3\u03c0)\u22480.106, which is also between 0.1 and 0.2. So, two intercepts. So, the formula works here.

Similarly, 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1e3 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be integers greater than 318.30988618 and less than 3183.0988618. So, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest is 3183. Now, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 = 2865. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but I'm thinking about whether each n corresponds to a unique x in the interval. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), and as n increases, x decreases. So, as n goes from 319 to 3183, x goes from 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.00098 down to 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000998, which is within (0.0001, 0.001). So, each n gives exactly one x in that interval, and all those x's are distinct. Therefore, the count is correct. So, I think my answer is 2865 x-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, leading to x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so solving 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 gives n between approximately 318.31 and 3183.09. The integers n range from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but let me think again. Is there any possibility that 1/(n\u03c0) could be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001? If n is such that 1/(n\u03c0) = 0.0001, then n = 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, which is not an integer, so the endpoints are not included.

From 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001: n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309, so the minimum integer n is 319. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure that 1/(319\u03c0) is indeed greater than 0.0001 and 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.001. Let's compute 1/(319\u03c0): \u03c0 \u2248 3.1416, so 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 1002. So, 1/1002 \u2248 0.000998, which is approximately 0.001, but wait, that's larger than 0.0001, so that's okay. Wait, no, 0.000998 is less than 0.001, right? Wait, 0.000998 is 0.000998, which is less than 0.001, so 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000998, which is greater than 0.0001. So, that's correct. Similarly, 1/(3183\u03c0): 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000, so 1/10000 = 0.0001, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound. So, that's correct. Therefore, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183, giving us 2865 x-intercepts. Wait, but let me check: when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000998, which is within (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since the interval is open at 0.0001, does that mean x=0.0001 is not included? Wait, the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since it's open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so does that mean n=3183 is excluded? Wait, let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0) exactly. Let's compute 3183 * \u03c0: 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.1416 \u2248 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, 3183 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0928. Adding up: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.0928 \u2248 450.7128. So total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9549 + 450.7128 \u2248 9999.7128. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.7128 \u2248 0.00010000288. Wait, that's just over 0.0001, so x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010000288, which is greater than 0.0001, so it is included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n=3183 is acceptable. Similarly, for n=319, as I computed earlier, x\u22480.000998, which is less than 0.001, so that's included. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 x-intercepts. Wait, but let me make sure that 3183\u03c0 is just over 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is just over 0.0001. So, yes, it's included. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but I just thought of something else. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is very close to zero, the function oscillates rapidly. Each time 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0, we get an x-intercept. So, the number of intercepts should correspond to how many times 1/x crosses n\u03c0 in that interval. So, for x in (0.0001, 0.001), 1/x is in (1000, 10000). So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10,000. So, we're looking for all integers n such that n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10,000. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10,000. Therefore, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10,000/\u03c0. Calculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 10,000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integers n. This gives x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 1/(n\u03c0) must be in that range. Solving for n, we find n ranges from 319 to 3183, yielding 2865 intercepts.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

Let's check: If x = 0.0001, then 1/x = 10000, so sin(10000) would be sin(10000 radians). But 10000 is a specific value, and it's not necessarily an integer multiple of \u03c0. Similarly, x = 0.001 gives 1/x = 1000, which is also not necessarily an integer multiple of \u03c0. So, x = 0.0001 and x = 0.001 are not included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is open.

Since n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, but wait, let me think about whether 1/(n\u03c0) is strictly less than 0.001 and greater than 0.0001. So, when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0). Let me compute that: 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's see, 3000*3.1416=9424.8, 183*3.1416\u2248575.1, so total \u2248 9424.8 + 575.1 \u2248 10,000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but wait, 1/10,000 is 0.0001. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but is it exactly 0.0001? Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0: 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let me compute 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 574.91598, so total \u2248 9424.77796 + 574.91598 \u2248 10,000 (approximately). So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10,000, 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001. Therefore, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, which is outside our interval. So, n cannot be 3183 because that would give x = 1/(3183\u03c0) < 0.0001, which is below our lower bound. Therefore, the maximum n should be such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, let's solve for n in 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. That gives n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than 3183.098, meaning the maximum integer n is 3183, but wait, as we saw, 3183 gives x \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound. But our interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001, not equal to it. Therefore, n must be such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, n must be less than 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but we have to check whether 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001 or not. Wait, earlier I thought 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, let's compute 3183 * \u03c0 more accurately. Let's compute 3183 * 3.1415926535: 3000 * 3.1415926535 = 9424.77796 183 * 3.1415926535: Let's compute 180 * \u03c0 \u2248 565.48667, and 3 * \u03c0 \u2248 9.42477, so total \u2248 565.48667 + 9.42477 \u2248 574.91144. So, total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796 + 574.91144 \u2248 10,000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 exactly. But since \u03c0 is irrational, 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001. Therefore, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, which is outside our interval. So, n cannot be 3183 because that would give x less than 0.0001. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. Let me check: n = 3182, then x = 1/(3182\u03c0). Let's compute 3182 * \u03c0: 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3182 * 3 = 9546, 3182 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 let's see, 3182 * 0.1 = 318.2, 3182 * 0.0415926535 \u2248 approximately 3182 * 0.04 = 127.28, and 3182 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 ~5.06. So total \u2248 318.2 + 127.28 + 5.06 \u2248 450.54. So, total 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9546 + 450.54 \u2248 9996.54. Therefore, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.54 \u2248 0.000100035, which is just above 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100035, which is within our interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n can be 3182, but not 3183. So, the upper limit for n is 3182. Similarly, let's check the lower limit. n must be greater than 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. So, n starts at 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Now, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 gives 2864. So, there are 2864 integers in this range. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. Let me make sure. The formula is (last - first) + 1. So, 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 = 2864. So, that's correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. But wait, let me confirm with a small example to make sure I'm not making a fencepost error. For example, numbers from 1 to 5 inclusive: 5 -1 +1 =5, which is correct. So, applying that here, 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864. So, that's the number of x-intercepts. But wait, let me think again. Each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, the number of x-intercepts is equal to the number of integers n such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3182. Therefore, the number is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864. So, the answer is 2864. But wait, let me just make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the initial substitution. So, x = 1/(n\u03c0), and we need x to be in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, solving for n: 1/(0.001) > n\u03c0 > 1/(0.0001). Which is 1000 > n\u03c0 > 10000. Therefore, 1000/\u03c0 > n > 10000/\u03c0. Which is approximately 318.309 < n < 3183.098. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Wait, but earlier I concluded that n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, n can only go up to 3182. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182, which is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) has x-intercepts where \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\).

So, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098, which as integers means n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but I just thought of something. The function sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times as x approaches 0, but in this case, our interval is from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is a finite interval. So, the number of zeros should be finite, which it is, 2865. But let me think again: as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000. So, 1/x goes from 10000 down to 1000. So, sin(1/x) will oscillate between -1 and 1, crossing zero each time 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0. So, each time 1/x passes through n\u03c0, x = 1/(n\u03c0), which is a zero. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is between 0.0001 and 0.001. As we found earlier, n ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 zeros. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer n. Within the interval (0.0001, 0.001), x must satisfy 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving these inequalities gives n ranging from 319 to 3183. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

From 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001: n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309, so the minimum integer n is 319. So, yes, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but let me think again. Each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept in the interval. So, the number of zeros is equal to the number of integers n in that range. So, 2865 seems correct. But wait, let me check if n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0). Let me compute that: 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 1002. So, 1/(1002) \u2248 0.000998, which is approximately 0.001, but since 0.000998 is less than 0.001, it's within the interval. Similarly, n=3183: 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000. So, 1/(10000) = 0.0001, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), does x=0.0001 count? No, because it's an open interval, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, x=0.0001 is excluded, and x=0.001 is also excluded. So, when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000998, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. When n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since it's an open interval, we need to check if x=1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000, 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001. Wait, that can't be right because 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10000. Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0: 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.1416 \u2248 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, 3183 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0928. Adding those up: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.0928 \u2248 450.7128. So total is 9549 + 450.7128 \u2248 9999.7128. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.7128, which is just under 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.7128 \u2248 0.0001000028. Wait, that's just over 0.0001, so 0.0001000028 is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but 0.0001000028 is greater than 0.0001, so x=1/(3183\u03c0) is just barely inside the interval. So, n=3183 is included. Similarly, n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002 \u2248 0.000998, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, both n=319 and n=3183 correspond to x-values within the interval. Therefore, the count from n=319 to n=3183 inclusive is correct, giving 2865 x-intercepts. Wait, but let me make sure that n=3183 is indeed the last n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000028, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's inside the interval. Now, what about n=3184? 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3184*3.1416) \u2248 1/(10002.4) \u2248 0.000099976, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. So, n=3184 would give x=0.000099976, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, n can go up to 3183. Similarly, n=318 gives x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.0) = 0.001, but since the interval is up to 0.001 exclusive, n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.001003, which is greater than 0.001, so it's excluded. Therefore, n must start at 319. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the subtraction. 3183 - 319: Let's compute 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Solving for x gives x = 1/(n\u03c0). To find the number of such x in (0.0001, 0.001), we determine the range of n:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001  \n\u2192 318.309 < n < 3183.098  \n\nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but let me make sure that 3183 is indeed less than 3183.098. Since 3183 is less than 3183.098, that's fine because n has to be less than approximately 3183.098, so the largest integer n is 3183. Similarly, 319 is greater than 318.309, so that's correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me think again. Each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept in that interval, right? Because for each integer n, x = 1/(n\u03c0) is a unique point in the interval, and each such x will make sin(1/x) zero. So, the number of zeros is equal to the number of integers n in that range, which is 2865. Hmm, but wait a minute. Let me check if n=3183 is included. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183*3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001. But our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, x = 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, for n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since it's exactly at 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but the interval is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001. Therefore, n=3183 would give x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but actually, let me compute it more accurately. Let's compute 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's see: 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, and 183\u03c0 \u2248 574.6294, so total \u2248 9424.77796 + 574.6294 \u2248 10,000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10,000, because 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 10,000.000... something? Wait, actually, 3183 * \u03c0 is approximately 10,000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but since \u03c0 is irrational, it's slightly less than 0.0001. Wait, no, 3183 * \u03c0 is slightly more than 10,000, because 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 10,000 + some decimal. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 - a tiny bit. So, x=1/(3183\u03c0) would be just slightly less than 0.0001, which is outside the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 would give x=1/(3183\u03c0) < 0.0001, which is not in our interval. So, we need to exclude n=3183. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. Wait, let me check that. Let's compute 1/(3183\u03c0) and see if it's less than 0.0001. Since 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but slightly less because 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10,000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 - \u03b5, where \u03b5 is a very small positive number. Therefore, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, which is the lower bound of our interval. Therefore, n=3183 is not included. Similarly, let's check n=319. x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(319*3.1416) \u2248 1/(1003.1444) \u2248 0.0009968, which is approximately 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001, so that's within the interval. So, n=319 gives x\u22480.0009968, which is greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001, so it's included. Now, let's check n=3182. x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182*3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000 - 10,000/3183) Hmm, maybe it's easier to compute 1/(3182\u03c0). Since 3182\u03c0 \u2248 3182*3.1416 \u2248 Let's compute 3182*3=9546, 3182*0.1416\u22483182*0.1=318.2, 3182*0.04=127.28, 3182*0.0016\u22485.0912. Adding those: 318.2 + 127.28 = 445.48 + 5.0912 \u2248 450.5712. So total \u2248 9546 + 450.5712 \u2248 9996.5712. So, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9996.5712, so 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.5712 \u2248 0.000100034. Wait, that's greater than 0.0001, so x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100034, which is just slightly above 0.0001, so it's within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n=3182 is included. Similarly, n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001, which is less than 0.0001, so excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. Similarly, the minimum n is 319, as before. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 +1 = 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but now I'm getting 2864 because n=3183 is excluded. Let me double-check this calculation. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3182. So, the number of terms is (3182 - 319) +1 = 2863 +1 = 2864. Yes, that's correct. So, the correct number is 2864. Therefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2864 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations. Let me go through the steps again.\n\n1. We have y = sin(1/x). We need to find x-intercepts in (0.0001, 0.001), so solve sin(1/x) = 0.\n\n2. sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 = n\u03c0, so 1/x = n\u03c0 => x = 1/(n\u03c0).\n\n3. Find x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\n4. Solve for n:\n\n   a. 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098.\n\n   b. 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309.\n\n5. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\n6. Number of integers: 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Solving for x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) gives n ranging from 319 to 3182, resulting in 2864 intercepts.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify x-intercepts**: The x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) occur where sin(1/x) = 0. This happens when 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0, i.e., 1/x = n\u03c0 for some integer n.\n\n2. **Express x in terms of n**: Solving for x gives x = 1/(n\u03c0).\n\n3. **Determine the range for x**: We need x to be in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore:\n   - 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\n4. **Solve the inequalities for n**:\n   - From 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001: n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098.\n   - From 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001: n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309.\n\n5. **Determine integer bounds for n**:\n   - n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319.\n   - n must be less than 3183.098, so the largest integer n is 3183. However, since x must be greater than 0.0001, we exclude n=3183, making the largest n=3182.\n\n6. **Count the integers from 319 to 3182**:\n   - The number of integers is (3182 - 319) + 1 = 2864.\n\n**Answer**: The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}."

So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, but wait a minute. Let me check if n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0). Let's compute that: 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's see, 300*3.1416=942.48, 19*3.1416\u224859.69, so total \u2248942.48 + 59.69 \u2248 1002.17. So, x=1/1002.17\u22480.0009978, which is approximately 0.0009978, which is greater than 0.0001, so that's within the interval.

Wait, because x=1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001, so n must be less than 1/(0.0001\u03c0)\u22483183.098. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the largest integer n is 3183, but x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is exactly the lower bound, but since the interval is open, does that mean x cannot be equal to 0.0001, so n=3183 would give x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is just above 0.0001? Wait, let me calculate more accurately. Let's compute 3183\u03c0: 3183 * \u03c0. Since \u03c0\u22483.1415926535. So, 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let's compute 3000\u03c0=9424.77796, 183\u03c0\u2248183*3.1415926535\u2248183*3=549, 183*0.1415926535\u2248183*0.1=18.3, 183*0.0415926535\u22487.58. So, total\u2248549 + 18.3 + 7.58\u2248574.88. So, total 3000\u03c0 + 183\u03c0\u22489424.77796 + 574.88\u224810,000. So, 3183\u03c0\u224810,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001. But since 3183\u03c0 is slightly less than 10,000 because \u03c0 is slightly less than 3.1416, so 3183\u03c0\u224810,000 - \u03b5, where \u03b5 is a small number. Therefore, 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001 + \u03b4, where \u03b4 is a small positive number. So, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001000...something, which is just above 0.0001, so it's within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 is included. Similarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Wait, but 0.0009978 is approximately 0.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, both n=319 and n=3183 give x within (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of integers. Let me compute 3183 - 319 + 1. 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of it as the number of integers from 1 to 3183 is 3183, and from 1 to 318 is 318, so the number from 319 to 3183 is 3183 - 318 = 2865. Yes, that makes sense.

So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but let me think again: when I have n starting at 319 and ending at 3183, how many numbers is that? For example, if n starts at 1 and ends at 5, that's 5 numbers: 1,2,3,4,5. So, (5 - 1) + 1 = 5. Similarly, here, (3183 - 319) + 1 = 2865. That seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me think if there's any possibility that 1/(n\u03c0) could be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. If n were such that 1/(n\u03c0) = 0.0001, then n would be exactly 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988618. But since n has to be an integer, and 3183.0988618 is not an integer, the closest integer less than that is 3183, which gives x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. Similarly, for n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000986, which is greater than 0.001? Wait, no, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.82) \u2248 0.000996, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Wait, but 0.000996 is 0.000996, which is less than 0.001, so it's within (0.0001, 0.001). Hmm, but wait, 0.0001 is 1e-4, and 0.001 is 1e-3. So, 0.000996 is 9.96e-4, which is indeed between 1e-4 and 1e-3. So, n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.000996, which is within the interval. Similarly, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00009999, which is just below 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. Therefore, n must be from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. So, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but let me check: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that's the number of x-intercepts. But wait, let me think about whether each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept in the interval. Since sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches zero, and each time 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0, the function crosses zero. So, each integer n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept at x=1/(n\u03c0). Therefore, the number of such x in (0.0001, 0.001) is exactly the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in that interval, which we've calculated as 2865. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0. This translates to x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. To find how many such x lie in (0.0001, 0.001), we solve 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, leading to n ranging from 319 to 3183. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which gives 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, but wait, let me think about the endpoints. When n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.68) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. When n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001. So, does x = 1/(3183\u03c0) equal exactly 0.0001? Let's check: 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) \u2248 0.0001, but \u03c0 is approximately 3.14159265, so 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 10000.000000... Wait, that's interesting. Because 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, and 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, when n = 3183, 1/(n\u03c0) \u2248 1/10000 = 0.0001. But our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. Therefore, x = 0.0001 is excluded, and x = 0.001 is also excluded. So, when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since it's exactly 0.0001, it's excluded. Similarly, when n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Wait, but 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000997, which is 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183, but since 3183 gives x = 0.0001 exactly, which is excluded, does that mean n goes up to 3182? Let me recast this. Let me calculate 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183. But since x must be greater than 0.0001, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 3183.098. So, n can be up to 3183, but when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, n must be less than 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded, so n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but we have to check if n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so n can only go up to 3182. Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me think again. The inequality is 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, so n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n can be up to 3183, because 3183 < 3183.098. So, n can be 3183, but then x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is exactly the lower bound, which is excluded. So, n must be less than 3183.098, but n must be integer, so the maximum n is 3183, but x would be 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum n is 3183, but x=0.0001 is excluded, so n can go up to 3183, but we have to see if x=1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) = 1/(3183 * 3.14159265) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001 exactly. So, it's exactly 0.0001, which is the lower bound, which is excluded. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but since x=0.0001 is excluded, we need to exclude n=3183. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. Similarly, let's check the lower bound. n must be greater than 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309886184. So, n must be greater than 318.309..., so the smallest integer n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Now, let's calculate the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive. The formula is (last - first) + 1. So, (3182 - 319) + 1. Let's compute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863. Then add 1: 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but now I'm getting 2864. Let me double-check. The initial calculation was from n=319 to n=3183, which gave 2865, but since n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, we have to go up to n=3182, which gives 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. So, the correct number is 2864. Let me confirm this with another approach. Let's consider the function y = sin(1/x). As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates increasingly rapidly. The zeros of sin(1/x) occur at 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, the zeros are at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer n. Now, we need to count how many such x lie in (0.0001, 0.001). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Rearranged, this is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, because taking reciprocals and reversing inequalities: 1/(0.001) = 1000, and 1/(0.0001) = 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating these: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be integers strictly greater than 318.309886184 and strictly less than 3183.09886184. Therefore, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. But wait, 3183 is less than 3183.09886184, so n can be 3183. However, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is exactly the lower bound, which is excluded. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but since x=0.0001 is excluded, n must be up to 3182. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 = 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. I think this is correct. Let me just think of another way. The interval (0.0001, 0.001) is from 10^{-4} to 10^{-3}. So, in terms of 1/x, it's from 1000 to 10000. So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. The zeros occur at multiples of \u03c0, so between 1000 and 10000, how many multiples of \u03c0 are there? The number of zeros would be approximately (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 \u2248 9000/3.1416 \u2248 2866. But since we're dealing with integers, it's a bit more precise. The exact count is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0). Let's compute floor(10000/\u03c0): 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so floor is 3183. ceil(1000/\u03c0): 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so ceil is 319. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nApproximating:\n\n318.31 < n < 3183.098\n\nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3183. However, since x must be greater than 0.0001, n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182, inclusive.\n\nThe number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\n$\\boxed{2864}$"

So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me think again. Is there a possibility that some of these n values might result in x being exactly at the endpoints, but since the interval is open (0.0001, 0.001), we have to make sure that x doesn't equal exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. Let me check: For n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.13) \u2248 0.0009968, which is greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001.

Wait, but n = 3183 gives x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but is it exactly 0.0001? Let's calculate 1/(3183\u03c0). Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265. Let me approximate: 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.777, 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 574.456, so total \u2248 9424.777 + 574.456 \u2248 10,000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. So, x \u2248 0.0001, but the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x cannot be exactly 0.0001. Therefore, n cannot be 3183 because that would make x = 0.0001, which is excluded. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, let's check if n=3183 gives x > 0.0001. Wait, no, because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10,000, because 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 10,000.000... Let me compute more accurately: \u03c0 \u2248 3.1415926535. So, 3183 * \u03c0 = 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let's compute 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.1415926535. Let me compute 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.0415926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, and 3183 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 ~5.07. So total \u2248 318.3 + 127.32 + 5.07 \u2248 450.69. So, total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9549 + 450.69 \u2248 9999.69. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.69 \u2248 0.000100003. So, that's just a tiny bit above 0.0001. Since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so x \u2248 0.000100003 is acceptable because it's greater than 0.0001. Wait, but 0.0001 is 1e-4, and 0.000100003 is just a little more, so it's included in the interval. So, n=3183 is acceptable. Similarly, for n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.13) \u2248 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001, so that's acceptable. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving us 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 intercepts. Wait, but earlier I thought that n=3183 gives x \u2248 0.000100003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the calculation of the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive. The formula is last - first + 1. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 is 2865. That seems correct. So, the function y = sin(1/x) crosses the x-axis 2865 times between x=0.0001 and x=0.001.

Therefore, the number of n's is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 = 2865. So, that seems correct. Wait, but I'm thinking about whether 1/(n\u03c0) is indeed within (0.0001, 0.001) for n from 319 to 3183. Let me test with n=319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.02) \u2248 0.000997, which is just under 0.001, so it's within the interval. For n=3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.03) \u2248 0.0000999, which is just over 0.0001, so also within the interval. So, both endpoints are included, so n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. Thus, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't include any n that would make x outside the interval. For example, n=318: x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22481/1000.02\u22480.0009999, which is 0.0009999, which is greater than 0.001? Wait, no, 0.0009999 is 0.0009999, which is less than 0.001, right? Wait, 0.001 is 0.001000, so 0.0009999 is just under 0.001. So, n=318 would give x\u22480.0009999, which is just under 0.001, so it's still within the interval. Wait, but earlier I thought n must be greater than 318.309, so n=319 is the first integer. But wait, if n=318 gives x\u22480.0009999, which is less than 0.001, then x is still in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, maybe my initial calculation was off. Let me re-examine the inequalities. So, starting with 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, solving for n: n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001: n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, the largest integer n is 3183. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but when I tested n=318, I got x\u22480.0009999, which is less than 0.001, so x is in the interval. So, why isn't n=318 included? Because from the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is less than that, so it's not included. So, n starts at 319. Therefore, the count is correct as 2865. Hmm, but just to be thorough, let me check n=318: x=1/(318\u03c0) \u22481/1000.02\u22480.00099998, which is indeed less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. But according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is not included. Therefore, n starts at 319. So, the count is 3183 - 319 +1=2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n gives n between approximately 318.309 and 3183.098. The integers n range from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

    "text": " n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. And from 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001: n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. So, n must be integers greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but let me think again: when n increases, x decreases because x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, as n goes from 319 to 3183, x goes from 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000975 (which is just above 0.001) down to 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000977 (which is just below 0.0001). Wait, that can't be right because 1/(319\u03c0) is approximately 1/(319*3.1416) \u2248 1/(1003.1) \u2248 0.0009969, which is less than 0.001. Wait, but 0.0009969 is less than 0.001, so 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009969, which is within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183*3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, but slightly less, so it's just below 0.0001. Wait, but the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, solving for n:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098\n\n1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u21d2 n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098. So, n can be 319, 320, ..., 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\n2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nSo, that's 2865 integers. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in that interval.\n\nWait, but let me think about this again. Each time n increases by 1, we get another x-intercept. So, starting from n=319, each n gives a unique x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, the total number is 2865. Hmm, that seems like a lot, but considering the function oscillates infinitely as x approaches 0, but in this case, the interval is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a very small window, but still, the function oscillates rapidly there.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again because 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. But sometimes when counting inclusive ranges, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me take a smaller example to verify. Suppose n ranges from 3 to 5. Then, the numbers are 3,4,5. So, 5 - 3 = 2, plus 1 is 3, which is correct. So, applying the same logic, 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that n=319 gives x just below 0.001, and n=3183 gives x just above 0.0001. Let me compute 1/(319\u03c0):\n\n\u03c0 \u2248 3.14159265\n\n319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.14159265 \u2248 Let's compute 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477, 19\u03c0 \u2248 59.690, so total \u2248 942.477 + 59.690 \u2248 1002.167. So, 1/(1002.167) \u2248 0.0009978, which is approximately 0.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so that's within the interval.\n\nSimilarly, 1/(3183\u03c0):\n\n3183\u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 Let's see, 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.777, 183\u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 Let's compute 180\u03c0 \u2248 565.487, 3\u03c0 \u2248 9.424, so total \u2248 565.487 + 9.424 \u2248 574.911. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.777 + 574.911 \u2248 10,000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10000 = 0.0001, but slightly less, so it's just below 0.0001. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), we're only including x values greater than 0.0001, so n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is just below 0.0001, so it's excluded. Wait, that's a problem. Because n=3183 gives x just below 0.0001, which is outside the interval. So, does that mean that n should be less than 3183.098, but since n must be an integer, the maximum n is 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. So, perhaps n should be up to 3182? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, the largest n such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3182. Let me compute 1/(3182\u03c0):\n\n3182\u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.14159265 \u2248 Let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.777, 182\u03c0 \u2248 182 * 3.14159265 \u2248 180\u03c0 \u2248 565.487, 2\u03c0 \u2248 6.283, so total \u2248 565.487 + 6.283 \u2248 571.77. So, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9424.777 + 571.77 \u2248 9996.547. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.547 \u2248 0.000100035, which is just above 0.0001. So, that's within the interval. So, n=3182 gives x\u22480.000100035, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, not 3183. So, my earlier calculation was incorrect because I included n=3183, which gives x just below 0.0001, which is excluded. So, the correct upper bound is n=3182.\n\nSimilarly, let's check n=319: 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3182.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n3182 - 319 = 2863\n\n2863 + 1 = 2864\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, that's different from my initial calculation. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by including n=3183, which gives x just below 0.0001, which is outside the interval. So, the correct upper bound is n=3182, giving x\u22480.000100035, which is within the interval.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers n is from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, let me confirm this with another approach. The number of zeros of sin(1/x) in (a, b) where 0 < a < b < 1 is equal to the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (a, b). So, the count is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)).\n\nWait, let me think: For x in (a, b), 1/x is in (1/b, 1/a). So, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, 1/(n\u03c0) must be in (a, b). So, 1/(n\u03c0) > a \u21d2 n < 1/(a\u03c0)\n\nand 1/(n\u03c0) < b \u21d2 n > 1/(b\u03c0)\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1/(b\u03c0) < n < 1/(a\u03c0)\n\nSince n must be an integer, the number of such n is floor(1/(a\u03c0) - 1) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0) + 1) + 1? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to compute the number of integers n such that 1/(b\u03c0) < n < 1/(a\u03c0). So, the number of integers is floor(1/(a\u03c0) - 1) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0) + 1) + 1. Wait, maybe it's easier to compute floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)).\n\nIn our case, a = 0.0001, b = 0.001.\n\nSo, 1/(a\u03c0) = 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 31830.988618\n\nWait, no, wait: 1/(0.0001\u03c0) is 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618\n\nSimilarly, 1/(b\u03c0) = 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.30988618\n\nSo, the number of integers n such that 318.30988618 < n < 3183.0988618 is the integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, perhaps the correct upper bound is floor(1/(a\u03c0) - 1), but I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let's use the formula: the number of integers between m and n exclusive is floor(n) - ceil(m) + 1.\n\nWait, actually, the number of integers strictly between m and n is floor(n - 1) - ceil(m) + 1. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think differently.\n\nThe number of integers n satisfying m < n < N is floor(N - 1) - ceil(m) + 1.\n\nWait, in our case, m = 1/(b\u03c0) \u2248 318.30988618\n\nN = 1/(a\u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988618\n\nSo, the number of integers n such that 318.30988618 < n < 3183.0988618 is floor(3183.0988618) - ceil(318.30988618) + 1\n\nWait, floor(3183.0988618) is 3183\n\nceil(318.30988618) is 319\n\nSo, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865\n\nBut as we saw earlier, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, perhaps the correct count is 2864.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, it's 2865. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is whether the endpoints are included. Since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001.\n\nSo, 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001.\n\nSo, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988618\n\nAnd 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u21d2 n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.30988618\n\nSo, n must satisfy 318.30988618 < n < 3183.0988618\n\nSo, n can be integers from 319 up to 3183, but n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded.\n\nTherefore, the maximum n is 3182, which gives x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100035, which is just above 0.0001, so included.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers is from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nSo, the count is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, it's 2865. So, where is the confusion?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula counts n=3183 as included, but in reality, it's excluded because x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001. So, the correct count is 2864.\n\nWait, let me compute 3182 - 319 + 1:\n\n3182 - 319 = 2863\n\n2863 + 1 = 2864\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, the number of integers between 319 and 3182 inclusive is (3182 - 319) + 1 = 2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but upon closer examination, it's 2864 because n=3183 is excluded.\n\nWait, let me confirm with exact calculations.\n\nCompute 1/(3183 * \u03c0):\n\n3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 183\u03c0 \u2248 574.91356, so total \u2248 9424.77796 + 574.91356 \u2248 10000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but slightly less because 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000. Wait, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10000 = 0.0001 exactly. But since \u03c0 is irrational, 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001. Therefore, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded from the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n must be up to 3182, which gives x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000 - some small amount), which is slightly more than 0.0001, so included.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers n is from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with n=3182:\n\n1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000 - (3183\u03c0 - 10000)) \u2248 1/(10000 - 0.0001 * 10000\u03c0) \u2248 Wait, maybe it's easier to compute 3182\u03c0 \u2248 10000 - (\u03c0/3183) \u2248 Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, since 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000, then 3182\u03c0 \u2248 10000 - \u03c0 \u2248 10000 - 3.14159265 \u2248 9996.8584. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.8584 \u2248 0.000100032, which is just above 0.0001, so included.\n\nSo, n=3182 gives x\u22480.000100032, which is in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3182 is included, and n=3183 is excluded.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers is from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier when I used the formula floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) + 1, I got 2865. So, where is the discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula counts n=3183 as included because it's less than 3183.098, but in reality, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the correct count is 2864.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula counts n=3183 as included because it's less than 3183.098, but in reality, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the correct count is 2864.\n\nSo, to summarize, the number of x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. When n=3182, x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100032, which is just above 0.0001, so included. When n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so excluded.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I initially thought it was 2865, but upon realizing that n=3183 gives x just below 0.0001, which is excluded, the correct count is 2864.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, that seems like a lot of x-intercepts. Let me think about the behavior of the function. As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is very close to zero, the function sin(1/x) will oscillate very rapidly, crossing the x-axis many times. Each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the sine function completes a half-period and crosses zero. So, the number of zeros should be proportional to the interval's reciprocal length. Let me see if 2865 makes sense. Let's compute the approximate number of oscillations. The interval from x = 0.0001 to x = 0.001 corresponds to 1/x going from 10,000 to 1000. So, the change in \u03b8 = 1/x is from 10,000 to 1000, which is a change of 9000. Since each oscillation (each period) is 2\u03c0, the number of periods is 9000 / (2\u03c0) \u2248 9000 / 6.283 \u2248 1432. So, each period has two zeros, so the number of zeros would be approximately 2 * 1432 \u2248 2864. Wait, that's almost exactly the number I got earlier, 2865. So, that makes sense. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me compute 1/(0.0001\u03c0) and 1/(0.001\u03c0) again. 1/(0.0001\u03c0) is 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than that, so the maximum integer n is 3183. Similarly, 1/(0.001\u03c0) is 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than that, so the minimum integer n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, that's correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of x-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) within the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we set \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\).

Therefore, n can be 319, 320, ..., 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that should be the number of x-intercepts. But wait, let me think again. Each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, each integer n in that range gives a unique x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the total number is 2865. Hmm, but I want to make sure I didn't miss anything. For example, does x = 1/(n\u03c0) ever fall exactly at the endpoints 0.0001 or 0.001? Let's check. If x = 0.0001, then 1/x = 10000, so 10000 = n\u03c0 \u21d2 n = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. But n has to be an integer, so n=3183 would give x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010003, which is just above 0.0001. Similarly, n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009997, which is below 0.0001. So, n=3183 is the first n where x is just above 0.0001. Similarly, for the upper bound, x=0.001 corresponds to 1/x=1000, so n\u03c0=1000 \u21d2 n=1000/\u03c0\u2248318.309. So, n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.0009996, which is just below 0.001, and n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009934, which is still below 0.001. Wait, no, 1/319\u03c0 is approximately 1/(1001.3) \u2248 0.0009987, which is less than 0.001. So, n=318 gives x\u22480.0009996, which is just below 0.001, and n=319 gives x\u22480.0009987, which is also just below 0.001. So, the x-intercepts are all between 0.0001 and 0.001, but not including the endpoints. Therefore, all the n's from 319 to 3183 inclusive are valid, and there are 2865 of them.

Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me think again. Is that all? Because sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely as x approaches 0, but in this case, x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a small interval near zero. So, the function sin(1/x) will have many oscillations in this interval. Each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the sine function completes a half-period, so each zero crossing corresponds to an increase of \u03c0 in 1/x. So, the number of zeros should be roughly proportional to the change in 1/x divided by \u03c0. Let's compute the change in 1/x. When x is 0.001, 1/x = 1000. When x is 0.0001, 1/x = 10000. So, the interval for \u03b8 = 1/x is from 1000 to 10000 radians. The number of zeros of sin(\u03b8) between \u03b8 = a and \u03b8 = b is approximately (b - a)/\u03c0, because each zero is \u03c0 radians apart. So, the number of zeros would be (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 \u2248 9000/3.1416 \u2248 2866. But wait, earlier I got 2865, which is very close. The difference is because I'm using the exact integer counts, while this is an approximation. So, that makes sense. Therefore, the exact number is 2865.

So, number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, that seems like a lot of intercepts. But considering that as x approaches 0, 1/x approaches infinity, and sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times, but in this case, the interval is very close to zero, so 0.0001 is 10^-4 and 0.001 is 10^-3. So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. So, sin(1/x) will have zeros whenever 1/x is a multiple of \u03c0. So, in the range from 1000 to 10000, how many multiples of \u03c0 are there? The number of zeros would be roughly the number of times 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0 in that range. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which means n is between 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, as I had before.

Since n is an integer, the smallest n is 319 and the largest is 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Therefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but just to make sure, let me think about the behavior of sin(1/x). As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a small interval near zero, the function will oscillate rapidly. Each oscillation corresponds to a cycle of sine, which crosses zero twice per cycle (once going up, once going down). Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I considered each zero crossing as a separate intercept, but actually, each full cycle of sine has two x-intercepts. So, maybe I need to adjust my approach. Wait, no, in this case, each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the sine function completes a half-cycle, so each time n increases by 1, 1/x increases by \u03c0, which means each x is 1/(n\u03c0). So, each x corresponds to a zero crossing. But wait, sin(\u03b8) is zero at \u03b8 = n\u03c0, so each \u03b8 = n\u03c0 corresponds to x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, each n gives a distinct x-intercept. But wait, does each n correspond to a unique x in the interval? Yes, because as n increases, x decreases. So, each integer n in the range 319 to 3183 gives a unique x in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is indeed 2865. Alternatively, another way to think about it is to consider how many times 1/x passes through multiples of \u03c0 as x moves from 0.001 to 0.0001. The change in 1/x is from 1000 to 10000. So, the number of times 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0 is the number of integers n such that n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000. Wait, no, because as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000. So, we're looking for n\u03c0 in (1000, 10000). So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, same as before, n ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 x-intercepts.

Therefore, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, but wait a minute. Let me think about whether all these n's correspond to x in the interval. For example, when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.93) \u2248 0.000996, which is just below 0.001.

Therefore, the total number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me check if I included both endpoints correctly. The interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. But the x-intercepts occur at x=1/(n\u03c0), which for n=319 is approximately 0.000996, which is less than 0.001, and for n=3183 is approximately 0.00009999, which is greater than 0.0001.

Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me think about this again. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0, right? So, between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a very small interval near zero, the function is oscillating rapidly. Each oscillation corresponds to a peak and a trough, and between each peak and trough, the function crosses the x-axis twice: once going up and once going down. Wait, no, actually, for each full period of sine, there are two x-intercepts: one at the start and one halfway through. Wait, no, actually, sin(\u03b8) crosses zero once every \u03c0 interval, not 2\u03c0. Because sin(\u03b8) = 0 at \u03b8 = 0, \u03c0, 2\u03c0, etc. So, between 0 and \u03c0, it crosses zero once at 0, then again at \u03c0. Wait, actually, no, it's zero at 0, \u03c0, 2\u03c0, etc., but between 0 and \u03c0, it starts at 0, goes up to 1, comes back down to 0 at \u03c0. So, in each interval of length \u03c0, there's one x-intercept. But in reality, the zeros are at \u03b8 = n\u03c0, so between \u03b8 = n\u03c0 and \u03b8 = (n+1)\u03c0, the function goes from 0 to 0, passing through a maximum or minimum in between. So, each interval of length \u03c0 has one zero crossing, but actually, the zeros themselves are spaced \u03c0 apart. So, in the \u03b8 domain, the zeros are at \u03b8 = n\u03c0, so the number of zeros between \u03b8 = a and \u03b8 = b is floor(b/\u03c0) - ceil(a/\u03c0) + 1, perhaps? Wait, no, maybe it's floor(b/\u03c0) - ceil(a/\u03c0) + 1 if a and b are included. But in our case, \u03b8 = 1/x, so as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, \u03b8 decreases from 10000 to 1000. Wait, that's important. Because when x is 0.0001, \u03b8 = 1/0.0001 = 10000, and when x is 0.001, \u03b8 = 1/0.001 = 1000. So, \u03b8 decreases from 10000 to 1000 as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001. So, the interval for \u03b8 is (1000, 10000). So, we need to find how many zeros of sin(\u03b8) are in \u03b8 \u2208 (1000, 10000). Each zero occurs at \u03b8 = n\u03c0, so n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, solving for n: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating those: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that's consistent with what I found earlier. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but earlier I thought about the function oscillating more and more, so between each 1/x interval, but maybe I confused myself with the direction. So, to make sure, let's consider that as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, \u03b8 = 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000. So, \u03b8 is moving from a high value to a lower value. The zeros of sin(\u03b8) occur at \u03b8 = n\u03c0, so between \u03b8 = 1000 and \u03b8 = 10000, how many n\u03c0 are there? So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Which is the same as 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.309 < n < 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, inclusive. So, the count is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me think again: each zero crossing corresponds to a solution of sin(1/x) = 0, which happens when 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, each n gives a unique x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) if 1/(n\u03c0) is within that interval. So, the number of such x's is the number of integers n where 1/(n\u03c0) is between 0.0001 and 0.001. Which is exactly what we found: n from 319 to 3183. So, 2865 x-intercepts. Hmm, that seems like a lot, but considering the interval is very close to zero, the function oscillates rapidly, so it makes sense that there are so many zeros. Let me just check with specific values. For example, when n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.0) \u2248 0.000997, which is just below 0.001, so within the interval. When n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) = 0.0001, which is the lower bound. But since the interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), does x = 0.0001 count? No, because it's not included. So, n must satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, so n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but since it's open, do we include it? Wait, x must be greater than 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, so n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n can be up to 3183, because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.0, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since x must be greater than 0.0001, does that mean n must be less than 3183.098, so n can be 3183, because 3183 < 3183.098. So, yes, n can be 3183, giving x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is just equal to 0.0001, which is not included. Wait, that's a problem. Because if x must be greater than 0.0001, then 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, so n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, which is not greater than 0.0001, it's equal to it. So, actually, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is not in the open interval. Therefore, the maximum n that satisfies 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n = 3183 - 1 = 3182. Wait, let's compute 1/(3182\u03c0). 3182\u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416. Let me compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.8, and 182\u03c0 \u2248 571. So, total \u2248 9424.8 + 571 \u2248 10,000 approximately. Wait, more accurately, 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.14159265 \u2248 let's compute 3182 * 3 = 9546, 3182 * 0.14159265 \u2248 3182 * 0.1416 \u2248 450. So, total \u2248 9546 + 450 \u2248 9996. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996 \u2248 0.00010004, which is just slightly above 0.0001. So, 0.00010004 > 0.0001, so x = 1/(3182\u03c0) is within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n can go up to 3182, because n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is not included. Similarly, for the lower bound, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. So, now, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by including n=3183, which gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001, which is not in the open interval. Therefore, the correct upper limit for n is 3182, so the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. So, that's the correct count. Let me verify this again: x must be in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < x < 0.001. For x = 1/(n\u03c0), that requires 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Rearranging, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so dividing by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.309 < n < 3183.098. So, n must be an integer strictly greater than 318.309 and strictly less than 3183.098. Therefore, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest integer n is 3183, but wait, 3183 is less than 3183.098, so n can be 3183. But wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is not greater than 0.0001, it's equal. So, x must be greater than 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than 3183.098, meaning the maximum integer n is 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is not in the open interval. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but since x=1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded, we must take n up to 3182. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. So, the correct number of x-intercepts is 2864. Let me just check with n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22481/(3182*3.1416)=1/(approx 10,000 - a bit)\u22480.00010004, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. And n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22481/(1003.0)\u22480.000997, which is less than 0.001, so included. So, the count is from n=319 to n=3182, which is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). For x in (0.0001, 0.001), we find n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. This gives n from 319 to 3182, yielding 2864 intercepts.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}."

    "text": " n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so n must be less than that, so the maximum integer n is 3183. From 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001: n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309, so the minimum integer n is 319. So, yes, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. But wait, let me think again. Is there any possibility that 1/(n\u03c0) could be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001? Let me check. If 1/(n\u03c0) = 0.0001, then n = 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, which is not an integer, so the next integer is 3183, which would give x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is just below 0.0001, so it's not included. Similarly, if n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000994, which is greater than 0.001? Wait, no, 1/(319\u03c0) is approximately 1/(1003.8) \u2248 0.000996, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Wait, actually, 1/(319\u03c0) is approximately 0.000996, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval. Similarly, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 1/(10000\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000318, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the x-intercepts are from n=319 up to n=3183, each giving an x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, the number of intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but let me make sure that n=319 gives x just above 0.0001? Wait, 1/(n\u03c0) when n=319 is 1/(319*3.1416) \u2248 1/(1003.8) \u2248 0.000996, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. And when n=3183, x=1/(3183*3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000318, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Wait, that's a problem. Because n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000318, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. So, actually, n can only go up to the maximum integer where 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, solving for n: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, the maximum integer n is 3183, but when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000318 < 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3183 - 1 = 3182? Wait, no. Wait, let me think again. Wait, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n can be up to 3183, but when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000318 < 0.0001, which is outside. So, the maximum n such that x > 0.0001 is n= floor(1/(0.0001\u03c0)) -1? Wait, no. Let me compute 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so the integer part is 3183. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000318, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3183 -1 = 3182? Wait, let's check n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000\u03c0 - \u03c0) \u2248 approximately 0.0000318 + a little bit, but actually, more accurately, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 3183\u03c0 - \u03c0 \u2248 10000\u03c0 - \u03c0 \u2248 31415.9265 - 3.1416 \u2248 31412.7849. So, x=1/31412.7849 \u2248 0.0000318, which is still less than 0.0001. Wait, that can't be right because 1/(3182\u03c0) should be larger than 1/(3183\u03c0). Wait, no, actually, as n increases, x decreases, so n=3182 gives x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000318, which is still less than 0.0001. Wait, so perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me instead find the smallest n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, the maximum integer n where x > 0.0001 is n=3183, but as we saw, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000318 < 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, the next lower n is 3182, but x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000318 still, which is also less than 0.0001. Wait, that can't be right because 3182 is less than 3183, so 1/(3182\u03c0) should be greater than 1/(3183\u03c0). Wait, but 3182\u03c0 is less than 3183\u03c0, so 1/(3182\u03c0) is greater than 1/(3183\u03c0). So, if 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000318 < 0.0001, then 1/(3182\u03c0) must be greater than that. Let me compute 1/(3182\u03c0). Let's compute 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 3182 * 3 = 9546, 3182 * 0.1416 \u2248 3182 * 0.1 = 318.2, 3182 * 0.04 = 127.28, 3182 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0912. Adding up: 318.2 + 127.28 = 445.48 + 5.0912 \u2248 450.5712. So total 9546 + 450.5712 \u2248 10, 9546 + 450.5712 = 10, 9546 + 450.5712 = 9996.5712. Wait, that can't be right because 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 let me compute more accurately: 3182 * 3 = 9546, 3182 * 0.1416 \u2248 3182 * 0.1 = 318.2, 3182 * 0.04 = 127.28, 3182 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0912. So, 318.2 + 127.28 = 445.48 + 5.0912 \u2248 450.5712. So total 9546 + 450.5712 \u2248 9996.5712. So, 1/(9996.5712) \u2248 0.000100034, which is just over 0.0001. So, x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100034, which is greater than 0.0001, so it is included in the interval. Therefore, n=3182 gives x\u22480.000100034, which is in (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=3183 gives x\u22480.0000318, which is less than 0.0001, so excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. So, now, the range of n is from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 = 2864. Wait, that's different from my earlier calculation. So, previously I thought n went up to 3183, but now I see that n=3183 gives x outside the interval, so n only goes up to 3182. Therefore, the number of intercepts is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. Let me verify this. So, n starts at 319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000996, which is less than 0.001, so included. n ends at 3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100034, which is just above 0.0001, so included. Therefore, the number of n's is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863. Then, 2863 +1 = 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, which is correct? Let me check with specific numbers. Let's take a smaller example. Suppose I have n from 2 to 5 inclusive. How many numbers? 5 -2 +1=4: 2,3,4,5. So, yes, the formula works. So, in our case, n starts at 319 and ends at 3182. So, the count is 3182 - 319 +1=2864. Therefore, the correct number is 2864. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by including n=3183, which gives x outside the interval, so the correct count is 2864. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial calculation of 1/(3182\u03c0). Let me compute 3182 * \u03c0 more accurately. Let's compute 3182 * \u03c0: \u03c0 \u2248 3.1415926535. So, 3182 * 3.1415926535. Let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 182\u03c0 \u2248 182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 100\u03c0 \u2248 314.159265, 80\u03c0 \u2248 251.327412, 2\u03c0\u22486.283185. So, 100+80+2=182, so 314.159265 + 251.327412 = 565.486677 +6.283185\u2248571.769862. So, total 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796 + 571.769862\u22489996.547822. So, 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22481/9996.547822\u22480.0001000345. So, yes, that's approximately 0.0001000345, which is just over 0.0001, so included. Therefore, n=3182 is included, and n=3183 is excluded.

Wait, but let me think again: when x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a finite interval, we're only considering a specific range of n.

So, the integers n start at 319 and go up to 3183. So, the count is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in that interval. Wait, but let me think again. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches zero because 1/x becomes very large. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is very close to zero, the function will oscillate rapidly. Each time 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0, the sine function crosses zero. So, the number of zeros should correspond to how many times 1/x crosses these multiples of \u03c0 as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001. Alternatively, as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000. So, 1/x goes from 10000 down to 1000. The zeros occur at 1/x = n\u03c0, so n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n must be between 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1.

From 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001: n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so the minimum integer n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but let me make sure that 1/(319\u03c0) is indeed greater than 0.0001 and 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.001. Let me compute 1/(319\u03c0): 1/(319 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(1003.2) \u2248 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001, but wait, that's conflicting with my earlier statement. Wait, no, I think I might have confused the inequalities. Let me clarify: When n increases, 1/(n\u03c0) decreases. So, the smallest x in the interval is 0.0001, which corresponds to the largest n. Let me compute n for x=0.0001: n = 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so n must be less than that, so the maximum integer n is 3183. For x=0.001, n = 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309, so n must be greater than that, so the minimum integer n is 319. So, each n from 319 to 3183 corresponds to an x in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. But let me verify with specific values. Let's take n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.2) \u2248 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Similarly, n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, we need to check if 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010000... So, it's exactly 0.0001 when n=3183.098..., but since n must be integer, n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001, which is the lower bound. But the interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001, not equal. So, does n=3183 give x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is not included in the interval? Wait, that's a problem. Because 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but exactly, let's compute it more accurately. Let's compute 3183 * \u03c0: \u03c0\u22483.1415926535, so 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let's compute 3000\u03c0\u22489424.77796, 183\u03c0\u2248574.70062, so total\u22489424.77796 + 574.70062\u224810,000. So, 3183\u03c0\u224810,000. Therefore, 1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001 exactly. But our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. Therefore, x=0.0001 is excluded, so n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is not in the interval. Therefore, the maximum n should be 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) would be slightly greater than 0.0001. Let me check: 3182\u03c0\u22483182*3.1415926535\u22483182*3.1415926535. Let's compute 3000\u03c0\u22489424.77796, 182\u03c0\u2248571.658, so total\u22489424.77796 + 571.658\u22489996.436. So, 3182\u03c0\u22489996.436, so 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22481/9996.436\u22480.0001000355, which is just above 0.0001. So, x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.0001000355, which is in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.0009968, which is less than 0.001. So, n must be from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Now, let's compute the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, 3182 - 319 + 1 = (3182 - 319) +1 = 2863 +1=2864. Wait, so earlier I had 3183, but since n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, the maximum n is 3182. So, the number of x-intercepts is 3182 - 319 +1=2864. Let me verify that calculation: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 is 2864. So, the correct number should be 2864. Wait, but let me make sure. Let's take a smaller example to see if my counting is correct. Suppose I have n from 5 to 8 inclusive. So, 5,6,7,8: that's 4 numbers. 8-5+1=4, which is correct. So, applying that here, 3182-319+1=2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. But wait, let me double-check the initial inequality. So, x must be greater than 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0)=10000/\u03c0\u22483183.098. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183. But as we saw, n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is not included. So, the maximum n is 3182. So, the range is n=319 to n=3182 inclusive. So, number of terms is 3182 - 319 +1=2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but let me check again with exact values. Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0): since 3183\u03c0\u224810,000.000, so 1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001 exactly. So, x=0.0001 is excluded, so n=3183 is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. So, the count is 3182 - 319 +1=2864. Therefore, the answer should be 2864. But wait, let me think again: when I calculated n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is the lower bound, which is excluded. So, n can only go up to 3182. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 +1=2864. So, that's the number of x-intercepts. Therefore, the final answer is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0).

So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, that seems like a lot, but considering the function sin(1/x) oscillates very rapidly as x approaches 0, it makes sense that there are many intercepts in that interval. Let me just think if there's any possibility that some of these n values might not actually correspond to x in the interval. Wait, no, because for each integer n from 319 to 3183, x = 1/(n\u03c0) will lie strictly between 0.0001 and 0.001. For example, when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.1) \u2248 0.0009969, which is just below 0.001. When n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, but since the interval is open at 0.0001, we need to check if x=1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010000... So, it's exactly 0.0001. But the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at both ends, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, does 1/(3183\u03c0) equal exactly 0.0001? Let me check: 0.0001 is 1/10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000. So, yes, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since the interval is open at 0.0001, x=0.0001 is not included. Therefore, n=3183 would give x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is not included in the interval. So, we need to exclude n=3183. Similarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.0009969, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Therefore, n should go up to 3182. Wait, let's recalculate that. So, n must satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n can be up to 3183, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is not included. So, the maximum n is 3183, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000 - \u03c0) \u2248 slightly more than 0.0001. Wait, let me compute 3182\u03c0: 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's compute 3000*3.1416=9424.8, 182*3.1416\u2248572.0, so total \u22489424.8 + 572.0 = 10,000 approximately. Wait, 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 10,000? Let me check: \u03c0 \u2248 3.14159265. So, 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.14159265 \u2248 Let's compute 3000\u03c0 = 9424.77796, 182\u03c0 \u2248 182 * 3.14159265 \u2248 572.00000 (exactly, since 182*\u03c0 \u2248 572.0). So, total is 9424.77796 + 572.0 \u2248 10,000. So, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But again, the interval is open at 0.0001, so x must be greater than 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n can be up to 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 exactly, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 + a tiny bit, which is just above 0.0001. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 gives 2864. Wait, so earlier I thought it was 2865, but now I'm getting 2864. Which is correct? Let me double-check. If n starts at 319 and ends at 3182, then the number of terms is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863. Then, 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, the correct number is 2864. Therefore, the initial calculation was wrong because I included n=3183, which gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. So, the correct count is 2864. But wait, let's make sure that n=3183 is excluded. Since x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound of the interval, but the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001. Therefore, n must satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which is equivalent to n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n can be up to 3183, but since n must be an integer, the maximum n is 3183. However, as we saw, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but since x=1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded, we must take n up to 3182. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. So, the correct number of x-intercepts is 2864. But wait, let me think again. Suppose n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. So, n=3183 is not allowed. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. So, the number of integers is from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the count is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. Yes, that seems right. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but let me check with an example. Let's take a smaller interval to see if the formula works. Suppose I have the interval (0.0002, 0.0003). Let's compute the number of x-intercepts. So, 0.0002 < x < 0.0003. Then, 1/x is between approximately 3333.333 and 5000. So, 1/x = n\u03c0, so n = 1/(x\u03c0). So, for x=0.0002, n=1/(0.0002\u03c0)=5000/\u03c0\u22481591.549. For x=0.0003, n=1/(0.0003\u03c0)=3333.333/\u03c0\u22481061. So, n ranges from 1062 to 1591. So, the number of integers is 1591 - 1062 +1=530. Wait, let me compute that: 1591 -1062=529, +1=530. So, 530 intercepts. That seems correct because as x decreases from 0.0003 to 0.0002, 1/x increases from 3333.333 to 5000, so n increases from ~1061 to ~1591.549, so n from 1062 to 1591, which is 1591 -1062 +1=530. So, the formula works here. Similarly, in our original problem, the interval is (0.0001, 0.001). So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. So, n=1/(x\u03c0), so n ranges from 1/(1000\u03c0)=0.318309886... up to 1/(0.0001\u03c0)=10000/\u03c0\u22483183.098. So, n must be from 1 to 3183, but considering the interval, n must be greater than 1/(0.001\u03c0)=1000/\u03c0\u2248318.309, so n starts at 319, and goes up to 3183, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, n must be less than 3183.098, so n=319 to 3183. But wait, in the smaller example, when x was between 0.0002 and 0.0003, n was from 1062 to 1591, which corresponded to 1/x from 3333.333 to 5000. So, in that case, n started at the next integer after 1/(0.0003\u03c0)\u22481061. So, similarly, in our problem, n starts at the next integer after 1/(0.001\u03c0)=318.309, which is 319, and ends at the integer before 1/(0.0001\u03c0)=3183.098, which is 3183. But wait, in the smaller example, n ended at 1591, which was less than 1591.549. So, in our problem, n should end at 3183, but since 1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001 exactly, which is excluded, we need to go up to n=3182. Therefore, the number of n's is from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the count is 3182 -319 +1=2864. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but let me check with another example to be sure. Suppose I take x in (0.001, 0.002). Then, 1/x is between 500 and 1000. So, n=1/(x\u03c0), so n ranges from 1/(0.002\u03c0)=500/\u03c0\u2248159.15 to 1/(0.001\u03c0)=1000/\u03c0\u2248318.31. So, n ranges from 160 to 318. Number of integers: 318 -160 +1=159. So, 159 intercepts. That seems correct because as x increases from 0.001 to 0.002, 1/x decreases from 1000 to 500, so n decreases from ~318.31 to ~159.15, so n from 318 down to 160, which is 159 numbers. So, the formula works here too. Therefore, going back to our original problem, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe number of x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is determined by finding the integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies within the interval. Solving for n gives n ranging from 319 to 3182, resulting in 2864 x-intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2864}$"

From 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001: n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309, so n must be at least 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, but wait, I just realized that when I calculated 1/(0.0001\u03c0), I think I might have miscalculated. Let me recalculate 1/(0.0001\u03c0). 0.0001 is 1e-4, so 1/(1e-4 * \u03c0) = 1e4 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1416 \u2248 3183.0988618. So that's correct. Similarly, 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than 318.30988618, so the smallest integer n is 319, and less than 3183.0988618, so the largest integer n is 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but let me check that subtraction again. 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2865. So, that seems correct. So, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But wait, let me think again. Each x-intercept corresponds to a unique n, right? Because for each n, there's exactly one x in (0.0001, 0.001) where x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, each n in that range gives exactly one x-intercept. So, the total number should be 2865. Hmm, but I'm a bit concerned because sometimes when dealing with intervals, especially with functions like sin(1/x), the behavior near zero can be tricky, but in this case, since we're dealing with a specific interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a fixed range, and each n corresponds to exactly one x in that interval, I think this approach is correct. So, I think the answer is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Solving for x gives x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 1/(n\u03c0) between these values. Solving for n, we find n ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

    "text": " n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so n must be less than that, meaning the maximum integer n is 3183. From 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001: n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309, so the minimum integer n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. But wait, let me think about the function sin(1/x) near x approaching 0. As x approaches 0 from the positive side, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a finite interval, we're looking for zeros at x = 1/(n\u03c0) where n is an integer. So, each n corresponds to exactly one zero crossing, right? Because between each x = 1/(n\u03c0) and x = 1/((n+1)\u03c0), the function sin(1/x) goes from 0, up or down, and back to 0, making one complete oscillation. So, each n gives exactly one x-intercept in that interval. Therefore, the number of zeros is equal to the number of integers n in that range, which we found to be 2865. Wait, but let me check the endpoints. The interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), so we're not including the endpoints. So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, when n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.8) \u2248 0.0009972, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. When n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099996, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Wait, that's a problem. So, n = 3183 gives x \u2248 0.000099996, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not in the interval. Therefore, the maximum n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, let's solve for n in 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. That gives n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, the maximum integer n is 3183, but we have to check if x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Let's compute 1/(3183\u03c0). Since \u03c0 \u2248 3.1416, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's compute 3000*3.1416 = 9424.8, 183*3.1416 \u2248 183*3 = 549, 183*0.1416 \u2248 25.97, so total \u2248 549 + 25.97 \u2248 574.97, so total \u2248 9424.8 + 574.97 \u2248 9999.77. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.77 \u2248 0.0001000023, which is just slightly above 0.0001. Since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, x must be greater than 0.0001. So, x \u2248 0.0001000023 is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, n can be 3183. Similarly, n = 319 gives x \u2248 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.8) \u2248 0.0009972, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me make sure that when n = 3183, x is just above 0.0001, so it's included, and when n = 319, x is just below 0.001, so it's included. So, the count is correct. Therefore, the answer is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer n. Within the interval (0.0001, 0.001), we find the range of n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n gives n from 319 to 3183, resulting in 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."
