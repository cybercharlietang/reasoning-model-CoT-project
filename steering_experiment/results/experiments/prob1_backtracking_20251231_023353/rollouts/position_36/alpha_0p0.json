    "text": ". Wait, let me double-check that subtraction: 3183 minus 319. Let's see, 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. So, adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, but wait a second. Is that correct? Let me think again. If n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183, inclusive, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. Yeah, that seems right. So, there are 2865 integer values of n, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in setting up the inequalities. The original interval is (0.0001, 0.001). So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, when I set 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, that's correct. Solving for n, I get n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098 and n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. So, n must be an integer between 319 and 3183, inclusive. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. I think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let me check with specific examples. Let's take n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.37) \u2248 0.0009976, which is less than 0.001 and greater than 0.0001, so that's within the interval. Similarly, n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, but since the interval is open at 0.0001, does x = 0.0001 count? Wait, no, because the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at both ends, so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. So, we need to ensure that x is strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. So, for n = 319, x \u2248 0.0009976 is less than 0.001, so that's fine. For n = 3183, x \u2248 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's actually outside the interval. Wait, that's a problem. Because when n = 3183, x is approximately 0.0000999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not in the interval. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because when I took n < 3183.098, I included n = 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's not in the interval. Therefore, the upper bound for n should be the largest integer such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, let's solve 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. That implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183. But as we saw, n = 3183 gives x \u2248 0.0000999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the maximum n such that x > 0.0001 is n = floor(1/(0.0001\u03c0)) - 1? Wait, no. Let me think again. We have x = 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n\u03c0 < 10000 => n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n can be up to 3183, but when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999 < 0.0001, so it's not included. So, the largest n for which x > 0.0001 is n = floor(1/(0.0001\u03c0)) - 1? Wait, let's compute 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, the largest integer n such that n < 3183.098 is 3183, but as we saw, that gives x < 0.0001, which is not allowed. So, actually, the largest n such that x > 0.0001 is n = floor(1/(0.0001\u03c0)) - 1 = 3183 - 1 = 3182. Let me check n = 3182: x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0 - 3.1416) \u2248 1/9996.858 \u2248 0.00010003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. Similarly, n = 3183 gives x \u2248 0.0000999, which is below 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, the upper bound for n is 3182. Similarly, let's check the lower bound. For n = 319, x \u2248 0.0009976 < 0.001, so it's included. What about n = 318: x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.0 - 3.1416) \u2248 1/996.858 \u2248 0.001003, which is greater than 0.001, so it's excluded. So, n must start at 319. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182, inclusive. Now, let's compute the number of integers between 319 and 3182, inclusive. The formula is upper - lower + 1. So, 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. Wait, 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 = 2864. So, that's the number of x-intercepts. Let me confirm this again. When n = 319, x \u2248 0.0009976, which is in (0.0001, 0.001). When n = 3182, x \u2248 0.00010003, which is just above 0.0001, so included. So, the number of n's is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but now it's 2864. So, I must have made a mistake earlier by including n = 3183, which actually gives x outside the interval. Therefore, the correct number of x-intercepts is 2864. Let me just make sure I didn't miscalculate the subtraction. 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863. Then, adding 1 gives 2864. So, yes, 2864 is the correct number. Therefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2864 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). I think that's the answer. To recap: x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer n. We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n gives 318.309 < n < 3183.098. Since n must be integer, n ranges from 319 to 3182, inclusive.

So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems correct. But wait, 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, the function sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But let me think again: as x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is very close to zero, the function oscillates a huge number of times, leading to many x-intercepts. So, 2865 seems plausible. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the exact number by considering the interval for \u03b8 = 1/x. When x is in (0.0001, 0.001), \u03b8 = 1/x is in (1000, 10000). So, \u03b8 ranges from 1000 to 10,000 radians. Each time \u03b8 increases by \u03c0, sin(\u03b8) crosses zero. So, the number of zeros is approximately the number of times \u03b8 crosses multiples of \u03c0 in this interval. The number of zeros would be roughly (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0, which is 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866. But wait, I got 2865 earlier. Hmm, so perhaps my initial calculation was slightly off because I didn't account for the exact endpoints. Let me see: the number of zeros is the number of integers n where 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865, which matches my earlier result. But wait, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so the first n is 319, and the last n is 3183, since 3183\u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000. So, the number of n's is 3183 - 318 = 2865. Wait, no, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, leading to x = 1/(n\u03c0).

    "text": ". Therefore, there are 2865 integer values of n, each corresponding to an x-intercept in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me verify the bounds again. The lower bound for n was 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309, so n starts at 319. The upper bound was 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so n goes up to 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, I should consider whether each n in that range gives a unique x in (0.0001, 0.001). Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), as n increases, x decreases. So, when n increases by 1, x decreases. Therefore, each n corresponds to exactly one x in the interval. So, 2865 x-intercepts. Hmm, but let me check if n=3183 is included. Since 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183*3.1416) \u2248 1/10000 \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but the interval is open, so 0.0001 is excluded. So, does n=3183 correspond to x=1/(3183\u03c0) which is just above 0.0001? Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0). 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, does x=0.0001 count? No, because it's excluded. So, does n=3183 give x=1/(3183\u03c0) which is just slightly above 0.0001? Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0) exactly. 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let me compute 3183 * 3.1415926535. 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.0415926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, 3183 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 ~5.06. So adding up: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.06 \u2248 450.68. So total \u03c0*3183 \u2248 9549 + 450.68 \u2248 9999.68. Therefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.68 \u2248 0.0001000032, which is just above 0.0001. So, since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, does x=0.0001000032 count? Yes, because it's greater than 0.0001. So, n=3183 is included. Similarly, n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.83) \u2248 0.00099618, which is less than 0.001, so it's included as well. So, the count from n=319 to n=3183 is correct, giving 2865 x-intercepts. Wait, but let me check: when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099618, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. And when n=3183, x\u22480.0001000032, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. So, the total number is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, another way to think about it: the function y = sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. So, in the interval (a, b), where a is close to 0, the number of oscillations is roughly proportional to 1/a. So, in this case, the interval is from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is 10 times smaller in the upper end. So, the number of zeros should be roughly proportional to 1/0.0001 - 1/0.001 = 10000 - 1000 = 9000. But wait, that's 9000, but I got 2865. Hmm, that's a big discrepancy. Maybe my initial approach is missing something. Wait, no, because the function sin(1/x) crosses zero every \u03c0 interval in the argument 1/x. So, each zero crossing occurs when 1/x increases by \u03c0. So, the number of zeros between x=a and x=b is roughly (1/a - 1/b)/\u03c0. Let's compute that: (1/0.0001 - 1/0.001)/\u03c0 = (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 = 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.198. Which is approximately 2866. So, that's very close to the 2865 I calculated earlier. The difference is due to the fact that when I took n from 319 to 3183, I included both endpoints, but the exact count using the formula gives approximately 2866. So, my initial calculation of 2865 is likely correct, as it's just one less than 2866, probably due to the way the endpoints are handled. Therefore, I think 2865 is the correct number of x-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we determine where \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\).

So, there are 2865 integer values of n that satisfy the inequality, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts in the given interval. Wait a minute, that seems high. Let me think again. The interval is from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is a pretty small range near zero. As x approaches zero, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. So, the number of zeros should be proportional to the reciprocal of the interval's width. Let me check the length of the interval: 0.001 - 0.0001 = 0.0009. So, the interval is 0.0009 units long. But since we're dealing with 1/x, the change in 1/x over this interval is from 1000 to 10000, so the change is 9000. So, the function sin(1/x) completes 9000/(2\u03c0) cycles in this interval, each cycle having two zeros (except maybe the first or last).

So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait a second, though. I should make sure that each x = 1/(n\u03c0) is indeed within (0.0001, 0.001). Let me check for n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.14) \u2248 0.0009968, which is approximately 0.0009968, which is greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. Similarly, for n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.00) \u2248 0.0001, but since 0.0001 is excluded, I need to check if 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Let's calculate 1/(3183\u03c0): 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000.00008, so 1/10000.00008 \u2248 0.0000999999, which is just slightly less than 0.0001. Hmm, so x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0000999999, which is less than 0.0001. Therefore, it's outside the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n = 3183 would give x just below 0.0001, which is not included in the interval. Therefore, the upper bound for n should be 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) would be slightly larger than 1/(3183\u03c0), so let's check that.\n\nCalculating 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 3182 * 3 = 9546, 3182 * 0.1416 \u2248 450. So, total \u2248 9546 + 450 \u2248 9996. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996 \u2248 0.00010004, which is approximately 0.00010004, which is just above 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010004, which is inside the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n can go up to 3182. So, the upper bound is n = 3182, and the lower bound is n = 319. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought n went up to 3183, but that gives x just below 0.0001, which is excluded. So, the correct upper n is 3182. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nLet me confirm this again. For n = 319: x \u2248 0.0009968, which is within (0.0001, 0.001). For n = 3182: x \u2248 0.00010004, which is within the interval. For n = 3183: x \u2248 0.0000999999, which is less than 0.0001, so excluded. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863. Then, adding 1 gives 2864.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nBut wait, let me check with another approach to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of terms. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, if a = 319 and b = 3182, then the number is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. So, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the number of terms in the sequence 319, 320, ..., 3182. The number of terms is equal to (last term - first term) / common difference + 1. Here, the common difference is 1, so it's (3182 - 319)/1 + 1 = 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. So, that confirms it.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, which is correct? Let me double-check the initial calculation. When I first calculated n, I got n > 318.309 and n < 3183.098. So, n must be from 319 to 3183 inclusive. But when I checked n = 3183, the x was below 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the upper bound is n = 3182. So, the number of n's is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the correct number is 2864.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is: The interval (0.0001, 0.001) in terms of x corresponds to 1/x between 1000 and 10000. Because if x is 0.001, then 1/x is 1000, and if x is 0.0001, then 1/x is 10000. So, 1/x is in (1000, 10000). Now, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0, so 1/x = n\u03c0, where n is an integer. Therefore, n\u03c0 must be in (1000, 10000). So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nCalculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Wait, but earlier I found that n = 3183 gives x just below 0.0001, which is excluded. So, perhaps n can only go up to 3182. Let me check n = 3183: 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999999, which is less than 0.0001, so excluded. Therefore, n must be less than or equal to 3182 to have x \u2265 0.0001.\n\nWait, but in terms of 1/x, 1/x must be less than 10000, so 1/x < 10000, so x > 0.0001. So, 1/x must be greater than 1000, so 1/x > 1000. So, n\u03c0 must be greater than 1000 and less than 10000. So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n is from 319 to 3183 inclusive. But when n = 3183, 1/x = 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.00008, so x \u2248 0.0000999999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, n can only go up to 3182, because 3182\u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 9996, so 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010004, which is just above 0.0001, so included.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but if n starts at 319 and ends at 3182, then the number of terms is indeed 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 is 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, that's correct.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought about n going up to 3183, I got 2865, but that was incorrect because n = 3183 gives x just below 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the correct number is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. So, 1/x cannot be exactly 10000 or 1000. So, 1/x must be strictly between 1000 and 10000. Therefore, n\u03c0 must be strictly between 1000 and 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nSo, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098.\n\nTherefore, n can be 319, 320, ..., 3183.\n\nBut wait, if n = 3183, then n\u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000.00008, which is just over 10000, so 1/x = 10000.00008, so x \u2248 0.0000999999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, n cannot be 3183.\n\nSimilarly, n = 3182: n\u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 9996, which is less than 10000, so 1/x = 9996, so x \u2248 0.00010004, which is greater than 0.0001, so included.\n\nTherefore, n can be from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method. The number of zeros of sin(1/x) between a and b is equal to the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is between a and b. So, in this case, a = 0.0001 and b = 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) must be between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nTaking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities):\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nWhich is approximately:\n\n318.309 < n < 3183.098\n\nSo, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. But as we saw earlier, n = 3183 gives x just below 0.0001, which is excluded, so n must go up to 3182. Therefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the number of times 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0 as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001. Each time 1/x passes through n\u03c0, where n is an integer, the function sin(1/x) crosses zero. So, the number of zeros is equal to the number of integers n such that 1/x = n\u03c0, with x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, again, n ranges from 319 to 3182, giving 2864 zeros.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, let me compute 3182 - 319 + 1 again:\n\n3182 - 319 = 2863\n\n2863 + 1 = 2864\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 2864.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

For n=319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.9) \u2248 0.000996, which is just under 0.001, so it's included.

So, x=0.0001 is excluded, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, so it's on the boundary. Therefore, n=3183 would give x=0.0001, which is not included in the interval. Therefore, the upper bound for n should be 3182 instead of 3183. Let me recalculate that. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.098, so the largest integer n is 3183, but as we saw, that gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the largest integer n such that x > 0.0001 is 3182. Let's check n=3182: x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000 - \u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.98 \u2248 0.00010003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. So, n goes from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Now, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, there are 2864 integer values of n, which correspond to 2864 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check this because earlier I thought it was 2865, but now it's 2864. Let me verify with specific examples. For example, if n starts at 1 and goes to 3, the number of terms is 3 - 1 + 1 = 3, which is correct (n=1,2,3). Similarly, from 319 to 3182: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864.

The number of integers in this range is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\n$\\boxed{2864}$"

First, the substitution: x = 1/(n\u03c0). Then, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n, I correctly inverted the inequalities by taking reciprocals, remembering that inverting reverses the inequality signs, but since I was multiplying by n\u03c0 which is positive, I didn't reverse the inequality again. Wait, actually, when I have 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0), taking reciprocals would give me n\u03c0 < 10000, so n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 gives n\u03c0 > 1000, so n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, yes, that part seems correct. Then, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, that seems correct.

I think that makes sense because as x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x becomes very large, so sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is very close to zero, the function oscillates a huge number of times, leading to many x-intercepts. So, 2865 seems like a reasonable number.
