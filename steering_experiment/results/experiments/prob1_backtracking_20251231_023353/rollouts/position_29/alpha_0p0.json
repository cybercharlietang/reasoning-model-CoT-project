    "text": " Let's compute those bounds. The smallest integer greater than 318.309 is 319. The largest integer less than 3183.098 is 3183. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range, from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers, inclusive, we can use the formula: Number of integers = (upper bound - lower bound) + 1 So, plugging in the numbers: Number of integers = (3183 - 319) + 1 Let me compute that. 3183 - 319 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Each of these n values corresponds to an x-intercept of the function y = sin(1/x) in the given interval. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, 1/(0.0001\u03c0) is indeed 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. Then, 1/(0.001\u03c0) is 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1, so 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of it as 3183 - 318 = 2865, but since n starts at 319, which is 318 + 1, maybe that's another way to look at it. Either way, I get 2865 as the number of x-intercepts.

Now, to find how many integers are in this range, I can subtract 318 from both ends to make it easier. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, plugging in, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive.

Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems like a lot of intercepts. Let me double-check my calculations. So, 1/(0.0001\u03c0) is indeed 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, and 1/(0.001\u03c0) is 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 x-intercepts in that interval. Wait a second, but I remember that as x approaches 0, 1/x approaches infinity, and sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a small interval near zero, the function sin(1/x) should have a lot of oscillations, leading to many x-intercepts. So, 2865 seems plausible, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the range of n. Let me check with specific values. For n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.37) \u2248 0.0009976, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. For n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) = 0.0001, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), not including 0.0001, so n should go up to 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, which is the lower bound. Since the interval is open at 0.0001, x must be greater than 0.0001, so n must be less than 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, the largest integer n is 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, which is the lower bound. Since the interval is open at 0.0001, does that mean n can be up to 3183? Wait, x must be greater than 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n can be up to 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, which is the lower bound. Since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so n must be less than 3183.098, so n can be 3183, because 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but x must be greater than 0.0001, so n must be less than 3183.098, meaning n can be up to 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is not included. So, actually, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is equal to 0.0001, which is excluded, so n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum n is 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded, so the next lower n is 3182. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but let me compute it more accurately. Let me compute 1/(3183 * \u03c0). \u03c0 \u2248 3.1415926535, so 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 3183*3 = 9549, 3183*0.1416 \u2248 3183*0.1=318.3, 3183*0.04=127.32, 3183*0.0016\u22485.0928. Adding those up: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.0928 \u2248 450.7128. So total \u2248 9549 + 450.7128 \u2248 10,000. So, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound of the interval, which is excluded. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 is excluded, so the next lower n is 3182. Wait, but that would mean x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182*3.1416) \u2248 1/(10,000 - something). Let me compute 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 3182*3 = 9546, 3182*0.1416 \u2248 3182*0.1=318.2, 3182*0.04=127.28, 3182*0.0016\u22485.0912. Adding up: 318.2 + 127.28 = 445.48 + 5.0912 \u2248 450.5712. So total \u2248 9546 + 450.5712 \u2248 9996.5712. So, 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 9996.5712, so 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.5712 \u2248 0.000100034, which is slightly above 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100034, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. Therefore, n can be up to 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 is excluded, so the maximum n is 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is excluded, so the next lower n is 3182, which gives x \u2248 0.000100034, which is included. Wait, but earlier I thought n goes up to 3183, but now I'm confused because x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded, so n can only go up to 3182. Let me clarify. The inequality is x > 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but wait, if n = 3183, then x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is not greater than 0.0001, it's equal. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3183 - 1 = 3182. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 gives 2864. Wait, that's different from my earlier calculation. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by including n = 3183, but actually, n must be less than 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded, so n must be up to 3182. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought n starts at 319 and goes to 3183, giving 2865 intercepts, but now I'm getting 2864. Which one is correct? Let me check with n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009976, which is less than 0.001, so included. n = 3182: x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100034, which is greater than 0.0001, so included. n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 = 2864. So, the correct number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought n goes up to 3183, but since x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is excluded, n must go up to 3182. So, the total number is 2864. Let me confirm this with another approach. The number of zeros of sin(1/x) in (a, b) is equal to the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (a, b). So, solving for n: 1/(n\u03c0) > a => n < 1/(a\u03c0) and 1/(n\u03c0) < b => n > 1/(b\u03c0). So, n must satisfy 1/(b\u03c0) < n < 1/(a\u03c0). Since n must be an integer, the number of n's is floor(1/(a\u03c0) - 1) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) + 1. Wait, maybe a better way is to compute floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) + 1. Let me see. Let me compute 1/(a\u03c0) where a = 0.0001: 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, floor(1/(a\u03c0)) = 3183. Similarly, 1/(b\u03c0) where b = 0.001: 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) = 319. Therefore, the number of integers n is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) + 1 = 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but earlier I thought n must be less than 3183.098, so n up to 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is excluded, so n should be up to 3182. But according to this formula, it's floor(1/(a\u03c0)) which is 3183, minus ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) which is 319, plus 1, giving 2865. So, which is correct? Let me think about it. The formula floor(1/(a\u03c0)) gives the largest integer n such that 1/(n\u03c0) \u2265 a. But since a is the lower bound, which is excluded, we need n such that 1/(n\u03c0) > a, which is n < 1/(a\u03c0). So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183. But wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is equal to a, which is excluded. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is excluded, so the maximum n is 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is excluded, so the number of n's is floor(1/(a\u03c0) - 1) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) + 1. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think differently. The number of zeros is equal to the number of integers n where 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001). So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. So, n must satisfy 318.309 < n < 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. But wait, earlier I thought that n = 3183 gives x = 0.0001, which is excluded, so n should go up to 3182. But according to this, n can be up to 3183 because 3183 < 3183.098. Wait, n must be less than 3183.098, so n can be 3183 because 3183 < 3183.098. So, n = 3183 is allowed because 3183 < 3183.098. Therefore, n can be 3183, and x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since the interval is open at 0.0001, x must be greater than 0.0001. So, is x = 1/(3183\u03c0) greater than 0.0001? Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10,000) = 0.0001. So, exactly 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, n = 3183 gives x = 0.0001, which is excluded, so n must be up to 3182. Therefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. Wait, but according to the formula floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) + 1, it's 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, which one is correct? Let me think about it again. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at both ends. So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) must be in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities because reciprocals reverse inequalities for positive numbers): 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. Therefore, n must be an integer in (318.309, 3183.098), which means n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. However, when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is exactly the lower bound, which is excluded. Therefore, n cannot be 3183 because x would be equal to 0.0001, which is not in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but since x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is excluded, n must be up to 3182. Therefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. So, the correct number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought the formula gives 2865. So, which is it? Let me check with specific n values. For n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009976 < 0.001, so included. For n = 3182: x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100034 > 0.0001, so included. For n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 = 2864. So, the correct number is 2864. Therefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2864 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but earlier I thought 2865, but now I'm getting 2864. Let me see: the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, from 319 to 3182 inclusive, it's 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.

Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the values: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 = 2864; 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. Hmm, 3183 - 319 is indeed 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. But let me think again: if n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, the number of terms is 3183 - 318 = 2865. Wait, why did I subtract 319? Oh, no, actually, when counting from a to b inclusive, the number of integers is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that seems correct. But wait, let me think about whether n can actually be 3183. Since x must be greater than 0.0001, let's check if n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0). Let's calculate that: 3183\u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416. Let me compute that. 3000 * 3.1416 = 9424.8, and 183 * 3.1416 \u2248 183 * 3 = 549, 183 * 0.1416 \u2248 26, so total \u2248 549 + 26 = 575. So, 9424.8 + 575 \u2248 10,000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10000 = 0.0001. But wait, our interval is x > 0.0001, so x must be greater than 0.0001, which is 0.0001. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, which is the lower bound. But since the interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), x must be greater than 0.0001, not equal. So, does n=3183 give x=1/(3183\u03c0) which is approximately 0.0001, but since it's open, that point is excluded. So, perhaps n=3183 is not included. Similarly, let's check n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0). Let's compute 319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 319 * 3 = 957, 319 * 0.1416 \u2248 45. So, total \u2248 957 + 45 \u2248 1002. So, x \u2248 1/1002 \u2248 0.000998, which is approximately 0.001. But our upper limit is x < 0.001, so x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000998 is less than 0.001, so it's included. Wait, but let me be precise. Let's calculate 1/(319\u03c0): \u03c0 \u2248 3.14159265, so 319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.14159265. Let me compute 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477, 19\u03c0 \u2248 59.690, so total \u2248 942.477 + 59.690 \u2248 1002.167. So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.167 \u2248 0.0009978, which is indeed less than 0.001, so it's included. Now, for n=3183: 3183\u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265. Let me compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.777, 183\u03c0 \u2248 575.156, so total \u2248 9424.777 + 575.156 \u2248 10,000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10,000 = 0.0001, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, this x is exactly 0.0001, which is not included in the open interval. Therefore, n=3183 is excluded. So, n can go up to 3182. Let me check n=3182: 3182\u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.14159265. Again, 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.777, 182\u03c0 \u2248 572.002, so total \u2248 9424.777 + 572.002 \u2248 9996.779. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.779 \u2248 0.00010003, which is just slightly above 0.0001, so it is included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n=3182 gives x\u22480.00010003, which is in the interval. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Now, let's calculate the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Using the formula: number of terms = last - first + 1 = 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 = 2864. Wait, that contradicts my earlier calculation. Wait, earlier I thought n went up to 3183, but now I see n=3183 is excluded, so n goes up to 3182. So, from 319 to 3182 inclusive, the number of terms is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863. Then, +1 gives 2864. So, there are 2864 integers n from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Therefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2864 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me think again: when n increases, x decreases. So, as n goes from 319 upwards, x decreases from 1/(319\u03c0) down to 1/(3182\u03c0), which is just above 0.0001. So, each n corresponds to a unique x in the interval, and since n is an integer, each x is unique. So, the number of intercepts is equal to the number of integers n between 319 and 3182 inclusive, which is 2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need to find the integers n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n, we find n ranges from 319 to 3182, giving 2864 intercepts.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}."

Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. 3183 minus 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me think again. When counting integers from a to b inclusive, the number of integers is b - a + 1. So, if n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, then the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that step by step: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, that seems correct. But wait, let me check if n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0), which should be just above 0.0001, and n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0), which should be just below 0.001. Let me verify with n=319: 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(319*3.1416) \u2248 1/(1003.2) \u2248 0.0009968, which is about 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Wait, but 0.0009968 is less than 0.001, so it's included. Now, for n=3183: 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183*3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, but since our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), it's open at 0.0001, so x must be greater than 0.0001. So, n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001, which is exactly the lower bound, but since the interval is open, we need to exclude n=3183. Wait, but earlier I calculated n < 3183.098, so n=3183 is less than that, so it's included. Wait, no, because 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, x must be greater than 0.0001. So, x=1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is equal to the lower bound, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so n must be less than 3183.098, meaning n=3183 is not allowed because x would be exactly 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, not 3183. Let me check that again. If n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is the lower bound, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), it's open, so x must be greater than 0.0001. Therefore, n must satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0)\u22483183.098. So, n must be less than 3183.098, meaning the maximum integer n is 3183, but wait, 3183 is less than 3183.098, so n=3183 is allowed because 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is greater than 0.0001? Wait, no, because 3183\u03c0\u224810000.0, so 1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001 exactly. So, since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, x must be strictly greater than 0.0001, so n must be such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which is equivalent to n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0)=3183.098. So, n can be up to 3183, but when n=3183, x=0.0001 exactly, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. Let me confirm this with actual calculation. Let's compute 1/(3183\u03c0): 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 183\u03c0\u2248574.7259, so total \u22489424.77796 + 574.7259\u224810,000. So, 3183\u03c0\u224810,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001 exactly. Therefore, x=0.0001 when n=3183, which is excluded because the interval is (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but since n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, the maximum allowed n is 3182. Similarly, for the lower bound, n must be greater than 1/(0.001\u03c0)=318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Now, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, there are 2864 integer values of n, which correspond to 2864 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but now I'm getting 2864. Which one is correct? Let's think again: the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, if a=319 and b=3182, then the count is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. So, that's correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. But wait, let me check with specific values. Let's take n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009968, which is less than 0.001 and greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Similarly, n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22481/(3182*3.1416)\u22481/(10,000 - 3.1416)\u22480.00010001, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. Now, n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. So, the number of n's is from 319 to 3182, which is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought it was 2865, but now it's 2864. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the subtraction. 3182 - 319: Let's compute 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863. Then, adding 1 gives 2864. Yes, that's correct. So, the number is 2864. But wait, I think I might have miscounted because when I subtract 319 from 3182, I get 2863, and adding 1 gives 2864. So, that's correct. Alternatively, think of it as the number of integers between 319 and 3182 inclusive. For example, from 1 to m, there are m numbers. So, from 1 to 3182, there are 3182 numbers, and from 1 to 318, there are 318 numbers. So, the numbers from 319 to 3182 are 3182 - 318 = 2864 numbers. Yes, that's another way to see it. So, 3182 - 318 = 2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but let me think again: when n=319, x\u22480.0009968, which is within (0.0001, 0.001). When n=3182, x\u22480.00010001, which is just above 0.0001, so included. So, the count is correct at 2864. Therefore, the final answer is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), which translates to n ranging from 319 to 3182. The number of integers in this range is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}."

The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me calculate that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there should be 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but I should double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me go through it again. Starting with x = 1/(n\u03c0), and x is between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and remembering to reverse the inequalities because reciprocating positive numbers reverses the inequality), we get: 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing each part by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating these, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098.

The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, if n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, the bounds for n: n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n starts at 319. n must be less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n ends at 3183. Now, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me think again. Is there any chance that some of these x-values might fall outside the interval (0.0001, 0.001)? For example, when n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.5) \u2248 0.000996, which is just below 0.001, so it's within the interval. When n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, which is exactly the lower bound, but the interval is open at 0.0001, so x must be greater than 0.0001. Therefore, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 is not included. Hmm, so does that mean n should be less than 3183? Wait, let's see: x must be greater than 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. That implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than 3183.098, meaning the maximum integer n is 3183. But when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's actually outside the interval. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.098, but n must be an integer, so the maximum n is 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the maximum n is actually 3182 because 1/(3182\u03c0) would be greater than 0.0001. Let me check: 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000 - \u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.999 \u2248 0.0001000001, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. So, n can go up to 3182, not 3183. Therefore, the upper bound for n is 3182. So, now, the range of n is from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion. So, I need to be careful here. Let me recast this. The x must satisfy 0.0001 < x < 0.001, which is equivalent to 10^{-4} < x < 10^{-3}. So, x = 1/(n\u03c0) must satisfy 10^{-4} < 1/(n\u03c0) < 10^{-3}. Let's solve for n. Starting with 1/(n\u03c0) > 10^{-4}: n < 1/(\u03c0 * 10^{-4}) = 10^4 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n < 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10000 \u2248 0.0001, which is equal to the lower bound, but the interval is open at 0.0001, so x must be greater than 0.0001. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.098, but n must be an integer, so the maximum n is 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182 because 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000 - \u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.999 \u2248 0.0001000001, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. Similarly, for the lower bound: 1/(n\u03c0) < 10^{-3}, which gives n > 10^3 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n must be at least 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Now, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, which one is correct? Let's double-check with an example. Suppose n starts at a and ends at b. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, if a = 319 and b = 3182, then it's 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863. Then, 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, yes, 2864. Therefore, the correct number is 2864. So, I think my initial calculation was wrong because I included n = 3183, which gives x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is not included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the correct number is 2864. Wait, but let me confirm with another approach. Let's consider the interval (0.0001, 0.001). The reciprocal of this interval is (1000, 10000). So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. So, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0, i.e., 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). Therefore, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. As before, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183, but wait, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n must be less than that, meaning n = 3183 is excluded because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000, which would make x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded. So, n goes up to 3182. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. But wait, let me think again. When n = 3182, x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000 - \u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000001, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. When n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is exactly the lower bound, but since the interval is open, it's excluded. Therefore, n goes up to 3182. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. So, that's the answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the subtraction. 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19: 2882 - 19 = 2863. Then, 2863 + 1 = 2864. Yes, that's correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) has x-intercepts where \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\).

    "text": " The smallest integer greater than 318.309 is 319, and the largest integer less than 3183.098 is 3183. Now, I need to count how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, plugging in a = 319 and b = 3183: Number of integers = 3183 - 319 + 1 = Let's compute that. 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, starting with the inequalities: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n, as I did, gives n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be an integer from 319 to 3183. Then, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is indeed 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check if 1/(n\u03c0) is indeed within (0.0001, 0.001) for n = 319 and n = 3183. For n = 319: 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.32) \u2248 0.0009966, which is approximately 0.0009966, which is just under 0.001, so that's within the interval. For n = 3183: 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, which is exactly 0.0001, but the interval is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001, so n = 3183 gives x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), x must be greater than 0.0001. So, does n = 3183 give x just above 0.0001? Wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001 exactly, but since it's an open interval, x must be greater than 0.0001, so n = 3183 would give x = 0.0001 exactly, which is excluded. Therefore, n should go up to 3182. Wait, that's a problem. Let me recast the inequalities. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, for x = 1/(n\u03c0), we have 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me solve for n again. Starting with 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n\u03c0 < 10000 => n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183. But wait, if n = 3183, then x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so x = 0.0001 is excluded. Therefore, n must be such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which implies n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is not included. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but x would be equal to 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n should be 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000 - \u03c0) \u2248 slightly more than 0.0001. Let me compute 1/(3182\u03c0): 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 Let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77, 182\u03c0 \u2248 571.88, so total \u2248 9424.77 + 571.88 \u2248 10, 996.65. Wait, that can't be right because 3182 * \u03c0 is about 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 let me compute 3000 * 3.1416 = 9424.8, 182 * 3.1416 \u2248 182*3=546, 182*0.1416\u224825.8, so total \u2248546 +25.8\u2248571.8, so total \u22489424.8 +571.8\u224810, 000 approximately? Wait, that can't be right because 3183 * \u03c0 is approximately 10,000, so 3182 * \u03c0 is approximately 10,000 - \u03c0, which is about 10,000 - 3.1416 \u2248 9996.8584. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.8584 \u2248 0.00010003, which is just slightly above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n can go up to 3183, but when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is excluded, so n must be up to 3182. Wait, but earlier I thought n could be up to 3183, but now I'm confused. Let me clarify.\n\nLet me define the interval again: x must satisfy 0.0001 < x < 0.001. So, for x = 1/(n\u03c0), we have:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nWhich implies:\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing all parts by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nWhich is approximately:\n\n318.309 < n < 3183.098\n\nSince n must be an integer, n can take integer values from 319 up to 3183. However, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is exactly the lower bound, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001. Therefore, n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is not included. So, the maximum n is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.00010003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nWait, but 1/(3182\u03c0) is approximately 1/(10000 - \u03c0) \u2248 0.00010003, which is indeed greater than 0.0001, so it's included. So, n can go up to 3182. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 +1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 gives 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, where did I go wrong? Let me check again.\n\nThe initial calculation was n from 319 to 3183, giving 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. But since n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, n must only go up to 3182. So, the correct count is from 319 to 3182, which is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864.\n\nWait, let me confirm with an example. Suppose n starts at 319 and ends at 3182. The number of terms is (3182 - 319) +1 = 2864.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by including n=3183, which gives x=0.0001, which is not in the open interval. Therefore, the correct number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.00010003, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. And n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009966, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182, inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, which is correct? Let me compute 3182 - 319:\n\n3182 - 319 = 2863\n\nThen, 2863 +1 = 2864.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you count inclusive, you have to make sure you're not off by one. Let me test with smaller numbers. For example, how many integers from 3 to 5 inclusive? 3,4,5: that's 3 numbers. So, 5 -3 +1=3. Similarly, from 319 to 3182: 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the initial mistake was including n=3183, which gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so n goes up to 3182, giving 2864 intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when I solved 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, I got n < 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.098, so n can be up to 3183. But when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)= approximately 0.0001, which is excluded. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is not included. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum n is 3183, but x=1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001 is excluded, so the maximum n is 3182.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0)=approx 0.0001, which is excluded, so n=3183 is not allowed. Therefore, n goes up to 3182, so the number of intercepts is 2864.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. We set sin(1/x)=0, which implies 1/x = n\u03c0, so x=1/(n\u03c0).\n\n2. We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\n3. Solving for n, we find 318.309 < n < 3183.098.\n\n4. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\n5. The number of integers from 319 to 3182 is 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer n. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), n ranges from 319 to 3182, resulting in 2864 intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2864}$"

    "text": " That would be n = 319, 320, ..., 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. To find the number of integers from a to b inclusive, it's b - a + 1. So, here, a = 319 and b = 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. First, 1/(0.0001\u03c0) is indeed 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so the upper bound for n is 3183. The lower bound was 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so the lower integer is 319. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, that seems correct. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in that interval. But wait, let me think again. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. So, between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is from x = 0.0001 to x = 0.001, as x increases, 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000. So, the argument of the sine function goes from 1000 to 10000 radians. Each time the sine function completes a full cycle (2\u03c0), it crosses zero twice: once going up and once going down. So, the number of zeros should be approximately the number of cycles multiplied by 2. Alternatively, the number of zeros is equal to the number of times the argument passes through a multiple of \u03c0. So, perhaps another way to think about it is to find how many times 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0 as x moves from 0.0001 to 0.001. So, starting at x = 0.0001, 1/x = 10000. The next zero after that would be at 10000 - \u03c0, then 10000 - 2\u03c0, etc., until we reach 1/x = 1000. So, the number of zeros would be the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. Wait, but 10000 is at x = 0.0001, and 1000 is at x = 0.001. So, as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000. So, we need to find how many times 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0 in this decreasing interval. So, the first zero after x = 0.0001 would be at 1/x = 10000 - \u03c0, then 10000 - 2\u03c0, and so on, until 1/x is just above 1000. So, the number of zeros would be the number of times we can subtract \u03c0 from 10000 until we reach just above 1000. So, the number of zeros N is the largest integer n such that 10000 - n\u03c0 > 1000. So, 10000 - n\u03c0 > 1000 => n\u03c0 < 9000 => n < 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.23. So, the maximum integer n is 2866. But wait, that's different from the previous calculation where I got 2865. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think carefully. The zeros occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0), so for each n, x is 1/(n\u03c0). So, when x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, 1/(n\u03c0) is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is equivalent to n\u03c0 being between 1000 and 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n must be between 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that's the same as before. But in the second approach, I considered the number of times 1/x crosses multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000, which would be the number of n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which is the same as n between 319 and 3183, giving 2865 zeros. However, in the first approach, I thought of it as the number of oscillations, each contributing two zeros, but that might not be the correct way because the interval is not symmetric or something. Wait, perhaps the confusion arises because when x approaches 0, 1/x approaches infinity, so the function oscillates infinitely many times. But in our case, x is bounded away from 0, so 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, the number of zeros should be the number of times sin(1/x) crosses zero in that interval, which is indeed each time 1/x crosses an integer multiple of \u03c0. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is the same as n between 319 and 3183, giving 2865 zeros. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 2865. But wait, let me check the endpoints. When x = 0.0001, 1/x = 10000. Is 10000 a multiple of \u03c0? Let's see, 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, which is not an integer, so x = 0.0001 is not a zero. Similarly, at x = 0.001, 1/x = 1000, which is also not a multiple of \u03c0 because 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.309, which is not an integer. So, the zeros are strictly between 0.0001 and 0.001, so n ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 zeros. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. This translates to x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 1/(n\u03c0) must be between 0.0001 and 0.001. Solving for n gives n between approximately 318.309 and 3183.098. Thus, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

Therefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in that interval. Wait, let me double-check my calculations. The lower bound for n was 318.309, so n starts at 319. The upper bound was 3183.098, so n goes up to 3183. The number of terms from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1.

To find the number of integers between two numbers a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the values: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 = 2864; 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again. Wait, 3183 - 319 is actually 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then minus 19 more is 2864. So, 2864 + 1 is 2865. So, that suggests there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. But wait, let me think again. Each n corresponds to a unique x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, each n gives exactly one x-intercept. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts should be equal to the number of integers n in that range. So, 2865 x-intercepts. Hmm, that seems like a lot, but considering the interval is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a very small range near zero, and the function sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely as x approaches zero, it makes sense that there are so many intercepts. Let me just verify the steps once more to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Start with y = sin(1/x). We set this equal to zero: sin(1/x) = 0.\n2. Solve for x: 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0).\n3. Find x in (0.0001, 0.001): 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n4. Solve for n: 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0).\n5. Calculate 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309 and 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098.\n6. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n7. Number of integers: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check if the endpoints are included. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. So, I need to make sure that x = 1/(n\u03c0) is strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. So, when n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.87) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001. Similarly, n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) = 0.0001, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but since the interval is open, we need to exclude it. Wait, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but let me calculate it more precisely.\n\nCalculating 3183\u03c0: 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.1416 \u2248 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, 3183 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0928. Adding up: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.0928 \u2248 450.7128. So total is 9549 + 450.7128 \u2248 9999.7128. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.7128 \u2248 0.0001000028, which is just slightly above 0.0001. But since our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000028 is just barely above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. Similarly, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's included as well.\n\nWait, but when n increases, x decreases. So, n = 319 gives x \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, and n = 3183 gives x \u2248 0.0001000028, which is just above 0.0001. So, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive will give x in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check if n=3183 is allowed. Since x must be greater than 0.0001, and 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000028 > 0.0001, so it's allowed. Similarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.000997 < 0.001, so it's allowed. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which gives 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to n ranging from 319 to 3183.

Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then minus 19 more is 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, that's correct. So, there are 2865 integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive.

Wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, I started by setting sin(1/x) = 0, which implies 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). Then, I substituted x into the interval inequalities to find the range for n, which gave me n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be from 319 to 3183.

Hmm, but let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe by considering the behavior of the function sin(1/x). As x approaches 0 from the positive side, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. The interval (0.0001, 0.001) is very close to zero, so the function will oscillate a lot there. Each oscillation of sin(1/x) crosses the x-axis twice, once going up and once going down. Wait, no, actually, each period of sin(\u03b8) is 2\u03c0, and in each period, it crosses zero twice. But in this case, since \u03b8 = 1/x, as x decreases, \u03b8 increases, so each increase of 2\u03c0 in \u03b8 corresponds to a decrease in x by a factor that depends on x. So, the number of zeros should be roughly proportional to the change in \u03b8 over the interval. Let me try this approach to confirm. The interval for x is from 0.0001 to 0.001, so the corresponding \u03b8 values are \u03b81 = 1/0.0001 = 10000 and \u03b82 = 1/0.001 = 1000. Wait, no, actually, when x is 0.0001, \u03b8 = 1/0.0001 = 10000, and when x is 0.001, \u03b8 = 1/0.001 = 1000. So, \u03b8 decreases from 10000 to 1000 as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001. So, the change in \u03b8 is from 10000 down to 1000, which is a change of 9000. Each period of sin(\u03b8) is 2\u03c0, so the number of periods between \u03b8 = 1000 and \u03b8 = 10000 is (10000 - 1000)/(2\u03c0) \u2248 9000 / 6.283 \u2248 1432.4. Since each period has two zeros, the number of zeros would be approximately 2 * 1432.4 \u2248 2864.8. But wait, earlier I got 2865 zeros. That seems very close. The slight difference is probably due to the endpoints. When \u03b8 is exactly 1000, sin(1000) might be zero or not, depending on whether 1000 is an integer multiple of \u03c0. Similarly for \u03b8 = 10000. Let me check if 1000 is a multiple of \u03c0. 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.309, which is not an integer, so sin(1000) is not zero. Similarly, 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, which is also not an integer, so sin(10000) is not zero. Therefore, the number of zeros should be approximately the number of half-periods between \u03b8 = 1000 and \u03b8 = 10000, which is (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 \u2248 9000 / 3.1416 \u2248 2866.2. But wait, that's not matching my previous count. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The first method where I found n from 319 to 3183 inclusive gives exactly 2865 zeros, which aligns closely with the approximate calculation here. So, I think 2865 is the correct number. Let me just make sure that I didn't make a mistake in calculating the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. That seems right because the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, yes, 2865 is correct. I think I've double-checked it enough. So, the answer is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n gives 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. The integers n range from 319 to 3183, inclusive.

If n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, hold on, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with the inequalities: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, solving for n, we get 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0). Which is 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098. Therefore, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest is 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1.

I think that makes sense because as x approaches zero from the right, 1/x becomes very large, so sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. But in this case, we're looking at x between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a fairly small interval near zero, so the function will oscillate a lot, leading to many x-intercepts. Each time n increases by 1, the x-intercept moves closer to zero, so the number of intercepts increases as we go closer to zero. So, the count being in the thousands seems plausible.

When n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.0001, does x=0.0001 count? Wait, no, because the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open on both ends. So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's actually outside the interval. So, n=3183 would give x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099999, wait, no, let me compute more accurately. Wait, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000.0, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001.

So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099999... Wait, actually, let me compute 3182\u03c0: 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 3182 * 3 = 9546, 3182 * 0.1416 \u2248 450, so total \u2248 9546 + 450 \u2248 9996. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996 \u2248 0.00010004, which is just above 0.0001. So, that would be included in the interval. So, n can go up to 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010004 > 0.0001, so it's included. Similarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, the range of n is from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3182 inclusive, we compute 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's do that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, there are 2864 integers in this range, which means there are 2864 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).

Because 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more to get 2864. So, 2864 + 1 is indeed 2865. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in determining the range for n. Let me verify the inequalities again. Starting with 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me solve for n in both inequalities again. First inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Taking reciprocals (and remembering that flipping the inequality when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive): 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. So, 10000 > n\u03c0, which leads to n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n must be less than that, which is correct. Second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals again: n\u03c0 > 1000, so n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n must be greater than that, which is correct. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183.

Let's approximate \u03c0 as 3.1416. So, 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 319 * 3.1416. Let's compute that: 300 * 3.1416 = 942.48, 19 * 3.1416 \u2248 59.6904, so total \u2248 942.48 + 59.6904 \u2248 1002.1704.

Wait, but I thought n had to be greater than 318.309, so n=319 is the first integer. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the inequality direction. Let me clarify: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319.

Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range from 319 to 3183, inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the numbers: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 = 2864; then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Let me verify the values of n. When x = 0.001, which is the upper bound, 1/x = 1000, so n\u03c0 = 1000, so n = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, the first n is 319.

Let me compute that again: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct. But just to make sure, let me check with a smaller example. Suppose I have n from 2 to 5. The numbers are 2,3,4,5. So, 5 - 2 +1 = 4, which is correct. So, applying the same logic here, 3183 - 319 +1 is indeed 2865. So, the function sin(1/x) crosses the x-axis 2865 times between 0.0001 and 0.001. That seems like a lot, but considering how rapidly sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches zero, it makes sense that there are so many intercepts in such a small interval. Each time x decreases by a tiny amount, 1/x increases by a larger amount, causing the sine function to complete another oscillation, leading to another intercept. So, yeah, I think 2865 is the correct number of x-intercepts in that interval.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need to find the integers n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n gives 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

    "text": " The smallest integer greater than 318.309 is 319, and the largest integer less than 3183.098 is 3183. Now, I need to count how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, plugging in a = 319 and b = 3183: Number of integers = 3183 - 319 + 1 Let me calculate that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n that satisfy the condition, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations. So, 1/(0.0001\u03c0) is indeed 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 3183.098, and 1/(0.001\u03c0) is 1000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.309. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. Now, 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct. Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, I can consider the function sin(1/x) and note that as x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. The interval (0.0001, 0.001) is very close to zero, so the function oscillates a lot there. Each period of sin(1/x) corresponds to an increase of \u03c0 in 1/x. So, the number of zeros in the interval would be roughly the number of periods of the sine function between 1/0.001 and 1/0.0001. Let's compute those values: 1/0.001 = 1000, and 1/0.0001 = 10000. So, the function sin(1/x) goes from sin(1000) to sin(10000). The number of zeros in this interval would be the number of times sin(\u03b8) crosses zero as \u03b8 goes from 1000 to 10000. Each zero crossing occurs every \u03c0 units, so the number of zeros is approximately (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0. Let me compute that: (10000 - 1000) = 9000, so 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 9000/3.1416 \u2248 2866.198. Hmm, that's about 2866. But earlier, I calculated 2865. There's a slight discrepancy here. Wait, perhaps because the exact number of zeros is the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. So, the number of zeros would be the floor of (10000/\u03c0) minus the ceiling of (1000/\u03c0). Let me compute that. First, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so the floor is 3183. 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so the ceiling is 319. Therefore, the number of zeros is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That matches my initial calculation. The other approach gave me approximately 2866, which is close but slightly off because it's an approximation. So, the exact number is 2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Solving for x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) gives n ranging from 319 to 3183, inclusive. Counting these integers yields 2865 x-intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

Now, to find the number of integers in this range, I subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add one (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but hold on a second. Let me double-check that subtraction. 3183 minus 319: Let's see, 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. So, yes, 2864, then +1 is 2865. Hmm, that seems like a lot. Let me think again. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0, right? So, in the interval from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is very close to zero, the function oscillates rapidly, crossing the x-axis many times. So, 2865 intercepts in that tiny interval seems plausible. But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations. Let me go through it again.\n\nStarting with x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, x = 1/(n\u03c0). Therefore, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and remembering to flip the inequalities because reciprocals reverse the inequality for positive numbers): 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. That is, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing all parts by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating those: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Yep, that seems consistent. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Therefore, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me just think about whether I included all possible n. For example, when n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.8) \u2248 0.000996, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Similarly, when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.4) \u2248 0.000099996, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's also within the interval. So, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive are valid, giving 2865 intercepts. I think that's correct. So, I don't see any mistake in my reasoning. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

So, plugging in the values: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, there are 2865 integers in this range, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait a second, let me double-check that calculation. 3183 minus 319 is indeed 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me think about whether I'm including both endpoints correctly. Since n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, each integer in between is counted once. So, yes, the count should be 3183 - 319 + 1. Another way to think about it is that the number of integers from m to n inclusive is n - m + 1. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 gives 2865. That seems right. Alternatively, I can consider that between 0.0001 and 0.001, the function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly as x approaches 0. Each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the function completes another oscillation, crossing the x-axis. So, the number of zeros is essentially how many times 1/x can pass through multiples of \u03c0 in that interval. So, another way to compute it is to find the difference in 1/x between the two ends of the interval and then divide by \u03c0 to get the number of zeros. Let's see, 1/(0.0001) = 10000 and 1/(0.001) = 1000. So, the difference is 10000 - 1000 = 9000. The number of zeros would then be approximately 9000 / \u03c0 \u2248 9000 / 3.1416 \u2248 2866.

But when I compute (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 \u2248 9000 / 3.1416 \u2248 2866. So, why is there a difference of 1? Let me see. The exact number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which translates to n between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0. So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of n's is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. But when I compute (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0, I get approximately 2866. The difference is because 10000 - 1000 = 9000, but when we take the integer parts, the exact count is 2865. So, the approximate method gives 2866, but the exact count is 2865. So, the correct answer is 2865.

Let me check my calculations again. 3183 minus 319: Let's compute 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But wait, let me think again. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely as x approaches 0, but in this case, our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is a very small interval near zero. So, as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000. So, \u03b8 = 1/x goes from 1000 to 10000 radians. Now, each time \u03b8 increases by \u03c0, sin(\u03b8) completes a full cycle and crosses zero. So, the number of zeros should be approximately the number of times \u03b8 passes through multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. So, the number of zeros is roughly (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0, which is about 9000 / 3.1416 \u2248 2866. But wait, my earlier count was 2865. Hmm, so there's a slight discrepancy here. Maybe because when I calculated n, I included both endpoints, but perhaps in the actual function, the exact endpoints might not be included because the interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001). So, x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001, so n cannot be exactly 10000/\u03c0 or 1000/\u03c0. Wait, let me clarify. When I found n, I had x = 1/(n\u03c0), so for x to be in (0.0001, 0.001), n must satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, n must be less than 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098 and greater than 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that's correct. The approximate count using the interval length was about 2866, but the exact count is 2865 because n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, which gives 2865 terms. So, I think that's the correct number of x-intercepts. Therefore, the answer should be 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) has x-intercepts where \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\).

    "text": " The smallest integer greater than 318.309 is 319, and the largest integer less than 3183.098 is 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers, I can subtract the smaller number from the larger one and add 1. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's calculate that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers in that range. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I set sin(1/x) = 0, which gives 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). Then, I substituted x into the interval (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n, I correctly inverted the inequalities and found n must be between approximately 318.309 and 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1, which is 2865. That seems correct. However, I should consider whether the endpoints 0.0001 and 0.001 are included. The interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), so we're not including the endpoints. So, x must be strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. Therefore, we need to check if x = 1/(319\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001 and x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.001. Let me compute 1/(319\u03c0): 1/(319 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(1003.7844) \u2248 0.000996, which is approximately 0.000996, which is greater than 0.0001. Wait, that's not correct. Wait, 0.000996 is 0.000996, which is 0.000996, which is less than 0.001, but greater than 0.0001. So, x = 1/(319\u03c0) is approximately 0.000996, which is within the interval. Similarly, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000) \u2248 0.0001, but since it's 1/(3183\u03c0), which is slightly larger than 0.0001. Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0: 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.1416 \u2248 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, 3183 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0928, so total \u2248 318.3 + 127.32 + 5.0928 \u2248 450.7128, so total \u2248 9549 + 450.7128 \u2248 9999.7128. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.7128 \u2248 0.0001000028, which is just slightly above 0.0001. Since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is just above 0.0001, which is acceptable. Similarly, x = 1/(319\u03c0) is approximately 0.000996, which is less than 0.001, so it's acceptable. Therefore, both endpoints n=319 and n=3183 give x within the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, the count remains 2865. Wait, but let me think again: when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.000996, which is less than 0.001, so it's inside the interval. When n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001000028, which is just above 0.0001, so it's also inside the interval. Therefore, both n=319 and n=3183 are included. So, the total number of intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. I think that's correct. But let me check with another approach. Alternatively, the function y = sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. The number of oscillations increases as x approaches 0. The interval (0.0001, 0.001) is from x=0.0001 to x=0.001, which is a range of 0.0009. To find how many times the sine function oscillates in this interval, we can consider how many periods of sin(1/x) are there in this interval. The function sin(1/x) has a period of 2\u03c0/(1/x) = 2\u03c0x. Wait, no, the period of sin(k/x) is 2\u03c0/(k/x) = 2\u03c0x/k. Wait, actually, the period T of sin(1/x) can be found by setting 1/(x + T) = 1/x + 2\u03c0, which would give T = 1/(1/x + 2\u03c0) - x. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, the number of zeros of sin(1/x) in the interval (a, b) is equal to the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (a, b). Which is exactly what I did earlier. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n where 1/(n\u03c0) is between a and b. So, solving for n, as I did, gives n between 1/(b\u03c0) and 1/(a\u03c0). Since a=0.0001 and b=0.001, 1/(b\u03c0)=1000/\u03c0\u2248318.309, and 1/(a\u03c0)=10000/\u03c0\u22483183.098. So, n must be from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 +1 =2865. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning.\n</think>\n\nThe number of x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2865.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify x-intercepts condition:** The x-intercepts occur where sin(1/x) = 0.

Each of these integers corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2865. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I found that n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct. So, I think my answer is 2865. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Each n gives a distinct x-intercept in the interval, so the total number is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

    "text": " The smallest integer greater than 318.309 is 319, and the largest integer less than 3183.098 is 3183. So, n can take integer values from 319 up to 3183. Now, to find the number of integers in this range, we can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add one (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 integers n between 319 and 3183, inclusive. Each of these n values corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, the number of x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2865. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with the inequalities: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n, I correctly inverted the inequalities to find n must be between approximately 318.309 and 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1, so 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. So, yeah, the answer should be 2865 x-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integers n. Solving for x gives x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need to find n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. This simplifies to 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. Thus, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

    "text": " The smallest integer greater than 318.309 is 319, and the largest integer less than 3183.098 is 3183. Now, to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, 3183 - 318 = 2865, then 2865 + 1 = 2866. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check that again. If n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the range for n. Let's double-check the inequalities. When x = 0.0001, 1/x = 10000, and when x = 0.001, 1/x = 1000. So, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, meaning n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which implies 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098. Since n is an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, yes, 2865 x-intercepts. Wait, but let me think again. When x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so the function oscillates more and more rapidly. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is from 1e-4 to 1e-3, 1/x goes from 1000 to 10000. So, the number of zeros should be roughly the number of times 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. The number of multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000 is approximately (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0, which is about 9000/3.1416 \u2248 2866. But since we're dealing with integers, the exact count is 2865. Hmm, but wait, when I calculated 3183 - 319 + 1, I got 2865, but the approximate value was 2866. Maybe I made a mistake in the exact calculation. Let me check: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 is 2865. So, that's correct. Alternatively, sometimes when counting inclusive integers, it's better to think of it as n_max - n_min + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not missing any intercepts. For example, when n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.0) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Similarly, when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, but wait, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.0, so x \u2248 0.0001, but our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.0001, so x must be greater than 0.0001. So, does x = 1/(3183\u03c0) equal exactly 0.0001? Let me check: 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000.0008, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099999, which is just slightly less than 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the maximum n is such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, the maximum integer n is 3183, but since x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099999 < 0.0001, it's not included. Therefore, the maximum n should be 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000 - \u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, but wait, that might not be accurate. Let me compute 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 3182 * 3 = 9546, 3182 * 0.1416 \u2248 3182 * 0.1 = 318.2, 3182 * 0.04 = 127.28, 3182 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0912, so total \u2248 9546 + 318.2 + 127.28 + 5.0912 \u2248 9546 + 450.5712 \u2248 9996.5712. So, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9996.5712, so x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.5712 \u2248 0.000100034, which is just over 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100034, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. Wait, but earlier I thought n goes up to 3183, but since 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.0008, so x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, the maximum n is 3182. Similarly, the minimum n is 319, because when n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.0) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Wait, but 0.000997 is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3182. Therefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 is 2864. Wait, that's different from before. Now I'm confused. Let me double-check.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which is n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n can be from 319 to 3183 inclusive. But when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100034 > 0.0001. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3182. Therefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, which is correct?\n\nLet me think again. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, if a = 319 and b = 3182, then the count is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863. Then add 1: 2864. So, 2864 integers. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n could go up to 3183, but since x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, it's excluded, so n only goes up to 3182. So, the correct count is 2864.\n\nBut now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 2865, but now it's 2864. Let me verify with specific examples.\n\nTake n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1003 \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nTake n = 3182: x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.57 \u2248 0.000100034, which is greater than 0.0001, so included.\n\nTake n = 3183: x \u2248 0.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so excluded.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of terms is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to see if my formula is correct. Suppose I have n from 2 to 5 inclusive. The numbers are 2,3,4,5. That's 4 numbers. Using the formula: 5 - 2 + 1 = 4, which is correct. So, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, in this case, it's 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, I must have made a mistake earlier when I included n = 3183, but since x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, it's not included. So, the correct number is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865, but since n only goes up to 3182, it's 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the number of zeros between 1/x = 1000 and 1/x = 10000. The number of zeros is the number of times 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0 in that interval. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.309 < n < 3183.098. So, n can be from 319 to 3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099999 < 0.0001, so excluded. Therefore, n goes up to 3182.\n\nSo, number of n is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but I'm now getting two different answers: 2864 and 2865. I need to resolve this discrepancy.\n\nLet me compute 3183 - 319 + 1: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865.\n\nBut since n=3183 is excluded, the correct upper limit is 3182, so 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nSo, the correct number is 2864.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from whether the interval is open or closed. The problem states the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. So, we need to ensure that x=1/(n\u03c0) is strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001.\n\nSo, for x > 0.0001: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x \u2248 0.000099999 < 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so n=3183 is excluded, so maximum n is 3182.\n\nSimilarly, for x < 0.001: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n starts at 319.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, number of terms is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with specific values:\n\nn=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000997 < 0.001, so included.\n\nn=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100034 > 0.0001, so included.\n\nn=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099999 < 0.0001, excluded.\n\nSo, the count is from n=319 to n=3182, which is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought about the interval for 1/x being (1000, 10000), the number of zeros would be the number of integers between 1000 and 10000 divided by \u03c0, which is approximately (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 \u2248 9000/3.1416 \u2248 2866. But since we're dealing with integers, it's 2866, but since we're excluding the endpoints, perhaps it's 2865 or 2864. But according to the precise calculation, it's 2864.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute it as floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0) + 1.\n\nSo, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so floor(10000/\u03c0) = 3183.\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so ceil(1000/\u03c0) = 319.\n\nSo, number of n is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nBut as we saw, n=3183 gives x \u2248 0.000099999 < 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the correct number is 2865 - 1 = 2864.\n\nSo, the formula gives 2865, but since n=3183 is excluded, we subtract 1, giving 2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. The number of zeros is the number of times 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1000 \u2264 n\u03c0 \u2264 10000. But since the interval is open, x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001, so 1/x cannot be exactly 1000 or 10000. Therefore, n\u03c0 must be strictly between 1000 and 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which is the same as before. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, but n=3183 gives 1/x \u2248 10000.0008, which is just over 10000, so 1/x cannot be equal to exactly 10000, but n=3183 gives 1/x \u2248 10000.0008, which is beyond 10000, so x \u2248 0.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so excluded. Therefore, n must be up to 3182.\n\nSo, the number of n is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because when I use the formula floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0) + 1, I get 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865, but since n=3183 is excluded, it's 2864.\n\nSo, the answer is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. The function y = sin(1/x) has a zero whenever 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). The interval for x is (0.0001, 0.001), which is equivalent to (1/10000, 1/1000). So, 1/(n\u03c0) must be in (1/10000, 1/1000). Therefore, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, as before. So, n must be in (1000/\u03c0, 10000/\u03c0), which is approximately (318.309, 3183.098). So, n can be 319, 320, ..., 3183. But as we saw, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099999 < 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nSo, the number of n is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the function y = sin(1/x) crosses the x-axis 2864 times between x=0.0001 and x=0.001.\n</think>\n\nThe function \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) has x-intercepts where \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\). This occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for integer \\( n \\), so \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we determine the range of \\( n \\) such that \\( 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\). This simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n1000 < n\\pi < 10000\n\\]\n\nDividing by \\( \\pi \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1000}{\\pi} < n < \\frac{10000}{\\pi}\n\\]\n\nApproximating:\n\n\\[\n318.309 < n < 3183.098\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( n \\) ranges from 319 to 3182 (since \\( n = 3183 \\) gives \\( x \\) just below 0.0001, which is excluded). The number of integers in this range is:\n\n\\[\n3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\(\\boxed{2864}\\)."
