Wait, but just to make sure, let me think about the function y = sin(1/x). As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, and sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly between -1 and 1. So, near x=0.0001, which is 1e-4, 1/x is 10000, so sin(1/x) is oscillating rapidly. But in our interval, from x=0.0001 to x=0.001, which is 1e-4 to 1e-3, 1/x goes from 10000 down to 1000. So, sin(1/x) will cross zero each time 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0. So, each time 1/x = n\u03c0, which is when x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001). Which, as we found, is n from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 2865 zeros.

Wait, but let me check that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, 2865 x-intercepts. Hmm, that seems like a lot, but considering that as x approaches 0, the function oscillates infinitely many times, but in this interval, it's a finite number. So, 2865 seems plausible. Wait, but let me think again: for each n, there's exactly one x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, the number of such x in (0.0001, 0.001) is the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in that interval. So, n must satisfy 1/(0.001) > n\u03c0 > 1/(0.0001). Wait, that's another way to write it. So, 1000 > n\u03c0 > 10000. Therefore, n must satisfy 10000/\u03c0 < n < 1000/\u03c0. Wait, no, that's not right.

Let's compute that: 318\u03c0 \u2248 318 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477796 18\u03c0 \u2248 56.548667 So total \u2248 942.477796 + 56.548667 \u2248 999.026463 So, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/999.026463 \u2248 0.001001001, which is just over 0.001, so it's outside the interval (0.0001, 0.001).

Therefore, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, giving 2865 x-intercepts. So, I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me consider if there's any possibility of missing some intercepts or counting extra.

Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000031, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included. What about n=3184? Let's see: 3184\u03c0 \u2248 3184 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796 184\u03c0 \u2248 184 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 180\u03c0 \u2248 565.48667 4\u03c0 \u2248 12.56637 565.48667 + 12.56637 \u2248 578.05304 So, total 3184\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796 + 578.05304 \u2248 10002.831 So, 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/10002.831 \u2248 0.0000999715, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. Therefore, n=3184 gives x \u2248 0.0000999715, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the upper bound for n is indeed 3183.

Wait, but earlier I thought n must be greater than approximately 318.309, so n=319 is the first integer. But if n=318 gives x\u22480.00099982, which is less than 0.001, but wait, 0.00099982 is less than 0.001? Wait, no, 0.00099982 is 0.00099982, which is less than 0.001. Wait, but 0.00099982 is 0.00099982, which is 0.00099982, which is less than 0.001. So, x=0.00099982 is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, why did I set n starting at 319? Because when I solved 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, I got n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. But wait, when n=318, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099982, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Hmm, so perhaps my initial calculation was slightly off. Let me re-examine the inequality. We have 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, so n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319.

If n=318, then 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099982, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, why did I get n > 318.309? Because 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=319 is the first integer. But n=318 gives x\u22480.00099982, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, perhaps my initial inequality was correct, but n=318 still gives x within the interval. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inequality direction. Let me re-express the inequality:\n\nWe have x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < x < 0.001.\n\nSince x = 1/(n\u03c0), we can write:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nTaking reciprocals (and remembering that flipping inequalities when taking reciprocals because all terms are positive):\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing all parts by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nCalculating:\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309\n\n10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098.\n\nTherefore, n can be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nWait, but earlier I saw that n=318 gives x\u22480.00099982, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, why does the inequality say n must be greater than 318.309, which would exclude n=318? Because when n=318, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099982 < 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, perhaps the inequality is not strict? Wait, let's think carefully.\n\nThe inequality is 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which implies n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309.\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319.\n\nBut when n=318, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099982 < 0.001, so it's included.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory.

So total \u2248 954 + 31.8 + 13.22 \u2248 1000.02. So, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/1000.02 \u2248 0.00099998, which is less than 0.001. So, it's included. Therefore, n=318 gives x\u22480.00099998, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Therefore, my earlier conclusion that n must be greater than 318.309 is correct, but n=318 is greater than 318.309? Wait, no, 318 is less than 318.309. So, n=318 is less than 318.309, which would imply that 1/(318\u03c0) > 0.001, but that's not the case. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inequality.\n\nWait, let's go back.\n\nWe have 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, so n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309.\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319.\n\nBut when n=318, which is less than 318.309, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099998 < 0.001, which contradicts the inequality because n=318 < 318.309, but 1/(n\u03c0) is still less than 0.001.\n\nWait, that can't be. Let me check the math again.\n\nWait, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309.\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.309, meaning n=319 is the first integer.\n\nBut when n=318, which is less than 318.309, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099998 < 0.001, which is still within the interval. So, why does the inequality say n must be greater than 318.309? Because if n=318, which is less than 318.309, 1/(n\u03c0) is still less than 0.001. So, perhaps the inequality is not correctly applied.\n\nWait, let's think again.\n\nWe have 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nSo, solving for n:\n\nn > 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319.\n\nBut when n=318, which is less than 318.309, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099998 < 0.001, so it's still included. So, this suggests that n can be as low as 318, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, which would exclude n=318.\n\nThis seems contradictory. Let me check with exact numbers.\n\nLet me compute 1/(318\u03c0):\n\n318\u03c0 \u2248 318 * 3.141592653589793 \u2248 318 * 3 = 954, 318 * 0.141592653589793 \u2248 318 * 0.1 = 31.8, 318 * 0.041592653589793 \u2248 13.22. So total \u2248 954 + 31.8 + 13.22 \u2248 1000.02.

So, perhaps the inequality is correct, but n=318 is allowed because 1/(318\u03c0) is less than 0.001. Wait, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is less than that, but 1/(318\u03c0) is still less than 0.001. So, perhaps the inequality is not tight. Let me think differently.\n\nLet me consider that for n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099998, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n=318 is valid. Therefore, my initial calculation that n starts at 319 was incorrect. It should start at n=318. Wait, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, which would mean n=319 is the first integer. But in reality, n=318 gives x=0.00099998, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Therefore, perhaps the correct range is n from 318 up to 3183, inclusive. Let me check that.\n\nIf n=318, x\u22480.00099998 < 0.001, included.\n\nn=319, x\u22480.0009965 < 0.001, included.\n\n...\n\nn=3183, x\u22480.0001000031 > 0.0001, included.\n\nn=3184, x\u22480.0000999715 < 0.0001, excluded.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 318 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3183 - 318 + 1 = 2866.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier count. So, which is correct?\n\nLet me recast the problem.\n\nWe have x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < x < 0.001.\n\nx = 1/(n\u03c0), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nTaking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities):\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDivide by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nWhich is approximately:\n\n318.309 < n < 3183.098\n\nTherefore, n must be an integer such that 318.309 < n < 3183.098.\n\nSo, n can be 319, 320, ..., 3183.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nBut earlier, I saw that n=318 gives x\u22480.00099998, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, why isn't n=318 included?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inequality.\n\nLet me solve 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 again.\n\nFirst inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0)\n\nWhich implies 1/(0.0001) > n\u03c0\n\nWhich is 10000 > n\u03c0\n\nSo, n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098\n\nSecond inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nWhich implies 1/(0.001) > n\u03c0\n\nWhich is 1000 > n\u03c0\n\nSo, n < 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309\n\nWait, that can't be, because 1000 > n\u03c0 implies n < 318.309.\n\nBut that contradicts the first inequality, which says n < 3183.098.\n\nWait, no, I think I messed up the direction of the inequality when taking reciprocals.\n\nLet me do it step by step.\n\nFrom 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0):\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0 (positive, so inequality remains):\n\n0.0001 * n\u03c0 < 1\n\nWhich is n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001 = 10000\n\nSo, n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001:\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0:\n\n1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0\n\nWhich is n\u03c0 > 1000\n\nSo, n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309\n\nTherefore, combining both:\n\n318.309 < n < 3183.098\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098.\n\nTherefore, n is integer from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nTherefore, the initial calculation was correct, and n starts at 319, not 318.\n\nBut wait, when n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099998 < 0.001, so it's included in the interval. So, why does the inequality say n must be greater than 318.309, which would exclude n=318?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the second inequality.\n\nWait, from 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, we have n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309.\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=319 is the first integer.\n\nBut when n=318, which is less than 318.309, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099998 < 0.001, so it's included. Therefore, the inequality is correct, but n=318 is allowed because 1/(318\u03c0) is still less than 0.001.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me think differently.\n\nThe function sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. Between any two points close to 0, it oscillates infinitely many times. But in our case, we're looking at x between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a finite interval, albeit very close to 0.\n\nEach x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0), where n is a positive integer. So, for each n, we have an x-intercept at x=1/(n\u03c0).\n\nWe need to find all n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\n1/(0.001) > n\u03c0 > 1/(0.0001)\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000 > n\u03c0 > 10000\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nTaking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities):\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nWhich is approximately:\n\n318.309 < n < 3183.098\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098.\n\nTherefore, n can be 319, 320, ..., 3183.\n\nThus, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nTherefore, the correct number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nI think earlier confusion was due to miscalculating the inequalities, but after carefully going through each step, the correct count is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for each integer n. To find how many such x-intercepts lie in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), we solve for n:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n318.309 < n < 3183.098\n\nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

But let me check if there's a possibility that some x's might be outside the interval. For example, when n=3183, x is just over 0.0001, so included. When n=3184, x would be 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3184 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000.0 something), which would be less than 0.0001, so outside the interval.

The number of oscillations increases as x approaches 0. Between x = a and x = b, where 0 < a < b, the number of zeros of sin(1/x) is approximately (1/(a\u03c0) - 1/(b\u03c0)). Because each zero occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0), so the number of zeros between a and b is the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is between a and b. Which is the same as n between 1/(b\u03c0) and 1/(a\u03c0). Since n must be integers, the number of such n is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)). Wait, but in our case, a = 0.0001 and b = 0.001. So, 1/(a\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098 and 1/(b\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. So, the number of integers n between 318.309 and 3183.098 is floor(3183.098) - ceil(318.309) +1.

Therefore, the final answer is 2865.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. I just thought of something. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. So, between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a very small interval near zero, the function oscillates infinitely many times? Wait, no, because we're dealing with a finite interval. But wait, in our calculation, we found a finite number of zeros, 2865. But actually, as x approaches zero from the positive side, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates between -1 and 1 infinitely often. So, in any interval (a, b) where a > 0, but as a approaches zero, the number of zeros becomes infinite. Wait, but in our case, the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is a fixed interval, not approaching zero. So, in that interval, how many zeros does sin(1/x) have? Each zero occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0), so as n increases, x decreases towards zero. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), the smallest x is 0.0001, so the largest n is such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which gives n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183. Similarly, the largest x is 0.001, so the smallest n is such that 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which gives n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309, so n starts at 319. Therefore, the number of zeros is the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that seems correct.

So, the answer is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me recompute 1/(0.0001\u03c0): 1/(0.0001 * \u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the largest integer n is 3183. Similarly, 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319.

The function sin(1/x) has a vertical asymptote at x=0, and as x approaches zero from the positive side, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates between -1 and 1 infinitely many times. However, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a finite interval, the function will oscillate a finite number of times, but still potentially a large number of times.

Wait, but just to make sure, perhaps I should consider whether n=3183 is the correct upper limit. Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0) more accurately. Let me use a calculator for better precision. 3183 * \u03c0 = 3183 * 3.141592653589793. Let's compute:\n\n3183 * 3 = 9549\n\n3183 * 0.141592653589793 \u2248 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3\n\n3183 * 0.041592653589793 \u2248 Let's compute 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32\n\n3183 * 0.001592653589793 \u2248 Approximately 3183 * 0.001 = 3.183, and 3183 * 0.000592653589793 \u2248 ~1.888.\n\nSo, adding up: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62\n\n445.62 + 3.183 = 448.803\n\n448.803 + 1.888 \u2248 450.691\n\nSo total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9549 + 450.691 \u2248 9999.691\n\nTherefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.691 \u2248 0.0001000031, which is indeed just over 0.0001, so included.\n\nSimilarly, n=3184: x=1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3184 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10002.0) \u2248 0.00009998, which is less than 0.0001, so not included. Therefore, n=3184 would give x \u2248 0.00009998, which is below 0.0001, so not in the interval. Therefore, the maximum n is 3183, as previously determined.\n\nSimilarly, n=318 gives x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.0) \u2248 0.001, but since our interval is open, x must be less than 0.001, so n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.001003, which is greater than 0.001, so not included. Therefore, the minimum n is 319.\n\nWait, let me compute 1/(318\u03c0): 318\u03c0 \u2248 318 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 1000.0 (since 318*3=954, 318*0.14159265\u224845.0, totaling \u22481000.0). So, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.001, which is the upper bound, but since the interval is open, we don't include x=0.001, so n=318 is excluded. Therefore, the smallest n is 319, which gives x\u22480.00099784, which is less than 0.001, so included.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that when I subtract 319 from 3183, I'm not making a mistake. 3183 - 319: Let's compute 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again: the function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0, which is the case here since x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is very close to zero. So, the function crosses the x-axis each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, which corresponds to each n increasing by 1. So, the number of zeros should be approximately the number of times 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000, which is from 1/0.001 to 1/0.0001.\n\nWait, 1/x when x is 0.001 is 1000, and when x is 0.0001, it's 10000. So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000 as x goes from 0.001 down to 0.0001. So, the number of zeros of sin(1/x) in this interval is the number of times 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000.\n\nSo, the number of zeros would be the number of integers n such that n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000 \u2264 n\u03c0 \u2264 10000.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 \u2264 n \u2264 10000/\u03c0.\n\nCalculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184\n\nAnd 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183, inclusive.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nSo, that matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\). This occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for some integer \\( n \\), which implies \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n\nWe need \\( x \\) to be within the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\). Therefore, we solve the inequalities:\n\\[ 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\]\n\nRewriting these inequalities:\n\\[ 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\implies n < \\frac{1}{0.0001\\pi} \\approx 3183.098 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\implies n > \\frac{1}{0.001\\pi} \\approx 318.309 \\]\n\nThus, \\( n \\) must be an integer such that \\( 319 \\leq n \\leq 3183 \\).\n\nThe number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is calculated as:\n\\[ 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts is \\(\\boxed{2865}\\)."
