    "text": " 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) Calculating that: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.3098 So, n must be greater than approximately 318.3098 and less than approximately 3183.098. Since n has to be an integer, n ranges from the smallest integer greater than 318.3098 to the largest integer less than 3183.098. The smallest integer greater than 318.3098 is 319, and the largest integer less than 3183.098 is 3183. Now, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, actually, let me think again. If n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n in that range, which would correspond to 2865 x-intercepts. But wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the interval for x is from 0.0001 to 0.001, and x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, when n increases, x decreases. So, the smallest x is 0.0001, which corresponds to the largest n, and the largest x is 0.001, which corresponds to the smallest n. So, as n increases, x decreases, so the intercepts get closer and closer to zero as n increases. Therefore, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) where n is between 319 and 3183 inclusive. So, the number of intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, 2865 intercepts. But wait, let me check if 1/(319\u03c0) is greater than 0.001 and 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001. Let me compute 1/(319\u03c0): 1/(319 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(1003.0) \u2248 0.000997, which is approximately 0.001, but just a bit less. Similarly, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, we need to check if 1/(3183\u03c0) is indeed greater than 0.0001. Wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10000, which is exactly 0.0001. But the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. Therefore, n must satisfy 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0). So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. Now, let me count how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The formula is (last - first) + 1. So, (3183 - 319) + 1 = 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, 2865 intercepts. Wait, but let me make sure that 1/(319\u03c0) is less than 0.001. Let me compute 1/(319\u03c0): 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 1003.0, so 1/1003 \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001. So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000997 < 0.001, so that's within the interval. Similarly, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/10000 = 0.0001, but since the interval is open, we need to check if 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but exactly, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) = 0.0001 exactly. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, we exclude the endpoints. So, x must be greater than 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001. Therefore, n must be less than 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n can be up to 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound of the interval, but since the interval is open, we need to exclude n=3183 because x=1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001 is not included. Wait, so does that mean n goes up to 3182? Let me check: 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000 - \u03c0) \u2248 slightly more than 0.0001. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 + \u03b5, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. Similarly, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000997 < 0.001, so it's included. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, but since 1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001 is excluded, we need to check if n=3183 is included or not. Wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is not in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), so n=3183 corresponds to x=0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) is just above 0.0001. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but since 1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001 is excluded, we have to take n up to 3182. Wait, no, let me think again. The inequality is 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, solving for n: 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0). So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n can be from 319 up to 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001 is not included, so n can go up to 3183 only if 1/(3183\u03c0) > 0.0001. But 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001 because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) is approximately 0.00010003, which is just above 0.0001. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, 2864 intercepts. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, where did I go wrong? Let me double-check. The original inequalities: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098, so n > 318.3098, so the smallest integer n is 319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n < 3183.098, so the largest integer n is 3183. But since 1/(3183\u03c0) = 0.0001, which is excluded, n must be less than 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) is excluded, so we need to check if n=3183 is included or not. Since x must be greater than 0.0001, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, so n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n can be 3183 only if 1/(3183\u03c0) > 0.0001, but 1/(3183\u03c0) = 0.0001 exactly, so it's not greater, so n must be less than 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183 only if 1/(3183\u03c0) > 0.0001, which it's not. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, which one is correct? Let me do the calculation again: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, 2864. Therefore, the correct number is 2864. But wait, let me check with specific numbers. Let's say n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.000997, which is less than 0.001, so included. n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.00010003, which is just above 0.0001, so included. n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001, which is excluded. So, n goes from 319 to 3182, inclusive. So, the count is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Therefore, the final answer is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integers n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). To find the number of x-intercepts in (0.0001, 0.001), we solve 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, leading to 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3182. The number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 2864.\n\n\\boxed{2864}"

Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, no, let me think. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me calculate that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n, which correspond to 2865 x-intercepts in the given interval. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake with the inequalities. Let me verify the bounds for n. The lower bound was n > 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.3098, so the smallest integer n is 319. The upper bound was n < 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so the largest integer n is 3183. So yes, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Now, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 x-intercepts. Wait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure that each n corresponds to a unique x in the interval. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), as n increases, x decreases, which makes sense because as x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a small interval near zero, the function oscillates a lot, leading to many x-intercepts. Each n gives a distinct x, so each n from 319 to 3183 inclusive gives a unique x in the interval. Therefore, the total number of x-intercepts is indeed 2865. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Solving for x gives x = 1/(n\u03c0).

Since n must be an integer, n can take integer values from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to count how many integers are in this range. The smallest integer n is 319, and the largest is 3183. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, starting from the inequalities:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nTaking reciprocals (and remembering that reversing inequalities when taking reciprocals because all terms are positive):\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nThen, dividing each part by \u03c0:\n\n1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.3098 < n < 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.098\n\nSo, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The count is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again:\n\n3183 minus 319 is 2864, then adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct.\n\nHmm, but wait, I should make sure that 1/(n\u03c0) is indeed within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Let me check the endpoints:\n\nFor n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1004.3) \u2248 0.0009957, which is approximately 0.0009957, which is greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001, so that's good.\n\nFor n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so 0.0001 is excluded. Wait, so does x = 1/(3183\u03c0) equal exactly 0.0001? Let me check:\n\n3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.1416 \u2248 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, 3183 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0928. Adding those: 9549 + 318.3 = 9867.3 + 127.32 = 9994.62 + 5.0928 \u2248 9999.7128. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.7128 \u2248 0.0001000028, which is just slightly above 0.0001. But since our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, does x = 0.0001000028 count? It's greater than 0.0001, so yes, it's included. Similarly, for n=3183, x is just above 0.0001, so it's included. So, n=3183 is acceptable.\n\nSimilarly, for n=319, x\u22480.0009957, which is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nWait, but when I calculated n=3183, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000028, which is just barely above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, yes, n=3183 is included.\n\nSimilarly, n=318: x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.8) \u2248 0.0009992, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Wait, but earlier I had n starting at 319. Let me check n=318:\n\nx=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.8) \u2248 0.0009992, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. But according to my earlier calculation, n must be greater than ~318.3098, so the next integer is 319. So, n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009992, which is within the interval. But wait, that's conflicting with my earlier conclusion that n starts at 319. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the lower bound.\n\nLet me re-express the inequalities:\n\nWe have 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nTaking reciprocals:\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.3098 and less than 3183.098. Therefore, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest is 3183. So, n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0) \u22480.0009992, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Wait, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.3098, so n=318 is less than that, so it's not included. Wait, but 318 is less than 318.3098, so n=318 is not allowed, but n=319 is the first integer greater than 318.3098.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nn=318: 318 > 318.3098? No, 318 is less than 318.3098, so n=318 is not in the solution set. Therefore, the smallest n is 319.\n\nSimilarly, n=3183: 3183 < 3183.098, so it's included because 3183 is less than 3183.098. So, n=3183 is included.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 +1.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\n2864 +1 = 2865\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept in the interval. Since sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches zero, but in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a small interval near zero, the function will cross the x-axis each time 1/x increases by \u03c0. So, each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept in that interval.\n\nTherefore, the total number is 2865.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap:\n\n1. sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0).\n\n2. Find x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\n3. Solve for n: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so n is between ~318.31 and ~3183.098.\n\n4. n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\n5. Number of integers: 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nYes, that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in this reasoning.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) crosses the x-axis when 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0, i.e., at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer n. To find the number of such x in (0.0001, 0.001), we solve 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, leading to n between approximately 318.31 and 3183.098. Thus, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The count is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183, inclusive, I can subtract 319 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, 3183 - 319 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865.

So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. Subtracting 319 from 3183 gives 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. That seems right.

Since n must be an integer, n can take integer values from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the numbers: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 = 2864; 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. First, let's verify the bounds for n. The lower bound was 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309, so n must be greater than that, so the smallest integer n is 319. The upper bound was 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so the largest integer n is 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319 first: 3183 - 300 = 2883; 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, that's 2865 integers. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Hmm, that seems correct, but let me think again. Each x-intercept corresponds to a unique n, and since n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, the count is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Alternatively, I can think of it as starting from n=1, up to n=3183, which gives 3183 x-intercepts, and subtracting the number of x-intercepts before n=319, which is 318. So, 3183 - 318 = 2865. That matches. So, yeah, I think 2865 is the correct number of x-intercepts in that interval. I don't think I made a mistake here, but let me consider if there's any possibility I missed something. For example, does 1/(n\u03c0) ever equal exactly 0.0001 or 0.001? Let's check. If 1/(n\u03c0) = 0.0001, then n = 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, which is not an integer, so the closest integer is 3183, which is just below 0.0001. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) = 0.001 gives n \u2248 318.309, which is not an integer, so the closest integer is 319, which is just above 0.001. So, the endpoints are not included, which is consistent with the interval being open: (0.0001, 0.001). So, that means we don't include n=318 or n=3183, but wait, earlier I thought n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. Wait, but 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.001002, which is just above 0.001, so it's outside the interval. So, n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000975, which is less than 0.001, so that's inside the interval. Similarly, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999, which is just below 0.0001, so it's inside the interval. Wait, hold on, that seems contradictory. Let me compute 1/(319\u03c0): 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 1003. So, 1/1003 \u2248 0.000997, which is approximately 0.001, but less than 0.001. So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's inside the interval. Similarly, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183*3.1416) \u2248 1/10000 \u2248 0.0001, but slightly less, so it's inside the interval. So, n=319 gives x\u22480.000997 which is within (0.0001, 0.001), and n=3183 gives x\u22480.0000999, which is just above 0.0001. Wait, 0.0000999 is actually 0.0000999, which is 9.99e-5, which is less than 0.0001 (which is 1e-4). So, 0.0000999 is less than 0.0001, so it's actually outside the interval. Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0) more accurately. 3183 * \u03c0: 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 3000*\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 183*\u03c0\u2248574.7853, so total \u22489424.77796 + 574.7853 \u2248 9999.56326. So, 1/9999.56326 \u2248 0.0001000044. So, that's approximately 0.0001000044, which is just above 0.0001. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000044, which is just above 0.0001, so it's inside the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.098) \u2248 0.0009969, which is less than 0.001, so it's inside the interval. So, both n=319 and n=3183 give x-values inside the interval. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183, inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0).

Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. To find the number of integers from a to b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. But here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Each of these n corresponds to an x-intercept in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. When I had 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, I solved for n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n starts at 319. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 gives n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n ends at 3183. So, the number of integers is indeed 3183 - 318 = 2865? Wait, no, because 3183 - 319 + 1 is 2865. Yeah, that seems right. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me check if 1/(319\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001 and 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.001. Let me compute 1/(319\u03c0): 1/(319 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(1003.08) \u2248 0.000997, which is approximately 0.001, but since 0.000997 is less than 0.001, wait, that's not right. Wait, 1/(n\u03c0) needs to be greater than 0.0001, so when n=319, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000997, which is greater than 0.0001, so that's okay. But wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000) \u2248 0.0001, which is equal to the lower bound, but since the interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), we don't include x=0.0001, so we need to check if n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) which is approximately 0.0001, but since it's open, maybe n=3183 is not included? Wait, let me see: 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, so if x=0.0001 is excluded, then n=3183 would give x=1/(3183\u03c0) which is just above 0.0001? Wait, no, 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, x=0.0001 is excluded, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001 when n=3183\u03c0=10000, which isn't exactly the case because \u03c0 is irrational, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001, right? Wait, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 let's compute that: 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77, 183\u03c0 \u2248 574.53, so total \u2248 9424.77 + 574.53 \u2248 9999.3, so 1/(9999.3) \u2248 0.000100007, which is just over 0.0001. Wait, that can't be right because 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 is slightly less than 10000, 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly more than 0.0001. So, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100007, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, for n=319, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.08) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Therefore, n=319 gives x\u22480.000997, which is within (0.0001, 0.001), and n=3183 gives x\u22480.000100007, which is also within the interval. So, both n=319 and n=3183 are included. Therefore, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but let me confirm the subtraction: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 gives 2865. So, the total number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's correct.

Let's compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n, each corresponding to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, that seems correct, but let me just think about it another way to confirm. The interval for x is from 0.0001 to 0.001. So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. So, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. The zeros of sin(1/x) occur when 1/x = n\u03c0, so n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000. Therefore, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing all parts by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. As before, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Yep, that seems consistent. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0, i.e., at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. Within the interval (0.0001, 0.001), 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. Thus, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, leading to n between approximately 319 and 3183. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

Now, I need to count how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is given by b - a + 1. So here, a = 319 and b = 3183. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Each of these n corresponds to an x-intercept in the given interval. Wait, but let me double-check if I included all the necessary values. The original inequalities were 0.0001 < x < 0.001. So, x must be strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. Therefore, when I substituted x = 1/(n\u03c0), I should ensure that 1/(n\u03c0) is strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. So, for the lower bound, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, the maximum n is 3183. Similarly, for the upper bound, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309, so the minimum n is 319. So, the range of n is from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which gives 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me think again. The function sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches zero, but in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a small interval near zero, how does the function behave? As x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000. So, sin(1/x) will oscillate between -1 and 1, with the number of oscillations decreasing as x increases. Each time 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0, the function crosses zero. So, the number of zeros should be approximately the number of times 1/x passes through n\u03c0 in the interval from 1000 to 10000. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Solving for n, we get n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, which is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that confirms the earlier calculation. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integers n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n gives 318.309 < n < 3183.098, so n ranges from 319 to 3183. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

Alternatively, I can think of it as the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 318 = 2865. Because from 1 to 3183 is 3183 numbers, and from 1 to 318 is 318 numbers, so subtracting gives 3183 - 318 = 2865. So, that confirms it.

Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I set sin(1/x) = 0, which gives 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). Then, substituting into the interval, I correctly transformed the inequalities into 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n, I correctly inverted the inequalities, remembering that dividing by a smaller number gives a larger result. So, n must be greater than 1/(0.001\u03c0) and less than 1/(0.0001\u03c0). Calculating those gave me approximately 318.3098 and 3183.098, which seems right because 1/\u03c0 is about 0.318, so 1000/\u03c0 is about 318, and 10000/\u03c0 is about 3183. Then, the range for n is from 319 to 3183. The number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, then adding 1 gives 2865.

Let's compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, let's confirm the inequalities: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, solving for n: 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0). Which is the same as 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1: 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, that's 2865 integers. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait a second, that seems correct, but let me think about the function's behavior. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. So, between 0.0001 and 0.001, which are both very small numbers, the function oscillates rapidly. Each oscillation crosses the x-axis twice, once going up and once going down. But wait, in my earlier reasoning, I only accounted for zeros where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs once per period, but actually, each period has two zeros. Hmm, no, wait. Let me clarify: The sine function has a period of 2\u03c0, and in each period, it crosses zero twice: once at the start and once halfway. But in the function sin(1/x), each zero crossing corresponds to a change in n. Wait, no, each n corresponds to a single zero crossing. Because for each integer n, 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). Each n gives exactly one x-intercept. So, the number of x-intercepts is equal to the number of integers n between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which we calculated as 2865. So, that should be correct. Alternatively, sometimes when dealing with oscillations, people might think about the number of periods, but in this case, each zero is a single point, so each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept.

So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309, so n starts at 319. Therefore, the number of n's is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but I just realized that 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000997, which is just below 0.001, so that's okay. And 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, which is the lower bound. So, x = 1/(319\u03c0) is just inside the interval (0.0001, 0.001), and x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is just at the lower end. So, yes, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, giving 2865 x-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). For x in (0.0001, 0.001), n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

Since n has to be an integer, n can take integer values from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the values: Number of intercepts = 3183 - 319 + 1 Let's compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864; then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with the inequalities: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, taking reciprocals (and remembering to flip the inequalities because reciprocals reverse the inequality for positive numbers), we get: 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001 Which simplifies to: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Then, dividing each part by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating these: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest is 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883; 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct. So, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait a second, that's a lot of intercepts. Let me think about the behavior of the function. As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly between -1 and 1. So, near x = 0, the function has infinitely many oscillations, hence infinitely many x-intercepts. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a finite interval, but very close to zero, the function still oscillates rapidly, leading to many x-intercepts. So, 2865 intercepts in that interval seems plausible. Let me check if I considered the endpoints correctly. The interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), so we don't include x = 0.0001 and x = 0.001. So, the x-intercepts must lie strictly between these two values. So, when I found n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) is between 0.0001 and 0.001, I correctly excluded n such that x equals exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. Therefore, the number of intercepts is indeed 2865. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of x-intercepts of \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we set \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\).

Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So here, a = 319 and b = 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 integer values of n, which correspond to 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The first inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098.

Since n has to be an integer, n can take integer values from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, plugging in a = 319 and b = 3183: Number of integers = 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, let me check that again. 3183 minus 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Each of these n values corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait a second, I should make sure that x = 1/(n\u03c0) is indeed within (0.0001, 0.001) for n from 319 to 3183. Let me check for n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.12) \u2248 0.000997, which is approximately 0.001, but just a bit less. Since 0.001 is the upper bound, and 0.000997 is less than 0.001, that's okay. Now, for n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) = 0.0001, which is exactly the lower bound. But since the interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), does x = 0.0001 count? No, because it's not included. So, we need to check if n = 3183 gives x = 1/(3183\u03c0) which is just slightly greater than 0.0001? Wait, let me calculate more accurately. 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000.0) exactly? Wait, no, because 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 10000.0. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, if x = 1/(n\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001 when n = 3183, then it's not included. So, does n start at 319 and go up to 3182? Wait, let me recast the inequalities more accurately. Let me solve for n in both inequalities again. First inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u2192 n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but since 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 exactly, which is not included in the interval. Therefore, n can only go up to 3182. Similarly, for the lower bound: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u2192 n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098. So, the smallest integer n is 319. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Now, let's calculate the number of integers between 319 and 3182 inclusive. Using the formula: 3182 - 319 + 1 = 3182 - 319 = 2863; 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, there are 2864 integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. Hmm, seems like I made a mistake in the initial calculation by including n = 3183, which gives x = 0.0001, which is not included. So, the correct number is 2864. Let me double-check this. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, from 319 to 3182: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 is 2864. Yes, that seems right. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each period of sin(1/x) corresponds to a zero crossing. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more frequently as x approaches 0. The number of zeros between two points x1 and x2 is roughly the difference in their 1/x values divided by \u03c0. So, the number of zeros N \u2248 (1/x1 - 1/x2)/\u03c0. Plugging in x1 = 0.0001 and x2 = 0.001: 1/x1 = 10000, 1/x2 = 1000. So, N \u2248 (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 = 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.198. Hmm, that's approximately 2866, but our exact calculation gave 2864. There's a slight discrepancy here. I think the reason is that the exact count needs to consider whether the endpoints are included or not. Since we're dealing with open intervals, we have to exclude the endpoints, which might account for the difference. So, perhaps 2864 is the correct exact count, while the approximation gives around 2866. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the exact calculation. Let me check again. Let's compute 1/(0.0001) = 10000, and 1/(0.001) = 1000. The number of zeros between 1000 and 10000 is the number of integers n where 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, the zeros occur at n\u03c0 where n is integer, so the number of zeros between a and b is the number of integers n such that a < n\u03c0 < b. So, in our case, the zeros occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0), so we need x in (0.0001, 0.001), which translates to 1/(n\u03c0) in that interval. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u2192 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000 \u2192 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. As before, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183. But since x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 is excluded, n goes up to 3182. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Alternatively, using the approximation method: the number of zeros is approximately (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 = 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.198, which is close to 2864. The difference is due to the fact that the exact count excludes the endpoints. So, the exact number is 2864. Therefore, the final answer is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. This gives x = 1/(n\u03c0).

Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again. Hmm, 3183 - 319 is actually 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. Let's double-check the substitution. So, x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is 1e-4 < x < 1e-3. Then, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, is 1/(3183\u03c0) greater than 0.0001? Let me check: 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183*3.1416) \u2248 1/10000 \u2248 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000, 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001. So, actually, 1/(3183\u03c0) is just below 0.0001, so x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is just below 0.0001, which is outside our interval. So, the maximum n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) is still greater than 0.0001 is when n is less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is just below 0.0001, which is outside the interval. So, actually, the smallest n is 319, but the largest n that satisfies x > 0.0001 is when 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n can be up to 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is just below 0.0001, which is outside the interval, so the largest n that gives x within the interval is n = 3183 - 1 = 3182? Wait, no, because x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so the largest n that gives x > 0.0001 is n = floor(1/(0.0001\u03c0)) - 1? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think differently. Since x must be greater than 0.0001, so 1/x < 10000, but 1/x must be greater than 1000, so 1000 < 1/x < 10000. So, n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000. Therefore, n must be between 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. But wait, let me check for n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. So, the largest n that gives x > 0.0001 is n=3183 -1=3182? Let's check: x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182*3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000 - a little), so it's slightly more than 0.0001. Yes, because 3182\u03c0 \u2248 10000 - 3.1416, so x \u2248 0.0001 + a bit. So, n can go up to 3182. Similarly, n starts at 319 because n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.14) \u2248 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Wait, but 0.0009968 is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Wait, no, 0.0009968 is 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, n=319 gives x\u22480.0009968, which is within (0.0001, 0.001). So, the smallest n is 319, and the largest n is 3182. Therefore, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 + 1 = 2864. Wait, so earlier I thought it was 2865, but now it's 2864. Hmm, where did I go wrong? Let me recast it. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, if a=319 and b=3182, then it's 3182 - 319 +1= 2864. So, the correct number is 2864. But wait, let's check with n=319: x\u22480.0009968, which is within the interval. n=3182: x\u22481/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.0001003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 +1=2864. So, the initial calculation was incorrect because I included n=3183, which gives x below 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the correct number is 2864. Alternatively, let's compute it as follows: The range of n is from ceiling(1000/\u03c0) to floor(10000/\u03c0). So, ceiling(318.309)=319, and floor(3183.098)=3183. But wait, earlier we saw that n=3183 gives x\u22480.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the upper limit should be floor(10000/\u03c0 - \u03b5), where \u03b5 is a small positive number, which would be 3182. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 +1=2864. Alternatively, another way: The number of zeros is the number of times 1/x crosses an integer multiple of \u03c0 in the interval (1000, 10000). So, the number of zeros is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0). So, floor(10000/\u03c0)=3183, ceil(1000/\u03c0)=319. So, 3183 - 319=2864. Wait, but floor(10000/\u03c0)=3183, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the number of zeros is floor(10000/\u03c0) -1 - ceil(1000/\u03c0) +1? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 <10000, which is equivalent to 1000/\u03c0 <n<10000/\u03c0. So, n must be from 319 to 3183, but n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the upper bound is n=3182. So, the number of integers is 3182 -319 +1=2864. So, the answer should be 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), which translates to 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Thus, n ranges from 319 to 3182, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\n\\boxed{2864}"

Since n has to be an integer, n ranges from the next integer after 318.3098, which is 319, up to the integer just below 3183.098, which is 3183. So, n = 319, 320, 321, ..., 3183. Now, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can use the formula: Number of terms = (Last term - First term) + 1 Plugging in the numbers: Number of terms = (3183 - 319) + 1 Let me compute 3183 - 319 first. 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864.

Similarly, 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098. So, n must be greater than 318.3098 and less than 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183.

Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So here, a = 319 and b = 3183. So, the number of x-intercepts would be 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864; then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. First, the lower bound: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183.

So, that's 2865 x-intercepts. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me think again. Each n corresponds to a unique x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, for each n from 319 to 3183, we have a distinct x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, the number of such n is indeed 2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. Let me check the endpoints again. If x is 0.0001, then 1/x is 10000, and if x is 0.001, then 1/x is 1000. So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. So, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0, i.e., when 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.

The smallest integer greater than 318.3098 is 319, and the largest integer less than 3183.098 is 3183. Now, to find how many integers are in this range, we can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add one (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 = 2864; 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, let me double-check that subtraction: 3183 - 319.

Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the given interval. Hmm, but wait a second, I should make sure that x = 1/(n\u03c0) is indeed within (0.0001, 0.001) for each of these n. Let me test the first n, which is 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.87) \u2248 0.000996, which is approximately 0.000996, which is greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. Similarly, for n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.05) \u2248 0.00009999, which is just slightly less than 0.0001. Wait, but our lower bound was 0.0001, so x must be greater than 0.0001. So, n=3183 gives x \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. Hmm, that means n can't be 3183 because x would be less than 0.0001. So, perhaps my earlier calculation was off by one. Let me re-examine the inequalities. We had 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, solving for n: For the lower bound: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.098, meaning the maximum integer n is 3183. But when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. Therefore, the maximum n should be such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, solving 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, the maximum integer n is 3183, but as we saw, that gives x just below 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3182. Let me check n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000 - \u03c0) \u2248 approximately 1/10000 \u2248 0.0001, but let's compute more accurately. 3182\u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.14159265 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's compute 3000*3.1416=9424.8, 182*3.1416\u2248182*3=546, 182*0.1416\u224825.8, so total \u2248546 +25.8=571.8, so total 9424.8 + 571.8 \u2248 9996.6. So, x=1/9996.6\u22480.000100034, which is just over 0.0001. So, x\u22480.000100034, which is within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n=3182 gives x\u22480.000100034, which is acceptable. Similarly, n=3183 gives x\u22480.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. Similarly, for the lower bound, n must be greater than 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248318.3098, so the smallest integer n is 319. So, now, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Now, let's compute the number of integers in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a +1. So, 3182 - 319 +1 = 3182 -319=2863; 2863 +1=2864. Therefore, there are 2864 x-intercepts. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but now it's 2864 because n=3183 is excluded. Let me verify this carefully. Let me compute 3182 - 319 +1. 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 is 2864. So, that's the correct count. To make sure, let's consider a smaller example. Suppose I have n from 5 to 8 inclusive. 5,6,7,8. That's 4 numbers. 8 -5 +1=4. Similarly, if I have n from 319 to 3182 inclusive, it's 3182 -319 +1=2864. So, that's correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but let me check another way. The function y=sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. The number of oscillations increases as x gets smaller. The interval from 0.0001 to 0.001 is from x=1e-4 to x=1e-3. The number of zeros of sin(1/x) between x=a and x=b is approximately the number of times 1/x crosses multiples of \u03c0 as x decreases from b to a. So, the number of zeros is roughly (1/(a\u03c0) - 1/(b\u03c0)) / \u03c0? Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, each zero occurs at x=1/(n\u03c0), so the number of zeros between a and b is the number of integers n such that 1/(b) < n\u03c0 < 1/a. So, n must satisfy 1/(b\u03c0) < n < 1/(a\u03c0). So, the number of integers n is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)). Let me compute that. Here, a=0.0001, b=0.001. So, 1/(a\u03c0)=1/(0.0001\u03c0)=10000/\u03c0\u22483183.098. So, floor(1/(a\u03c0))=3183. Similarly, 1/(b\u03c0)=1/(0.001\u03c0)=1000/\u03c0\u2248318.3098. So, ceil(1/(b\u03c0))=319. Therefore, the number of integers n is 3183 - 319 +1=2865. Wait, but earlier when I considered n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00009999<0.0001, so it's outside. Therefore, n should go up to 3182, which would give floor(1/(a\u03c0))=3183, but since x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than a, we need to subtract 1. So, the number of zeros is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0))=3183 -319=2864. Hmm, so which is correct? Let me think. The formula is number of zeros N= floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) +1? Wait, no, because the number of integers between m and n exclusive is floor(n) - ceil(m) +1. Wait, no, actually, the number of integers n satisfying m < n < M is floor(M-1) - ceil(m+1) +1? I might be getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula for the number of zeros as N= floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) +1. Let me test with a=0.0001 and b=0.001.\n\nCompute floor(1/(a\u03c0))=floor(3183.098)=3183.\n\nceil(1/(b\u03c0))=ceil(318.3098)=319.\n\nSo, N=3183 -319 +1=2865.\n\nBut earlier, when I considered n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00009999<0.0001, which is less than a=0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, which gives x\u22480.000100034>0.0001.\n\nSo, if I use N= floor(1/(a\u03c0)) -1 - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) +1= floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)).\n\nSo, N=3183 -1 -319 +1=3183 -319 -1 +1=3183 -319=2864.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)).\n\nIn this case, 3183 -319=2864.\n\nYes, that seems correct because when you take floor(1/(a\u03c0))=3183, which is the largest integer n where x=1/(n\u03c0) is just below a=0.0001, so we need to exclude that n=3183, hence subtract 1 more. So, the number of valid n is 3183 -1 -319 +1=3183 -319 -1 +1=3183 -319=2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe number of x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is found by determining the integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies within the interval. Calculating the range for n and adjusting for the endpoints, we find there are 2864 such integers.\n\n$\\boxed{2864}$"

Since n has to be an integer, n can take integer values from 319 up to 3183. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of integers is 3183 - 318 + 1 = 3183 - 318 is 2865, plus 1 is 2866. Wait, that seems too high. Let me check my calculations again. Wait, 3183 - 319 + 1 is the correct formula because the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Hmm, that's a lot of intercepts. Let me think again. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0, so between 0.0001 and 0.001, it's going to oscillate a lot. Each period of sin(1/x) corresponds to a change in x such that 1/x decreases by 2\u03c0. So, the number of zeros should be approximately the change in 1/x divided by \u03c0. Let's compute 1/x at the endpoints: 1/0.0001 = 10000 and 1/0.001 = 1000. So, the interval in terms of 1/x is from 1000 to 10000. The length of this interval is 10000 - 1000 = 9000. Each zero occurs every \u03c0 units, so the number of zeros would be approximately 9000 / \u03c0 \u2248 2866. That matches the earlier calculation. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2866. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake earlier when I subtracted 318 from 3183. Let me recast it. The lower bound for n is approximately 318.3098, so the smallest integer n is 319. The upper bound is approximately 3183.098, so the largest integer n is 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then +1 is 2865. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2866. Hmm, which one is correct? Let's check with smaller numbers. Suppose I have integers from 3 to 5 inclusive. 3,4,5. That's 3 numbers. 5 - 3 +1 = 3. Similarly, from 319 to 3183 inclusive, it's 3183 - 319 +1. So, 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, the correct number is 2865. But earlier, when I thought about the interval from 1000 to 10000 in terms of 1/x, which is 9000, divided by \u03c0, I got approximately 2866. There's a discrepancy here. Let me figure out why. The number of zeros should be the number of times n increases from 319 to 3183, which is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. But when I think of the interval length being 9000, divided by \u03c0, it's approximately 2866. So, which is correct? Let me think. The interval from 1000 to 10000 in 1/x corresponds to x from 0.001 to 0.0001. The number of zeros is the number of n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so n must be between 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n can be 319, 320, ..., 3183. The number of terms is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, the correct number is 2865. Therefore, the answer should be 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, leading to x = 1/(n\u03c0).

Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. The number of zeros of sin(1/x) in the interval (a, b) is equal to the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (a, b). So, the number of such n is equal to the number of integers between 1/(b\u03c0) and 1/(a\u03c0). So, let me compute 1/(0.001\u03c0) and 1/(0.0001\u03c0). 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.3098 and 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, the integers n must satisfy 318.3098 < n < 3183.098.

The interval is (0.0001, 0.001). So, x is approaching 0 from the right, and as x approaches 0, 1/x approaches infinity. So, sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly as x approaches 0. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a relatively small interval near zero, the function will oscillate a lot, leading to many zeros. So, 2865 seems like a plausible number. But let me check if I made a mistake in the bounds. Let me compute 1/(0.001\u03c0) exactly: 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184. So, the smallest integer n is 319. Similarly, 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, the largest integer n is 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.

Now, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, we can compute 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then adding 1 gives 2865.

Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more to get 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865. So, yes, that seems correct.

Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the values: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 = 2864; 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again. So, 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, but let me think about whether n starts at 319 or 318. Let me check the lower bound again. The lower bound was 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309, so n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. Similarly, the upper bound was 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so n must be less than that, so the largest integer n is 3183.

Wait, but 0.001 is the upper limit, so x must be less than 0.001. So, x=1/(n\u03c0) must be less than 0.001, which is true for n>318.309, so n=319 is the first integer. Similarly, for n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0001) \u2248 0.000099999, which is just above 0.0001, so it's within the interval. So, that seems correct.

Therefore, there should be 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the bounds. Let me recalculate 1/(0.0001\u03c0) and 1/(0.001\u03c0). 1/(0.0001\u03c0) is indeed 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, and 1/(0.001\u03c0) is 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309.

Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, let me test a couple of values. For n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.37) \u2248 0.0009976, which is just under 0.001, so it's included.

Wait, so x = 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001, which implies that n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but since the interval is open at 0.0001, we need x > 0.0001, so n must be less than 3183.098, meaning n can be 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, which is equal to the lower bound, so since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), x must be greater than 0.0001, so n must be less than 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but when n = 3183, x is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded. So, does that mean n can only go up to 3182? Wait, no, because 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but let me calculate it more precisely. Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0: \u03c0 \u2248 3.1415926535, so 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000.000000, because 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 exactly. But the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001, so n must satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n can be up to 3183, but when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000 - something), which would be slightly larger than 0.0001. Wait, let me compute 3182 * \u03c0: 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 Let's compute 3000*3.1416 = 9424.8, 182*3.1416 \u2248 571.5, so total \u2248 9424.8 + 571.5 \u2248 9996.3. So, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9996.3, so 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.3 \u2248 0.000100037, which is just over 0.0001, so x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100037, which is within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n can go up to 3182, because n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. Similarly, for the lower bound, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319, as before. So, now, the range of n is from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. Wait, that's different from before. So, earlier I thought n went up to 3183, but since n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, the maximum n is 3182. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. But wait, let me confirm this carefully.\n\nFirst, the interval is (0.0001, 0.001). So, x must satisfy 0.0001 < x < 0.001.\n\nGiven x = 1/(n\u03c0), we have:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nWhich implies:\n\n1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0)\n\nCalculating:\n\n1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309\n\n1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098\n\nSo, n must satisfy:\n\n318.309 < n < 3183.098\n\nSince n must be an integer, n can take values from 319 up to 3183. But wait, 3183 is less than 3183.098, so n can be 3183. But when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is exactly the lower bound of the interval, which is excluded. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) is excluded, so n can only go up to 3182. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nThus, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating:\n\n3182 - 319 = 2863\n\n2863 + 1 = 2864\n\nSo, there are 2864 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n goes up to 3183, but since x=1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded, so n must be up to 3182. Therefore, the correct number is 2864.\n\nBut let me double-check this with a smaller example to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Suppose I have an interval (a, b), and I want to find integers n such that c < n < d. The number of integers is floor(d-1) - ceil(c+1) +1? Wait, no, actually, the number of integers between c and d exclusive is floor(d) - ceil(c). Let me think.\n\nWait, in our case, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098.\n\nSo, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest integer n is 3183, but since x=1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded, n cannot be 3183. Therefore, the largest n is 3182.\n\nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nNumber of terms: 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I calculated 1/(3183\u03c0), I thought it was exactly 0.0001, but let me compute it more accurately.\n\nCompute 3183 * \u03c0:\n\n\u03c0 \u2248 3.141592653589793\n\n3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.141592653589793\n\nLet me compute 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796076938\n\n183 * \u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.141592653589793 \u2248 Let's compute 180*\u03c0 \u2248 565.4866776462439, and 3*\u03c0 \u2248 9.42477796076938, so total \u2248 565.4866776462439 + 9.42477796076938 \u2248 574.9114556070132\n\nSo, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796076938 + 574.9114556070132 \u2248 9999.689416376393\n\nThus, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.689416376393 \u2248 0.000100003125\n\nWait, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100003125, which is just slightly above 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100003125, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n can be 3183 because x=1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.000100003125, which is within the interval.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 3183\u03c0 was exactly 10000, but it's actually approximately 9999.6894, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.000100003125, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, n can be up to 3183.\n\nSo, that means the number of x-intercepts is from n=319 to n=3183 inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\n2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nSo, that's 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought 1/(3183\u03c0) was exactly 0.0001, I was mistaken. Actually, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.6894, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100003125, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, n can be 3183, so the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nBut wait, let's confirm with n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100003125, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Similarly, n=3184: x=1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3184*3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000.318) \u2248 0.000099996875, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, n can go up to 3183.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought 3183\u03c0 was 10000, I thought x=1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001, but actually, it's slightly more, so it's included. Therefore, the correct number is 2865.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial inequality.\n\nGiven x = 1/(n\u03c0), and x must be in (0.0001, 0.001), so:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nWhich implies:\n\n1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0)\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nCalculating:\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184\n\n10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, n must be an integer greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184.\n\nThus, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest integer n is 3183, because 3183 < 3183.09886184, so n=3183 is allowed.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 3183\u03c0 was 10000, but actually, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.6894, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100003125, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, n=3183 is valid, giving x\u22480.000100003125, which is within (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. To summarize:\n\n1. The x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n.\n\n2. We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\n3. Solving for n, we get 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\n4. Calculating, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\n5. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating, n ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

    "text": " 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) Calculating the right side: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.3098 So, putting it together, n must satisfy 318.3098 < n < 3183.098. Since n has to be an integer, n can take integer values starting from 319 up to 3183. Now, to find how many integers are there between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both ends are inclusive). Wait, actually, let me think: the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me calculate that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 integer values of n, which correspond to 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, when I calculated 1 / (0.0001\u03c0), I got approximately 3183.098, which seems correct because 0.0001 is 1e-4, so 1 / (1e-4 * \u03c0) is 1e4 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. Similarly, 1 / (0.001\u03c0) is 1e3 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.3098. So, n has to be greater than 318.3098, so the smallest integer n is 319, and less than 3183.098, so the largest integer n is 3183. Then, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, then 2864 + 1 is 2865. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any chance I missed an intercept or counted an extra one. Each x-intercept corresponds to a unique n, and since n increases by 1 each time, each intercept is at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, as n increases, x decreases. So, starting from n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.3) \u2248 0.0009967, which is just above 0.0001. Wait, no, 0.0009967 is actually 0.0009967, which is 0.0009967, which is greater than 0.0001, so that's within the interval. The next intercept is at n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, but wait, 3183\u03c0 is approximately 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 is excluded, so x must be greater than 0.0001. Therefore, the first intercept is at x \u2248 0.0009967, which is less than 0.001, so that's within the interval. The last intercept is at n = 3183, x \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but since it's excluded, we have to check if x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but it's slightly less because 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000. Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0: 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, and 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 574.5404, so total is approximately 9424.77796 + 574.5404 \u2248 10,000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001, which would be just below the interval's lower bound. Therefore, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's not included in the interval. Therefore, the largest n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001 is n = 3183 - 1 = 3182. Wait, no, let me think again. If n = 3183 gives x \u2248 0.0001, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, then n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n that gives x > 0.0001 is n = 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) would be slightly greater than 0.0001. Wait, let's check that. Let me compute 3182\u03c0: 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535. Again, 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, and 182\u03c0 \u2248 571.44, so total \u2248 9424.77796 + 571.44 \u2248 10,000. So, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 10,000 - \u03c0 \u2248 10,000 - 3.1415926535 \u2248 9996.8584. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.8584 \u2248 0.000100032, which is just above 0.0001. Therefore, n = 3182 gives x \u2248 0.000100032, which is within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, not 3183. So, earlier, I thought the maximum n was 3183, but that gives x just below 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, n can go up to 3182. Similarly, the minimum n is 319, as before. So, now, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, that's 2864 x-intercepts. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial calculation by including n=3183, which actually gives x just below 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the correct number is 2864. Let me verify this again. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001). So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) must be in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities because reciprocals reverse inequalities for positive numbers): 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating these: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. Therefore, n must be an integer greater than 318.3098 and less than 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, but wait, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but as we saw earlier, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but since x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.000100032, which is greater than 0.0001. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, 2864 x-intercepts. Therefore, the correct answer is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but now it's 2864. So, I need to make sure which one is correct. Let me think of a smaller example to check. Suppose I have an interval (a, b) and I want to find the number of integers n such that a < 1/(n\u03c0) < b. Let's say a = 0.1, b = 1. Then, 0.1 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 1, which implies 1 < n\u03c0 < 10, so 1/\u03c0 < n < 10/\u03c0. 1/\u03c0\u22480.318, 10/\u03c0\u22483.183. So, n can be 1, 2, 3. So, n=1: x=1/\u03c0\u22480.318, which is greater than 0.1 and less than 1. n=2: x=1/(2\u03c0)\u22480.159, which is also in the interval. n=3: x=1/(3\u03c0)\u22480.106, which is greater than 0.1. n=4: x=1/(4\u03c0)\u22480.079, which is less than 0.1, so excluded. So, n=1,2,3: 3 integers. So, the number of integers from 1 to 3 inclusive is 3. Now, according to the formula: floor(10/\u03c0)=3, ceil(1/\u03c0)=1. So, the number of integers is 3 - 1 + 1=3, which matches. So, in this case, the number of integers is floor(upper) - ceil(lower) + 1. Wait, in this case, upper=10/\u03c0\u22483.183, so floor(upper)=3. Lower=1/\u03c0\u22480.318, ceil(lower)=1. So, 3 -1 +1=3. So, that works. Similarly, in our problem, lower bound is 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) >0.0001, which implies n < 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.098. So, n <3183.098, so n_max=3183. But x=1/(3183\u03c0)=\u22480.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, n_max=3182. Similarly, n_min=ceil(1000/\u03c0)=ceil(318.3098)=319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 +1=2864. Therefore, the correct answer is 2864. So, earlier, I had mistakenly included n=3183, which gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)=\u22480.0001, which is excluded, so the correct number is 2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001  \n=> 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000  \n=> 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0  \n\u2248 318.31 < n < 3183.098\n\nn ranges from 319 to 3182, inclusive. The number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}."

Since n has to be an integer, n ranges from the smallest integer greater than 318.309 to the largest integer less than 3183.098. The smallest integer greater than 318.309 is 319, and the largest integer less than 3183.098 is 3183. Now, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, we can use the formula for the number of integers between a and b inclusive, which is b - a + 1. Plugging in the values: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 = 2864; 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, let me check that calculation again. 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the range of n. When x is 0.0001, n is approximately 3183.098, so the largest integer n is 3183. When x is 0.001, n is approximately 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. So, yes, n goes from 319 to 3183, which is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). For x in (0.0001, 0.001), n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 2865.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

    "text": " 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) Calculating that: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.3098 So, n must be greater than approximately 318.3098 and less than approximately 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, to find the number of integers in this range, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, is that right? Let me check. If n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n where x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recalculate the bounds for n. Starting with x = 1/(n\u03c0) in (0.0001, 0.001). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and remembering to reverse the inequalities when taking reciprocals because all terms are positive): 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. That simplifies to 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Then, dividing each part by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be greater than 318.3098 and less than 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Yep, that seems consistent. I think that's the correct number of x-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). To find the number of such x in (0.0001, 0.001), we solve for n:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001  \n=> 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000  \n=> 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.10\n\nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"
