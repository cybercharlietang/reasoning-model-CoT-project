    "text": " Let me compute 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. So yes, 2864, then +1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check. Sometimes when dealing with inequalities, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me verify the bounds again. So, x = 1/(n\u03c0) must satisfy 0.0001 < x < 0.001. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let's solve for n again. Starting with the lower bound: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than this, so the maximum integer n is 3183. For the upper bound: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than this, so the minimum integer n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think about the function sin(1/x) oscillating as x approaches 0. The closer x gets to 0, the more oscillations there are. But in this case, we're looking between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a very small interval near zero, so the function oscillates rapidly. Each oscillation corresponds to a zero crossing, which is an x-intercept. The number of oscillations can be approximated by the difference in 1/x at the endpoints. Let me see, at x = 0.001, 1/x = 1000. At x = 0.0001, 1/x = 10000. So, the argument of the sine function goes from 1000 to 10000 radians. The number of zeros would be approximately the number of times the sine function completes a full cycle between these two points. Since the sine function has a period of 2\u03c0, the number of zeros is roughly the number of half-periods between 1000 and 10000. But wait, each zero crossing is every \u03c0 radians. So, the number of zeros is the number of times \u03c0 fits into the interval from 1000 to 10000. So, the number of zeros would be (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 \u2248 9000 / 3.1416 \u2248 2866. But wait, that's approximately 2866, but earlier I got 2865. Hmm, that's a discrepancy of one. Let me think. When calculating the number of zeros between a and b, it's actually the floor of (b/\u03c0) minus the floor of (a/\u03c0). So, let's compute floor(10000/\u03c0) - floor(1000/\u03c0). 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so floor is 3183. 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so floor is 318. So, 3183 - 318 = 2865. That matches my earlier result. So, the number of zeros is 2865. Therefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Solving for x within (0.0001, 0.001) gives n ranging from 319 to 3183. The number of integers in this range is 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. Let me double-check the substitution. So, x = 1/(n\u03c0), and x must be in (0.0001, 0.001). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and remembering that flipping inequalities when taking reciprocals because all terms are positive), so 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Then, dividing each part by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating those: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098, so n from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that seems correct. But wait, I should consider whether n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0) which is approximately 1/(1003.12) \u2248 0.0009968, which is just under 0.001, so it's within the interval.

So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183, inclusive. Each of these n values corresponds to an x-intercept in the given interval. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me think again. Is this correct? Because when n increases, x decreases, right? So, as n goes from 319 to 3183, x goes from 1/(319\u03c0) down to 1/(3183\u03c0). But our interval is from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is from 1/10000 to 1/1000. So, let me check if 1/(319\u03c0) is indeed greater than 0.0001 and 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.001. Let's compute 1/(319\u03c0): 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 1004. So, 1/1004 \u2248 0.000996, which is approximately 0.001, but wait, 0.000996 is less than 0.001. Wait, that can't be right because 1/(319\u03c0) should be larger than 1/(3183\u03c0). Wait, no, 319 is less than 3183, so 1/319\u03c0 is larger than 1/3183\u03c0. So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1004) \u2248 0.000996, which is just under 0.001. Similarly, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) \u2248 0.0001. So, yes, 1/(319\u03c0) is approximately 0.000996, which is less than 0.001, and 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, which is just above 0.0001. So, that means n starts at 319, giving x \u2248 0.000996, which is within (0.0001, 0.001), and ends at n=3183, giving x\u22480.0001, which is just above 0.0001. So, that makes sense. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the range of n. Because when x is in (0.0001, 0.001), then 1/x is in (1000, 10000). So, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000.

Is the upper bound inclusive? The original inequality was 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which implies n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Because when n increases by 1, x decreases by a certain amount, but since we're dealing with an interval where x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a fixed range, the number of zeros should correspond to how many times 1/x passes through multiples of \u03c0 as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001. Wait, but 1/x goes from 1000 to 10000 as x goes from 0.001 to 0.0001. So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000, so the values of \u03b8 = 1/x go from 1000 to 10000. The zeros of sin(\u03b8) occur at \u03b8 = n\u03c0, so in this interval, \u03b8 ranges from 1000 to 10000. So, the number of zeros would be the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. So, let's find the smallest integer n such that n\u03c0 \u2265 1000, and the largest integer m such that m\u03c0 \u2264 10000. Then, the number of zeros would be m - n + 1. Let me compute n and m. First, n is the smallest integer where n\u03c0 \u2265 1000. So, n \u2265 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n = 319. Similarly, m is the largest integer where m\u03c0 \u2264 10000. So, m \u2264 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so m = 3183. So, the number of zeros is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That seems consistent with what I got earlier. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me think again. Since x is in (0.0001, 0.001), which is an open interval, does that affect anything? Because if x approaches 0.0001 from the right, 1/x approaches 10000 from the left, and as x approaches 0.001 from the right, 1/x approaches 1000 from the left. Wait, no, when x is 0.0001, 1/x is 10000, and when x is 0.001, 1/x is 1000. So, the interval for \u03b8 = 1/x is (1000, 10000). So, the zeros occur at \u03b8 = n\u03c0 where n is an integer, and \u03b8 must be in (1000, 10000). So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that seems correct.

Wait, but let me consider whether 1/(n\u03c0) is indeed within (0.0001, 0.001). For n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.12) \u2248 0.0009978, which is just under 0.001. And for n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0003) \u2248 0.00009999, which is just over 0.0001. So, both endpoints are included, so n=319 gives x \u2248 0.0009978, which is less than 0.001, and n=3183 gives x \u2248 0.00009999, which is greater than 0.0001. So, yes, all these n's correspond to x in the interval. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we determine where \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\).

Let me check again: x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, so 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. Since sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0, so 1/x = n\u03c0, which means n = 1/(x\u03c0). So, for x in (0.0001, 0.001), 1/x is in (1000, 10000). Therefore, n\u03c0 is in (1000, 10000), so n is in (1000/\u03c0, 10000/\u03c0).

But wait a second, I should make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the range of n. Let me double-check the inequalities. When x is 0.0001, 1/x is 10000. So, 1/x = 10000. So, the first n where 1/(n\u03c0) is just above 0.0001 would be when n is just below 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n = 3183 would give x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) = 0.0001, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, n must be less than 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183 because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) is just slightly less than 0.0001, but wait, that's not correct. Wait, let me think again. If n increases, 1/(n\u03c0) decreases. So, when n is 3183, 1/(n\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, 1/(n\u03c0) must be less than 0.001 and greater than 0.0001. Wait, that's not correct. Wait, no, x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, so 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, 1/x must be between 1000 and 10000. Therefore, 1/x = n\u03c0, so n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000. So, n must be between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.31 and 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.

So, 1/10000 = 0.0001. But wait, 3183 * \u03c0 is approximately 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, which is the lower bound of the interval. But our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is not included in the interval. Therefore, n should be less than 3183.098, but since n must be an integer, the maximum n is 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded. So, does that mean that n can only go up to 3182? Wait, no, because 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but actually, let me compute it more accurately.\n\nCompute 3183 * \u03c0: 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.0415926535 \u2248 approximately 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, and 3183 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 about 5.06. So, adding up: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.06 \u2248 450.68. So total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9549 + 450.68 \u2248 9999.68. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.68 \u2248 0.0001000032, which is just slightly above 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000032, which is greater than 0.0001, so it is included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n can be 3183, because x is just above 0.0001. Similarly, for the lower end, n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0). Let's compute 319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 1002. So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000998, which is just below 0.001. So, x=0.000998 is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval. So, n=319 gives x\u22480.000998, which is within (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Wait, but let me check again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, 2865 x-intercepts. But wait, let me think about the function sin(1/x). As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, and sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a small interval near zero, the function oscillates a lot. Each oscillation crosses zero twice, once going up and once going down. Wait, but in my earlier reasoning, I only counted the zeros where 1/x = n\u03c0, which are the points where sin(1/x) crosses zero going from positive to negative or vice versa. But actually, each period of sin(1/x) will cross zero twice. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think about the graph of sin(\u03b8) as \u03b8 increases. Each time \u03b8 increases by \u03c0, sin(\u03b8) crosses zero once, either going from positive to negative or negative to positive. So, in terms of \u03b8, each zero crossing occurs at \u03b8 = n\u03c0. So, for each n, there's a zero at \u03b8 = n\u03c0, which corresponds to x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, each zero crossing is at x = 1/(n\u03c0), and each such x is a single point where the function crosses zero. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept. So, the number of x-intercepts is equal to the number of integers n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which we found to be n from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 intercepts.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I remember that between any two consecutive zeros of sin(\u03b8), there's a peak and a trough, but each zero crossing is a single point. So, in terms of x, each x-intercept is a single point, so the count is just the number of such points, which is 2865.\n\nBut let me check the math again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the range of n.\n\nWe have 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nTaking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities because reciprocating positive numbers reverses the inequality):\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nWhich is approximately:\n\n318.309 < n < 3183.098\n\nSo, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nNumber of integers: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if 3183\u03c0 is exactly 10000. Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0:\n\n3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3000 * \u03c0 = 9424.77796, 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 575.363. So total \u2248 9424.77796 + 575.363 \u2248 999, 9424.77796 + 575.363 = 999, 9424.77796 + 575.363 = 999, 9424.77796 + 575.363 = 999, wait, that can't be right. Wait, 3000\u03c0 is about 9424.77796, and 183\u03c0 is about 575.363, so total is 9424.77796 + 575.363 \u2248 999, 9424.77796 + 575.363 = 999, but that's not correct because 9424.77796 + 575.363 is actually 999, but 9424 + 575 is 9999, right? So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.14096. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.14096 \u2248 0.0001000084, which is just slightly above 0.0001, so x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, 319\u03c0 \u2248 1002.001, so 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000998, which is less than 0.001, so included.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001  \n\u21d2 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000  \n\u21d2 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0  \n\u2248 318.309 < n < 3183.098  \n\nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 x-intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

Then, I substituted into the interval to find the bounds on n. I solved for n in both inequalities and found that n must be between approximately 318.309 and 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, I took the ceiling of 318.309 to get 319 and the floor of 3183.098 to get 3183. Then, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations or the logic. So, I think the answer is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0. This occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need to find the number of such x in (0.0001, 0.001).\n\n1. Set up the inequalities:\n   0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\n2.

So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. Let me double-check the bounds. The x-intercepts are at x = 1/(n\u03c0). The interval is (0.0001, 0.001). So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me solve for n again. Starting with 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n\u03c0 < 10000 => n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886 So, n must be less than approximately 3183.09886, so the maximum integer n is 3183. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n\u03c0 > 1000 => n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988 So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988, so the minimum integer n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me think again. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a very small interval near zero, the function will oscillate rapidly. Each oscillation corresponds to a period of 2\u03c0 in the argument of the sine function. So, the number of oscillations is roughly the change in 1/x divided by 2\u03c0. Let me see if that approach gives the same answer. The interval is from x1 = 0.0001 to x2 = 0.001. The corresponding 1/x values are 1/x1 = 10000 and 1/x2 = 1000. So, the change in 1/x is 10000 - 1000 = 9000. Each period is 2\u03c0, so the number of periods is 9000 / (2\u03c0) \u2248 9000 / 6.283 \u2248 1432. So, each period has two x-intercepts (one at the start and one at the end, but since it's periodic, each full period would cross twice). Wait, but actually, each period would cross twice, but near zero, the function is passing through zero at each multiple of \u03c0, so each zero crossing is at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, the number of zero crossings would be the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001). Which is exactly what I calculated earlier: n from 319 to 3183, which gives 2865. Alternatively, the number of zero crossings is approximately (1/x1 - 1/x2) / \u03c0. So, (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 = 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.198. Hmm, which is about 2866, but since we're dealing with integers, it's 2865. That makes sense because the exact count is 2865. So, I think my initial calculation is correct.

Starting with x = 1/(n\u03c0) in (0.0001, 0.001). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities because reciprocating positive numbers reverses the inequality): 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.

Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, that's correct. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts. Hmm, but wait a second. Let me think about whether each n corresponds to a unique x in the interval. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), and as n increases, x decreases. So, starting from n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) which is approximately 1/(1003.1) \u2248 0.0009968, which is just below 0.001. Wait, but 0.0009968 is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Similarly, for n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so does x=0.0001 count? No, because it's an open interval, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, x=1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. When n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so n=3183 would give x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is not included. So, actually, n must be less than 3183.098, but since n must be an integer, the maximum n is 3183, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n should be 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) would be slightly greater than 0.0001, which is included in the interval. Wait, let me check that. Let me compute 3182\u03c0: 3182 * 3.14159265 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 3182 * 3 = 9546, 3182 * 0.1416 \u2248 3182 * 0.1 = 318.2, 3182 * 0.04 = 127.28, 3182 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0912. So adding up: 9546 + 318.2 = 9864.2 + 127.28 = 9991.48 + 5.0912 \u2248 9996.5712. So, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9996.5712, so 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.5712 \u2248 0.000100034. So, that's just a bit over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n can go up to 3182, because 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, which is excluded. So, the maximum n is 3182. Similarly, the minimum n is 319, as before. So, now, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the count is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, that's 2864 x-intercepts. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but now I see that n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so n goes up to 3182, making the count 2864. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier by including n=3183. Let me confirm: when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is exactly the lower bound of the interval, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so n=3183 is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. So, the number of integers is from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. Let me compute that again: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 is 2864. So, the correct number is 2864. Wait, but let me check with another approach. The number of integers between a and b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, if a=319 and b=3182, then it's 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863, then +1 gives 2864. So, yes, 2864 is correct. Alternatively, I can think of it as the number of integers between 319 and 3182 inclusive is the same as the number of integers less than or equal to 3182 minus the number of integers less than 319. So, floor(3182) - floor(318.309) = 3182 - 318 = 2864. Wait, but that might not be the exact way, but it gives the same result. Alternatively, I can compute the number of n's as the floor of 10000/\u03c0 minus the ceiling of 1000/\u03c0. So, floor(10000/\u03c0) = floor(3183.098) = 3183, and ceiling(1000/\u03c0) = ceiling(318.309) = 319. So, the number of n's is 3183 - 319 + 1. Wait, but 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865, but since n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, we need to subtract 1, so 2865 -1=2864. Therefore, the correct number is 2864. So, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2864 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me think again. When n increases by 1, x decreases by 1/(n+1)\u03c0 - 1/n\u03c0 = (n - (n+1))/(n(n+1)\u03c0) = (-1)/(n(n+1)\u03c0). So, each subsequent x is smaller than the previous one. So, starting from n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009968, which is just below 0.001, and as n increases, x decreases towards 0.0001. So, the first x-intercept in the interval is at n=319, and the last one is at n=3182, which is just above 0.0001. So, the total number is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. Therefore, the answer is 2864.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of x-intercepts of \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we find where \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\).

The number of integers in this range is \\( 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864 \\).\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\(\\boxed{2864}\\)."

But wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. Let me check the substitution again. When x is in (0.0001, 0.001), then 1/x is in (1000, 10000). So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. So, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so n\u03c0 must be in (1000, 10000). Therefore, n must be in (1000/\u03c0, 10000/\u03c0), which is approximately (318.31, 3183.098). So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, as I found earlier.

Solving for n: 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0). Which is 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. As I calculated earlier, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098.

So, yeah, I think 2865 is the right number of x-intercepts. I don't think I missed anything here. Each n gives a unique x-intercept in that interval because as x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, and sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times.

So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the given interval. But wait, let me double-check. Sometimes when dealing with inequalities, especially when dealing with reciprocals, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me verify the initial inequalities again. We had 0.0001 < x < 0.001, and x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, substituting, we have 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and remembering that taking reciprocals reverses the inequality signs when dealing with positive numbers), we get 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing all parts by \u03c0, we get 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating these: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098, which means n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, as I thought earlier. So, the number of integers is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again to be sure. 3183 minus 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. Yep, that's correct. So, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me think about this a bit more. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches zero. So, between x = 0.0001 and x = 0.001, which is a range from 10^{-4} to 10^{-3}, the function sin(1/x) will oscillate between -1 and 1, crossing the x-axis each time 1/x increases by \u03c0. So, the number of zeros should be roughly the number of times 1/x can increase by \u03c0 within that interval. So, the change in 1/x from x = 0.001 to x = 0.0001 is from 1000 to 10000. So, the total change is 9000. Each zero crossing occurs every \u03c0 units, so the number of zeros should be approximately 9000 / \u03c0, which is about 2866. But wait, I got 2865 earlier. Hmm, that's close. The discrepancy is because when we take the floor and ceiling of the bounds, we might be off by one. Let me see: 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so the upper n is 3183, which is correct. Similarly, 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so the lower n is 319. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that matches. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) crosses the x-axis whenever 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0, i.e., at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer n. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), we find the range of n by solving 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which gives n between approximately 318.31 and 3183.09. Thus, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, yielding 2865 integer values.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the range for n. Let me double-check the inequalities. So, starting with 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let's solve for n step by step. Starting with the left inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Taking reciprocals (and remembering that flipping the inequality when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive): 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0 => 10000 > n\u03c0 => n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183. Now, the right inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001 => n\u03c0 > 1000 => n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098862. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in that interval. But wait, another way to think about this is that between 0.0001 and 0.001, the function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. Each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, we get another zero crossing. So, the number of zeros would be approximately the difference in 1/x at the endpoints divided by \u03c0. Let me compute that. Let me compute 1/x at x = 0.001 and x = 0.0001. 1/0.001 = 1000, and 1/0.0001 = 10000. So, the interval in terms of 1/x is from 1000 to 10000. The number of zeros would be roughly (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0, but since each zero occurs every \u03c0 units, so the number of zeros is approximately (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 \u2248 9000/3.1416 \u2248 2866. But wait, my earlier calculation gave 2865, which is close but off by one. Hmm, maybe because the endpoints aren't included, or perhaps because when we take the integer parts, it's slightly different. Let me see: the number of n's is from 319 to 3183, inclusive. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. But when I compute (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0, I get approximately 2866. So, there's a discrepancy of one. Maybe because when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.5) \u2248 0.000996, which is just above 0.0001 (since 1/1000 = 0.001, so 1/1003.5 \u2248 0.000996, which is less than 0.001, but greater than 0.0001). Wait, actually, 0.000996 is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Hmm, perhaps the approximation is slightly off because the endpoints are exclusive, so maybe the exact count is 2865. Alternatively, maybe the approximation gives 2866, but the exact count is 2865 because the last term is excluded. Wait, let me think. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 1/x must be less than 10000 and greater than 1000. So, 1000 < 1/x < 10000. So, 1/x ranges from just above 1000 to just below 10000. Therefore, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Which is approximately 318.309886 < n < 3183.098862. So, n can be from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that's correct. Therefore, the exact number is 2865. So, I think my initial calculation is correct, and the approximation was just slightly off because it's an approximation. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). For x in (0.0001, 0.001), 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. Thus, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, leading to n from 319 to 3183. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

    "text": " Let me compute 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the given interval. Wait, but let me think again. Is this correct? Because as x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a finite interval, the number of oscillations should also be finite. Each oscillation of sin(1/x) crosses the x-axis twice, except possibly at the endpoints. But wait, no, actually, each period of sin(\u03b8) crosses the x-axis twice: once when going from 0 to positive, and once when going back to 0 from positive to negative, or vice versa. But wait, in reality, the zeros of sin(\u03b8) are spaced every \u03c0 apart, not every 2\u03c0. So, each zero is every \u03c0, meaning that between each zero, there's a peak or a trough. So, in terms of x-intercepts, each zero crossing is a single point where the function crosses from positive to negative or vice versa. So, in the function sin(1/x), each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the function completes half a period, so the zeros are spaced every \u03c0 in \u03b8, which corresponds to every 1/(n\u03c0) in x. So, each zero is at x = 1/(n\u03c0), so each zero is separated by a distance in x of 1/(n\u03c0) - 1/((n+1)\u03c0) = (n+1 - n)/(\u03c0n(n+1)) )= 1/(\u03c0n(n+1)). But maybe that's not necessary here. The key point is that each integer n gives a zero at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, the number of zeros in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is equal to the number of integers n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. As we calculated earlier, that gives n from 319 to 3183, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me verify with specific examples. Let's take n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.7) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001 and greater than 0.0001. Similarly, n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, but since 0.0001 is the lower bound and it's exclusive, we need to check if 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Let's compute 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.0, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, we need to check if x=1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Let's compute 1/(3183\u03c0): 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000.0, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000 (because \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 3183 * 3.1415926535 = let's compute 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.1416 \u2248 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.0416 \u2248 132.3, so total \u2248 318.3 + 132.3 \u2248 450.6, so total 9549 + 450.6 \u2248 9999.6. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.6, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.6 \u2248 0.000100004, which is just over 0.0001. So, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100004, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. Similarly, n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.7) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so included. Now, what about n=318: x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.0) \u2248 0.001, but since the interval is up to 0.001 exclusive, we need to check if 1/(318\u03c0) is less than 0.001. Let's compute 318\u03c0 \u2248 318 * 3.1416 \u2248 1000.0. So, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.001, but since 318\u03c0 is exactly 1000.0, then 1/(318\u03c0) = 0.001, which is the upper bound, but the interval is open, so 0.001 is excluded. Therefore, n=318 gives x=0.001, which is not included, so the smallest n is 319. Similarly, n=3183 gives x\u22480.000100004, which is just above 0.0001, so included. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, so the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 -19=2864, then add 1: 2865. So, 2865 x-intercepts. But wait, is that correct? Because between 0.0001 and 0.001, the function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. So, the number of zeros increases as x decreases. But in our case, since the interval is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a finite interval, we're counting all the zeros in that range. Each zero corresponds to a unique n, so 2865 zeros. Hmm, that seems like a lot, but considering how rapidly sin(1/x) oscillates near zero, it's plausible. Let me think of a different approach to verify. The function y = sin(1/x) has zeros at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer n. So, the number of zeros in (a, b) is equal to the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (a, b). So, 1/(n\u03c0) > a => n < 1/(a\u03c0) and 1/(n\u03c0) < b => n > 1/(b\u03c0). So, n must satisfy 1/(b\u03c0) < n < 1/(a\u03c0). Since n must be an integer, the number of integers is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) + 1? Wait, let me think. Wait, no, because n must be greater than 1/(b\u03c0) and less than 1/(a\u03c0). So, the number of integers n is floor(1/(a\u03c0) - 1) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0) + 1) + 1? Hmm, maybe it's better to use the formula: number of integers between m and n inclusive is n - m +1. So, in our case, m = ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) and n = floor(1/(a\u03c0)). So, number of zeros is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) + 1. Let's compute that. Here, a = 0.0001, b = 0.001. So, 1/(a\u03c0) = 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, floor(1/(a\u03c0)) = 3183. 1/(b\u03c0) = 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618. So, ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) = 319. Therefore, number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, same result as before. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe number of x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is determined by finding all integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies within the interval. By calculating the range of n and counting the integers, we find there are 2865 such intercepts.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."
