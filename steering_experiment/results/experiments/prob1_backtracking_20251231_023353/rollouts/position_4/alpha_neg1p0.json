    "text": " \n\nSo, in this case, \u03b8 is 1/x. That means sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0. Solving for x, that would be x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, each x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n. Now, I need to find all such x that lie within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nLet me write that down: 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), I can substitute that into the inequalities to find the range of n. So, substituting, I get 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. \n\nHmm, I can solve this inequality for n. Let me rearrange each part. Starting with the left part: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that taking reciprocals reverses the inequality, I get 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. 1 divided by 0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, I get n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1416, so 10000 divided by 3.1416 is roughly 3183.098. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.098.\n\nNow, the right part of the inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals on both sides, I get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 divided by 3.1416 is approximately 318.309. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309.\n\nSince n has to be an integer, the smallest integer greater than 318.309 is 319, and the largest integer less than 3183.098 is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. \n\nNow, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1. Wait, actually, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, plugging in, it would be 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. \n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. So, starting with 0.0001 < x < 0.001, and x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals, 10000 > n\u03c0 > 1000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which gives 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. \n\nCalculating 1000/\u03c0, as I did before, is approximately 318.309, and 10000/\u03c0 is approximately 3183.098. So, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. \n\nWait, that seems correct. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nBut wait, let me think again. Is there any chance I missed something? For example, when dealing with inequalities, sometimes endpoints can be tricky, but since the interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), we don't include the endpoints. So, x can't be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001, but since n is an integer, the corresponding x values are 1/(n\u03c0), which will never exactly be 0.0001 or 0.001 unless n is such that 1/(n\u03c0) equals those, which it doesn't because 0.0001 is 1/10000 and 0.001 is 1/1000. So, since 1000 and 10000 aren't multiples of \u03c0, those exact points aren't included, which is consistent with the open interval. \n\nAlso, I should consider whether the function sin(1/x) is oscillating more or less in that interval. As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is very close to zero, the function will oscillate very rapidly. Each time n increases by 1, the corresponding x decreases by a small amount, leading to a dense set of x-intercepts. \n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is equal to the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is within (0.0001, 0.001), which we found to be 2865. \n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the final answer should be 2865.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\):\n\n1. **Identify where the sine function is zero**: \\( \\sin(\\theta) = 0 \\) when \\( \\theta = n\\pi \\) for integer \\( n \\).\n2. **Set \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\)**: Solving for \\( x \\) gives \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n3. **Determine the range for \\( x \\)**: \\( 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\).\n4. **Solve for \\( n \\)**:\n   - \\( \\frac{1}{0.001} < n\\pi < \\frac{1}{0.0001} \\) leads to \\( 1000 < n\\pi < 10000 \\).\n   - Dividing by \\( \\pi \\) gives \\( \\frac{1000}{\\pi} \\approx 318.309 < n < \\frac{10000}{\\pi} \\approx 3183.098 \\).\n5. **Find integer \\( n \\)**: \\( n \\) ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n6. **Count integers**: The number of integers from 319 to 3183 is \\( 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 \\).\n\n**Answer**: The number of x-intercepts is \\(\\boxed{2865}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nSo, if I set sin(1/x) = 0, that means 1/x must be equal to n\u03c0. Therefore, 1/x = n\u03c0, which implies that x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, every x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n. Now, I need to find all such x that lie within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nFirst, let's write down the interval in terms of x: 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, and x = 1/(n\u03c0), I can substitute that into the inequality to find the range of n. \n\nSo, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me solve these inequalities for n. \n\nStarting with the left inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that taking reciprocals reverses the inequality, I get 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Calculating 1/0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, which is approximately 3.1416, I get n < 10000/\u03c0. \n\nSimilarly, the right inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals again, I get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. \n\nNow, let's compute these values numerically. \n\nFirst, 10000 divided by \u03c0: 10000/3.1416 \u2248 3183.09886. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.09886. Since n has to be an integer, the maximum possible n is 3183. \n\nNext, 1000 divided by \u03c0: 1000/3.1416 \u2248 318.309886. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886. Since n has to be an integer, the minimum possible n is 319. \n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. \n\nTo find the number of integers from a to b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the values: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that. \n\n3183 minus 319 is... Let me subtract 300 first: 3183 - 300 = 2883. Then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2864 + 1 = 2865. \n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. \n\nWait, 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, as before. Then 2883 - 19 = 2864. So, 2864 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, that's correct. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure that x = 1/(n\u03c0) is indeed within (0.0001, 0.001) for these n. \n\nFor n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1004.5) \u2248 0.0009955, which is approximately 0.0009955, which is just under 0.001, so that's within the interval. \n\nFor n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0003) \u2248 0.000099999, which is just over 0.0001, so that's also within the interval. \n\nSo, both endpoints are included, and all n in between will produce x values within the interval. \n\nWait, but let me check if n = 3183 gives x just above 0.0001. Let me compute 1/(3183 * \u03c0). \n\nCalculating 3183 * \u03c0: 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 Let's compute 3000*3.1416 = 9424.8, and 183*3.1416 \u2248 575.0688. So, total is approximately 9424.8 + 575.0688 \u2248 10,000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. \n\nSimilarly, n = 319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 1004.5, so 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009955, which is just under 0.001. \n\nSo, yes, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, giving x values just above 0.0001 to just below 0.001. \n\nBut wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check the inequalities again. \n\nWe have x = 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886. So, n must be less than 3183.09886, so the maximum integer n is 3183. \n\nSimilarly, x = 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886. So, the minimum integer n is 319. \n\nSo, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that's 2865 x-intercepts. \n\nWait, but let me think about whether each n in that range gives a unique x in the interval. Since each n corresponds to a unique x = 1/(n\u03c0), and as n increases, x decreases, moving from 0.0009955 down to 0.000099999, which is within (0.0001, 0.001). So, each n in 319 to 3183 gives a unique x-intercept in that interval. \n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. \n\nWait, but let me check if n=3183 is included. 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099999, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. Similarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.0009955, which is just below 0.001, so it's included. \n\nSo, the total number is 2865. \n\nBut wait, let me think again about the calculation. 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 gives 2865. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a +1. So, 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. \n\nYes, that seems correct. \n\nSo, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nWait, but let me think again. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. So, between 0.0001 and 0.001, it's oscillating rapidly, and each oscillation crosses zero twice: once going up and once going down. Wait, but wait, sin(\u03b8) is zero at \u03b8 = n\u03c0, but between each two consecutive zeros, there's a peak and a trough. So, between \u03b8 = n\u03c0 and \u03b8 = (n+1)\u03c0, sin(\u03b8) goes from 0 up to 1 and back down to 0, or from 0 down to -1 and back up to 0. So, each interval between n\u03c0 and (n+1)\u03c0, sin(\u03b8) crosses zero once, but actually, it's just the zeros themselves. Wait, no, each zero is a single point. So, each zero occurs at \u03b8 = n\u03c0, so each x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept. \n\nWait, but wait, in the function sin(1/x), as x approaches 0, the function oscillates infinitely many times. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a finite interval, but very close to zero, the function oscillates very rapidly. So, the number of zeros should be proportional to the reciprocal of the interval length, scaled by \u03c0. \n\nWait, but according to our earlier calculation, it's 2865 zeros. That seems plausible because the interval is from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is a factor of 10 in x, but since x is in the denominator inside the sine function, the number of oscillations increases as x decreases. \n\nWait, but let me think of it another way. The number of zeros is equal to the number of times 1/x crosses an integer multiple of \u03c0 as x moves from 0.001 down to 0.0001. So, when x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001, 1/x increases from 1000 to 10000. So, the number of zeros is the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. \n\nSo, the smallest n where n\u03c0 \u2265 1000 is n = ceil(1000/\u03c0) = 319, as before. The largest n where n\u03c0 \u2264 10000 is n = floor(10000/\u03c0) = 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. \n\nTherefore, the number of zeros is 2865. \n\nWait, but let me just confirm with a smaller example. Suppose I take an interval from x = a to x = b, where a < b. The number of zeros of sin(1/x) in (a, b) would be the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (a, b). So, solving for n, we get n in (1/(b\u03c0), 1/(a\u03c0)). The number of integers in that interval is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) + 1. \n\nIn our case, a = 0.0001, b = 0.001. So, 1/(a\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886, and 1/(b\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886. So, the number of integers is floor(3183.09886) - ceil(318.309886) + 1 = 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. \n\nYes, that seems correct. \n\nSo, the final answer is 2865 x-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of x-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we start by noting that the sine function is zero at integer multiples of \\( \\pi \\).

The number of integers in this range is \\( 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 \\).\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

    "text": " \n\nSo, applying that to the function y = sin(1/x), we set 1/x equal to n\u03c0. That gives us x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer values of n. Now, I need to find all such x within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nLet me write down the inequalities for x:\n\n0.0001 < x < 0.001\n\nSubstituting x = 1/(n\u03c0) into this, we get:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nI can rewrite these inequalities to solve for n. Let me take the reciprocal of all parts, remembering that taking reciprocals reverses the inequalities:\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nCalculating those reciprocals:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nNow, to solve for n, I'll divide all parts by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nCalculating these values:\n\n1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184\n\nSimilarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183.\n\nNow, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, no, actually, if n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\n2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nSo, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, let me double-check that calculation because sometimes when subtracting, it's easy to make a mistake. So, 3183 minus 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, plugging in a = 319 and b = 3183, we get 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Yep, that checks out.\n\nLet me also consider whether the endpoints are included. Since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, we need to ensure that x = 1/(n\u03c0) is strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. So, when n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.09) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001 and greater than 0.0001. Similarly, when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.00) = 0.0001, but since the interval is open at 0.0001, we need to check if x is greater than 0.0001. Wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but let me compute it more accurately.\n\nWait, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 10000.000000000000... So, 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.0001, we don't include x = 0.0001. So, does that mean that n = 3183 gives x = 0.0001, which is excluded? So, perhaps n should go up to 3182 instead of 3183.\n\nWait, let me check: 3183\u03c0 is exactly 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001. Since our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.0001, we need to exclude x = 0.0001. Therefore, n = 3183 would give x = 0.0001, which is not included. So, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nSimilarly, n = 319 gives x \u2248 0.000997, which is within (0.0001, 0.001). So, the lower bound is okay.\n\nSo, now, if n starts at 319 and ends at 3182, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that:\n\n3182 - 319 = 2863\n\n2863 + 1 = 2864\n\nSo, that would give 2864 x-intercepts. But wait, earlier I thought n went up to 3183, but since x = 1/(3183\u03c0) = 0.0001 is excluded, then n should go up to 3182.\n\nBut let me confirm this because sometimes when dealing with inequalities, it's easy to miscalculate.\n\nSo, starting from the inequality:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nAs before, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184\n\n10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184.\n\nSince n must be an integer, the smallest n is 319, and the largest n is 3183, because 3183 < 3183.09886184. Wait, 3183 is less than 3183.09886184, so n can be 3183, because 3183\u03c0 is 10000, which gives x = 0.0001, which is not included. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but since x = 1/(3183\u03c0) = 0.0001 is excluded, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so n can be up to 3183, but x = 0.0001 is excluded, so perhaps n can only go up to 3182.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me think again.\n\nIf n = 3183, then x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, which is the lower bound of the interval, but the interval is open at 0.0001, so x must be greater than 0.0001. Therefore, x = 0.0001 is excluded, so n = 3183 is excluded.\n\nTherefore, the maximum n is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) is slightly greater than 0.0001. Let me check that.\n\nCompute 3182 * \u03c0: 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 10000 - \u03c0, because 3183\u03c0 = 10000, so 3182\u03c0 = 10000 - \u03c0 \u2248 10000 - 3.1415926535 \u2248 9996.85840735.\n\nSo, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.85840735 \u2248 0.0001000314, which is just slightly above 0.0001, so it is included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n = 3182 is included, but n = 3183 is excluded because x = 0.0001 is not included.\n\nTherefore, the values of n start at 319 and go up to 3182, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n3182 - 319 = 2863\n\n2863 + 1 = 2864\n\nSo, there are 2864 integer values of n, meaning 2864 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n went up to 3183, giving 2865 intercepts, but now I'm getting 2864 because n=3183 is excluded. Which is correct?\n\nLet me think about it step by step.\n\nThe inequality is 0.0001 < x < 0.001, and x = 1/(n\u03c0).\n\nSo, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nTaking reciprocals:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDivide by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, n must be an integer greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest integer n is 3183, but since 3183\u03c0 = 10000, which gives x = 0.0001, which is excluded, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) = 0.0001 is excluded, so n cannot be 3183. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nNumber of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1.\n\nSo, 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nTherefore, there are 2864 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so n=3183 is excluded, so the maximum n is 3182.\n\nTherefore, the number of intercepts is 2864.\n\nBut let me check with specific examples.\n\nFor example, when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000997, which is between 0.0001 and 0.001.\n\nWhen n=3182, x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000314, which is just above 0.0001, so included.\n\nn=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001, excluded.\n\nSo, the number of n's is from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nSo, 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as the number of integers between 319 and 3182 inclusive.\n\nAnother way: The total number of integers from 1 to 3182 is 3182, and from 1 to 318 are 318, so the number from 319 to 3182 is 3182 - 318 = 2864.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, which is it?\n\nI think the confusion comes from whether n=3183 is included or not. Since x=0.0001 is excluded, n=3183 is excluded, so the maximum n is 3182, making the count 2864.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the final answer is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). For x in (0.0001, 0.001), we find n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, leading to n between approximately 319 and 3182. Thus, there are 2864 x-intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2864}$"

    "text": " \n\nGiven that y = sin(1/x), setting this equal to zero gives sin(1/x) = 0. So, 1/x must be equal to n\u03c0. Therefore, x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer values of n. Now, I need to find all such x that lie within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nFirst, let me write down the interval in terms of x: 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, and x = 1/(n\u03c0), I can substitute that in to find the range of n. \n\nSo, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me solve for n. \n\nStarting with the left inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that flipping inequalities when taking reciprocals reverses them, so:\n\n1/0.0001 > n\u03c0\n\nWhich is 10000 > n\u03c0. Therefore, n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n is an integer, the maximum n can be is 3183.\n\nNow, the right inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, we get:\n\nn\u03c0 > 1/0.001 => n\u03c0 > 1000. Therefore, n > 1000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618. Since n is an integer, the smallest n can be is 319.\n\nSo, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. Now, I need to count how many integers are in this range. \n\nTo find the number of integers from a to b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, substituting, we get 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, there are 2865 integers in this range, which would correspond to 2865 x-intercepts in the given interval.\n\nWait, let me just verify that. Let me check the calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nStarting with the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, x is between 0.0001 and 0.001. Then, x = 1/(n\u03c0), so n must satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nSo, solving for n:\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, as I did before, n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n \u2264 3183.\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n \u2265 319.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating 3183 - 319: Let's see, 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, yes, 2865. \n\nWait a second, but I'm a bit concerned because when dealing with such small x values, the function sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely as x approaches 0. But in this case, the interval is from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is a finite interval, so the number of zeros should be finite. So, 2865 seems plausible, but let me just check if I considered all the steps correctly.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider how many times the sine function completes a full cycle between x = 0.0001 and x = 0.001. The function sin(1/x) has a period of 2\u03c0/(1) = 2\u03c0, but since 1/x is the argument, as x decreases, the function oscillates more rapidly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the number of zeros by considering how many times the argument 1/x passes through multiples of \u03c0 as x moves from 0.001 to 0.0001.\n\nSo, let me consider the interval for 1/x. When x is 0.001, 1/x is 1000. When x is 0.0001, 1/x is 10000. So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000 as x goes from 0.001 to 0.0001. So, the argument of the sine function goes from 1000 to 10000 radians.\n\nEach time 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0, sin(1/x) crosses zero. So, the number of zeros is equal to the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000, inclusive.\n\nWait, but actually, when 1/x crosses n\u03c0, where n is an integer, that's where the zeros occur. So, the number of zeros is equal to the number of integers n such that n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000.\n\nSo, let me compute n such that 1000 \u2264 n\u03c0 \u2264 10000.\n\nDividing by \u03c0, we get 1000/\u03c0 \u2264 n \u2264 10000/\u03c0.\n\nAs before, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, so n starts at 319.\n\n10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618, so n ends at 3183.\n\nSo, the number of integers n from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nTherefore, the number of zeros is 2865.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: the number of times sin(1/x) crosses zero in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is equal to the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001). Which is exactly what I did earlier, leading to 2865.\n\nSo, I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let me check the endpoints.\n\nWhen x = 0.001, 1/x = 1000. So, sin(1000) is sin(1000 radians). Now, 1000 radians is a large angle, but it's equivalent to 1000 mod 2\u03c0. Let me compute how many full circles that is. 2\u03c0 is about 6.28319. So, 1000 divided by 6.28319 is approximately 159.1549431. So, 159 full circles, and a remainder of about 0.1549431 * 6.28319 \u2248 0.973 radians. So, sin(1000) \u2248 sin(0.973) \u2248 0.823, which is not zero. So, at x = 0.001, the function is not zero, which makes sense because x = 0.001 is not an x-intercept, as the interval is open.\n\nSimilarly, at x = 0.0001, 1/x = 10000. Let's compute sin(10000 radians). Again, 10000 divided by 2\u03c0 is approximately 1591.549431. So, the remainder is 0.549431 * 2\u03c0 \u2248 3.445 radians. So, sin(3.445) \u2248 sin(\u03c0 + 0.303) \u2248 -sin(0.303) \u2248 -0.297, which is also not zero. So, the endpoints are not zeros, which is consistent with the interval being open.\n\nTherefore, the number of zeros is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me just think again about the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive. So, from 319 to 3183, how many numbers is that? Let me compute 3183 - 319 = 2864, then add 1 to include both endpoints, so 2865. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the number of integers between a and b inclusive, it's b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me take a smaller example. Suppose I have n from 2 to 5 inclusive. Then, the numbers are 2,3,4,5. That's 4 numbers. 5 - 2 +1 = 4. So, yes, that formula works.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3183 - 319 again. 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then minus 19 is 2864. So, 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) for the function y = sin(1/x).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

    "text": " \n\nGiven that y = sin(1/x), setting this equal to zero gives sin(1/x) = 0. So, 1/x must be an integer multiple of \u03c0. Therefore, 1/x = n\u03c0, which implies that x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer values of n. \n\nNow, I need to find all such x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). That is, 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), I can rewrite the inequalities in terms of n. \n\nStarting with the left inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides (and reverse the inequality because reciprocals reverse the inequality when both sides are positive), I get 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Calculating 1/0.0001, that's 10000. So, 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, which is approximately 3.1415926535, gives n < 10000 / \u03c0. Let me compute that: 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n must be less than or equal to 3183.\n\nNow, the right inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n\u03c0 > 1000. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, n > 1000 / \u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 318.309886184. So, n must be greater than 318.309886184. Since n is an integer, n must be at least 319.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is given by b - a + 1. So, plugging in the values: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers in this range.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. The number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Hmm, 3183 minus 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more gives 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure that both endpoints are included correctly. When n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0). Let me check if that's greater than 0.0001. 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(319*3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(1003.14) \u2248 0.0009968, which is indeed greater than 0.0001. Similarly, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183*3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000.000000000002) \u2248 0.0001, which is just slightly above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. So, both endpoints are valid.\n\nWait, but hold on. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, meaning it doesn't include the endpoints. So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is just equal to 0.0001. But since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so n=3183 gives x=0.0001..., which is just equal to 0.0001, so it's not included. Similarly, for n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001, so it's included because the upper bound is open. Wait, no, 0.0009968 is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval. But wait, n=319 gives x\u22480.0009968, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. But n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001, which is equal to the lower bound, so it's not included. So, does n start at 319 and go up to 3182? Because 3183 would give x=0.0001, which is excluded.\n\nWait, let me compute x when n=3183: 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001. So, exactly 0.0001, which is the lower bound. Since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), open at both ends, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so n must be less than 3183. So, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nSimilarly, let me check n=319: 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001, so it's included because the upper bound is open. So, n=319 is included.\n\nSo, now, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n went up to 3183, but now I'm considering n up to 3182 because n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. So, that reduces the count by 1, making it 2864 instead of 2865.\n\nWait, let me check with n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182*3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000 - something). Let me compute 3182*\u03c0: 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's compute 3000*3.1416=9424.8, 182*3.1416\u2248572.33, so total \u2248 9424.8 + 572.33 \u2248 9997.13. So, 1/(9997.13) \u2248 0.000100028, which is just slightly above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. So, n=3182 gives x\u22480.000100028, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. So, n=3182 is included, but n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded.\n\nSimilarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.0009968, which is less than 0.001, so included. So, the number of n's is from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the count is 3182 - 319 +1.\n\nWait, let me compute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863. Then add 1: 2864. So, 2864 integers.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Let me take a smaller example to see if the formula works. Suppose I have n from a to b inclusive, how many numbers is that? It's b - a +1. So, if a=1 and b=3, that's 3 numbers: 1,2,3. 3-1+1=3, correct. So, in this case, a=319, b=3182. So, 3182 - 319 +1= 2864.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so n goes up to 3182. So, the count is 3182 - 319 +1=2864.\n\nBut wait, let me check n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0). Let me compute 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 3180 * \u03c0 \u2248 3180*3.1415926535 \u2248 3180*3=9540, 3180*0.1415926535\u22483180*0.1416\u2248450. So, total \u22489540+450=9990. So, 3182\u03c0\u22489990 + 2\u03c0\u22489990 +6.283\u22489996.283. So, 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22481/9996.283\u22480.000100037, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nSimilarly, n=319: 319\u03c0\u2248319*3.1415926535\u2248319*3=957, 319*0.1415926535\u2248319*0.1416\u224845.14, so total\u2248957+45.14\u22481002.14. So, 1/(319\u03c0)\u22481/1002.14\u22480.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so included.\n\nSo, n=319 gives x\u22480.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so included. n=3182 gives x\u22480.000100037, which is greater than 0.0001, so included.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 3182 - 319 +1=2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but after considering the open interval, it's 2864.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial calculation. The initial approach was to solve 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nSo, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) implies n\u03c0 < 10000, so n < 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.09886184. So, n can be up to 3183, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so n=3183 would give x=1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001..., which is exactly 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, n must be less than or equal to 3182.\n\nSimilarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n > 1000/\u03c0\u2248318.309886184, so n must be at least 319.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 +1=2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with a calculator: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the number of integers between a and b inclusive is floor(b) - ceil(a) +1.\n\nIn this case, a=318.309886184, so ceil(a)=319.\n\nb=3183.09886184, so floor(b)=3183.\n\nBut since x must be greater than 0.0001, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so floor(b)=3183, but n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so the maximum n is 3182.\n\nWait, but if I use the formula floor(b) - ceil(a) +1, with a=318.309886184 and b=3183.09886184, it would be 3183 - 319 +1=2865. But since n=3183 is excluded, we have to subtract 1, giving 2864.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of inequalities.\n\nWe have x=1/(n\u03c0) must satisfy 0.0001 < x < 0.001.\n\nSo, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nTaking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities):\n\n10000 > n\u03c0 > 1000.\n\nDividing by \u03c0:\n\n10000/\u03c0 > n > 1000/\u03c0.\n\nWhich is approximately:\n\n3183.09886184 > n > 318.309886184.\n\nSince n must be an integer, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. But wait, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001..., which is exactly 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so the maximum n is 3182.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 +1=2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001..., which is exactly 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, n=3183 is not included. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me compute 3182 - 319 +1.\n\n3182 - 319: 3182 - 300=2882, then subtract 19: 2882 -19=2863, then add 1: 2864.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the number of zeros by considering the behavior of the function.\n\nThe function y=sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. The number of oscillations increases as x approaches 0. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), we're looking at x values between 0.0001 and 0.001, which correspond to 1/x values between 1000 and 10000.\n\nSo, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. The sine function has a zero every \u03c0 units. So, the number of zeros in this interval would be approximately (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 = 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.198. But since we're dealing with integer n's, it's about 2866 zeros. But wait, this is an approximation, and my earlier exact calculation gave 2864, which is close.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I need to be more precise. The number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nSo, n must be integers from ceil(1000/\u03c0) to floor(10000/\u03c0).\n\nCompute 1000/\u03c0\u2248318.309886184, so ceil(1000/\u03c0)=319.\n\n10000/\u03c0\u22483183.09886184, so floor(10000/\u03c0)=3183.\n\nBut since x must be greater than 0.0001, which is 1/(3183\u03c0), so n must be less than 3183.09886184, so the maximum n is 3183, but n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. So, n must be up to 3182.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers is from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 +1=2864.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the approximate number was 2866, but the exact count is 2864. The difference is because the endpoints are excluded, so we lose two intercepts: one at n=3183 and maybe another? Wait, no, only n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. The lower end is n=319, which gives x\u22480.0009978, which is included. So, only one intercept is lost, so the count is 2865 -1=2864.\n\nWait, but if I consider that n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, that's 3183 - 319 +1=2865. But since n=3183 is excluded, it's 2865 -1=2864.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the final answer is 2864 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nBut wait, let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let me compute 3182 - 319 +1.\n\n3182 - 319: Let's compute 3182 - 300=2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 -19=2863, then add 1: 2864. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I compute the number of integers from a to b inclusive as b - a +1, then 3182 - 319 +1=2864.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, I think the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer n. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), x must satisfy 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. This leads to n ranging from 319 to 3182, giving 2864 intercepts.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}."

    "text": " \n\nGiven that, in this problem, \u03b8 is 1/x. So, I can set up the equation: sin(1/x) = 0, which implies that 1/x = n\u03c0. Then, solving for x, I get x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for each integer n.\n\nNow, I need to find all such x within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, I should find all integers n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me write that down:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nI can solve this inequality for n. Let me start by taking reciprocals on all parts, remembering that taking reciprocals reverses the inequalities. But I have to be careful because all terms are positive, so the inequalities will reverse when I take reciprocals. Let me do that step by step.\n\nFirst, let's solve the left part of the inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Taking reciprocals, this becomes 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Calculating 1/0.0001 gives 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, I get n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618.\n\nSimilarly, solving the right part of the inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals again, this becomes n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n\u03c0 > 1000, and dividing both sides by \u03c0, I get n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184.\n\nSo, putting it all together, n must satisfy 318.309886184 < n < 3183.0988618. Since n has to be an integer, n can take integer values from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range.\n\nTo find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, no, actually, if n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183, the number of integers is 3183 - 318 = 2865, but wait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. If I have numbers from a to b inclusive, the count is b - a + 1. So, in this case, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the count would be 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that.\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864, then adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, solving 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nTaking reciprocals, as I did, gives 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Then, dividing by \u03c0, we get 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.309886184 < n < 3183.0988618.\n\nSo, n must be an integer greater than 318.309..., so the smallest integer n is 319, and less than 3183.098..., so the largest integer n is 3183. So, the integers n are from 319 to 3183, inclusive.\n\nNow, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is indeed b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when n increases by 1, x decreases by 1/(\u03c0(n+1)) - 1/(\u03c0n). Hmm, but that's not directly relevant here. I think the count is correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: the number of zeros of sin(1/x) in (a, b) is equal to the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (a, b). So, in this case, a is 0.0001 and b is 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) must be between 0.0001 and 0.001.\n\nWhich, as I found earlier, translates to n between approximately 318.309886184 and 3183.0988618. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nWait, let me compute 3183 minus 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more, so 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, yes, 2865.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check with specific examples. Let's take n=319: 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(319*3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(1003.03) \u2248 0.000997, which is just above 0.001? Wait, no, 0.000997 is 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so that's within the interval (0.0001, 0.001).

    "text": " \n\nSo, for the equation sin(1/x) = 0, that should happen when 1/x = n\u03c0, right? So, solving for x, I can write x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, each x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n. Now, I need to find all such x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, I can set up the inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. \n\nLet me write that down: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. To find the range of n, I can invert the inequalities, remembering to reverse them when I do so. So, inverting all parts, I get 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those values: 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10,000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10,000. \n\nNow, dividing all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n, I get 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10,000/\u03c0. Let me compute those values numerically. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10,000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10,000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. \n\nSince n has to be an integer, I need to find the integers greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184. So, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183. \n\nNow, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think: the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. \n\nCalculating that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. So, 1000/\u03c0 is approximately 318.31, so the next integer is 319. Similarly, 10,000/\u03c0 is approximately 3183.098, so the largest integer less than that is 3183. So, from 319 to 3183 inclusive, the number of integers is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that seems correct. \n\nI should also consider whether the endpoints x = 0.0001 and x = 0.001 are included. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so the endpoints themselves are not included. Therefore, I don't need to worry about including n such that x equals exactly 0.0001 or 0.001, which would correspond to n = 10,000/\u03c0 or n = 1000/\u03c0, which are not integers anyway. \n\nAnother thing to check: is there any integer n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001 or 0.001? Let me see: 0.0001 is 1/10000, so 1/(n\u03c0) = 1/10000 implies n = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, which isn't an integer. Similarly, 0.001 is 1/1000, so 1/(n\u03c0) = 1/1000 implies n = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, which isn't an integer either. So, no x-intercepts exactly at the endpoints, so our count remains 2865. \n\nWait, but let me think again: the function y = sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0, so between 0.0001 and 0.001, it's going to oscillate a lot. Each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the sine function completes a half-period, leading to an intercept. So, each increment in n by 1 corresponds to an intercept. So, the number of intercepts should be approximately the number of times 1/x passes through n\u03c0 as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001. \n\nWait, but as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000. So, 1/x goes from 10000 down to 1000, so n\u03c0 goes from 10000 down to 1000. So, the number of n's is the number of integers between 1000 and 10000, but wait, that can't be right because 10000 is larger than 1000. Wait, no, 1/x decreases, so n\u03c0 goes from 10000 down to 1000, meaning n goes from 10000/\u03c0 down to 1000/\u03c0, so the number of n's is the same as from 1000/\u03c0 to 10000/\u03c0, which is 3183.098 down to 318.309, but since n must be an integer, we take n from 319 up to 3183, which gives 2865 intercepts. \n\nWait, but let me think again: when x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000, so each time 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0, that's an intercept. So, the number of intercepts is the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. So, the smallest n where n\u03c0 \u2265 1000 is n = 319, since 318\u03c0 \u2248 1000.06, which is just above 1000. Similarly, the largest n where n\u03c0 \u2264 10000 is n = 3183, since 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.96, which is just below 10000. So, the number of n's is from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. \n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake earlier when I said 1000/\u03c0 is approximately 318.31, so n starts at 319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 is approximately 3183.098, so n ends at 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that's correct. \n\nBut wait, let me check with a small example to make sure. Suppose I have an interval (a, b) where a = 1/(n1\u03c0) and b = 1/(n2\u03c0), and I want to find the number of x-intercepts between them. So, the number of n's would be from n2 + 1 to n1 - 1, depending on whether a is larger or smaller than b. Wait, in our case, a = 0.0001, which is smaller than b = 0.001, so 1/a = 10000, which is larger than 1/b = 1000. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, which is correct. \n\nWait, but if I take n from 319 to 3183, that's 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that should be the number of x-intercepts. \n\nWait, but let me check another way: the distance between consecutive zeros of sin(1/x) is when 1/x increases by \u03c0, so the change in x is from 1/(n\u03c0) to 1/((n+1)\u03c0). So, the difference in x between two consecutive intercepts is 1/(n\u03c0) - 1/((n+1)\u03c0) = (n+1 - n)/(\u03c0(n)(n+1)) ) = 1/(\u03c0n(n+1)). So, the spacing between zeros is 1/(\u03c0n(n+1)). \n\nBut maybe that's more detailed than I need right now. The key point is that each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept in the interval, and the number of such n's is 2865. \n\nWait, but let me think again: 1000/\u03c0 is approximately 318.309886184, so the smallest integer n is 319. 10000/\u03c0 is approximately 3183.09886184, so the largest integer n is 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. \n\nWait, but 3183 - 319 is 2864. So, 2864 + 1 is 2865. That seems correct. \n\nWait, but let me think about it differently: the number of integers between a and b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319, b is 3183. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that's correct. \n\nWait, but to make sure, let me take a smaller example. Suppose I have the interval (0.0005, 0.0006). Then, 1/x would be between 1666.666... and 2000. So, n\u03c0 would be between 1666.666 and 2000. So, n would be from ceil(1666.666/\u03c0) to floor(2000/\u03c0). Let me compute those: 1666.666/\u03c0 \u2248 530.5, so n starts at 531. 2000/\u03c0 \u2248 636.619, so n ends at 636. So, the number of n's is 636 - 531 + 1 = 106. Let me check: 636 - 531 is 105, plus 1 is 106. So, that seems correct. \n\nSo, applying the same logic to the original problem, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. \n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the initial setup. So, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, for x in (0.0001, 0.001), 1/x is in (1000, 10000). So, n\u03c0 must be in (1000, 10000). So, n must be in (1000/\u03c0, 10000/\u03c0), which is approximately (318.309, 3183.098). So, the integer values of n are from 319 to 3183, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. \n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I think the answer is 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). For x in (0.0001, 0.001), 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. Thus, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, leading to n between approximately 319 and 3183. The number of integers in this range is 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

    "text": " \n\nBut in this case, \u03b8 is 1/x. So, setting sin(1/x) = 0 gives 1/x = n\u03c0, which implies x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, every x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n. Now, I need to find all such x that lie within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nWait, let me make sure I understand the interval correctly. It's from 0.0001 to 0.001, but since it's an open interval, it doesn't include the endpoints. So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. \n\nSo, substituting x = 1/(n\u03c0) into the inequality, I get 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Now, I can solve for n to find the range of integers that satisfy this inequality. \n\nLet me write that down:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nI can take reciprocals on all parts, but I have to remember that taking reciprocals reverses the inequalities. So, taking reciprocals gives:\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nCalculating those values:\n\n1/0.001 = 1000\n\n1/0.0001 = 10000\n\nSo, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nNow, dividing all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nLet me compute these values. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. \n\nCalculating 1000/\u03c0:\n\n1000 \u00f7 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184\n\nCalculating 10000/\u03c0:\n\n10000 \u00f7 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183. \n\nNow, to find how many integers are between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, actually, let me think carefully. If I have integers from a to b inclusive, the number of integers is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\n2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, 3183 - 319. Let's compute 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I did the initial inequality correctly. The x-intercepts are at x = 1/(n\u03c0), so for each integer n, we get an x-intercept. We need x to be between 0.0001 and 0.001, so 1/(n\u03c0) must be between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, n must be such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. \n\nWait, when I take reciprocals, the inequalities reverse, so 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n\u03c0 < 10000, and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n\u03c0 > 1000. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which is the same as 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think about whether 3183 is included. Since n must be less than 3183.09886184, the maximum integer n is 3183 because 3183 < 3183.09886184. Similarly, n must be greater than 318.309886184, so the smallest integer n is 319. So, yes, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, that seems like a lot. Let me think if that's correct.\n\nWait, 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, that's correct. But let me check with specific numbers to see if this makes sense.\n\nFor example, let's take n=319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1004.3) \u2248 0.0009957, which is greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001.\n\nSimilarly, n=3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10001.1) \u2248 0.00009999, which is just below 0.0001, but wait, that's less than 0.0001, so actually, x=1/(3183\u03c0) would be less than 0.0001, which is outside the interval. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, no, because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10001.1, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so that x is outside the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, actually, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included in the interval.\n\nWait, so maybe my earlier calculation is off. Because n must be such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which is equivalent to n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included in the interval.\n\nWait, so that means that the maximum n for which x=1/(n\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001 is n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, the maximum integer n is 3183, but when n=3183, x is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the maximum n is actually 3182, because 3182\u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.14159265 \u2248 10000 - let me compute 3182 * 3.14159265.\n\nWait, 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.14159265 \u2248 Let me compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 182\u03c0 \u2248 571.864, so total \u2248 9424.77796 + 571.864 \u2248 9996.642. So, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9996.642, so 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.642 \u2248 0.000100034, which is just above 0.0001, so x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100034, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval.\n\nSimilarly, n=3183: 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10001.1, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded.\n\nSo, the maximum n is 3182. Similarly, the minimum n is 319 because when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1004.3) \u2248 0.0009957, which is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nWait, but 0.0009957 is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, n=319 gives x\u22480.0009957, which is within (0.0001, 0.001). Now, n=318: x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1001.5) \u2248 0.0009985, which is also within the interval. Wait, but 318\u03c0 is approximately 1001.5, so 1/1001.5 \u2248 0.0009985, which is still greater than 0.0001, so n=318 would also give x within the interval. Hmm, but earlier I thought the lower bound was n=319, but now I'm seeing that n=318 also gives x within the interval.\n\nWait, so perhaps my initial calculation of n starting at 319 was incorrect. Let me go back.\n\nWe have 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be an integer greater than 318.309886184, so the smallest integer n is 319, as I initially thought. But wait, when n=318, n\u03c0 \u2248 318 * 3.14159265 \u2248 1001.5, which is greater than 1000, so 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009985, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, why is n=318 included?\n\nWait, no, because 318 is less than 318.309886184, so n=318 would give n\u03c0 \u2248 1001.5, which is greater than 1000, so 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009985, which is less than 0.001, so x=0.0009985 is within (0.0001, 0.001). So, that would mean that n=318 also satisfies the condition, which contradicts my earlier thought that n must be greater than 318.309886184.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the inequality. Let me go back.\n\nWe have x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nWhich implies 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nSo, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, n must be an integer such that 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184.\n\nTherefore, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest integer n is 3183, because 3183 < 3183.09886184, so n=3183 is included.\n\nWait, but earlier when I took n=318, n\u03c0 \u2248 1001.5, which is greater than 1000, so 1/(n\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009985, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, n=318 also gives x within the interval, but 318 is less than 318.309886184, so according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309886184, so n=318 is less than that, which would imply that 1/(n\u03c0) > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, but wait, that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the direction of the inequality. Let me re-express the inequalities step by step.\n\nGiven that x is in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < x < 0.001.\n\nBut x = 1/(n\u03c0), so substituting, we get:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nTaking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities):\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nTherefore, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 and less than 10000/\u03c0.\n\nCalculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184\n\nCalculating 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, n must be an integer strictly greater than 318.309886184 and strictly less than 3183.09886184.\n\nTherefore, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest integer n is 3183.\n\nWait, but earlier when I took n=318, n\u03c0 \u2248 1001.5, which is greater than 1000, so 1/(n\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009985, which is within (0.0001, 0.001). So, why is n=318 not included?\n\nAh, I see the confusion. The inequality is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so n\u03c0 must be greater than 1000, not greater than or equal to. So, n must be such that n\u03c0 > 1000, which is n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184. Therefore, n must be greater than 318.309886184, so the smallest integer n is 319.\n\nSimilarly, n\u03c0 must be less than 10000, so n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so the largest integer n is 3183, because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10001.1, which is greater than 10000, so n=3183 gives n\u03c0 \u2248 10001.1, which is greater than 10000, so 1/(n\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9996.642, which is less than 10000, so 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100034, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nWait, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier by including n=3183. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which translates to n > 318.309886184 and n < 3183.09886184.\n\nTherefore, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest integer n is 3183, but we have to check if n=3183 gives x within the interval.\n\nWait, n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9996.642, which is less than 10000, so x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100034, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nSimilarly, n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009957, which is less than 0.001, so included.\n\nWait, so now I'm confused because earlier I thought n=318 was giving x within the interval, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309886184, so n=318 is less than that, which would mean x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009985, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. So, perhaps my initial inequality was wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Instead of taking reciprocals and flipping the inequalities, maybe I should solve for n in terms of x.\n\nGiven that x is in (0.0001, 0.001), and x=1/(n\u03c0), so n=1/(x\u03c0). So, for x in (0.0001, 0.001), n=1/(x\u03c0) must be an integer.\n\nSo, when x approaches 0.0001 from above, n approaches 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nWhen x approaches 0.001 from below, n approaches 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184.\n\nSo, as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, n decreases from approximately 3183.09886184 to 318.309886184.\n\nTherefore, n must be an integer between 319 and 3183 inclusive, because n must be less than 3183.09886184 and greater than 318.309886184.\n\nWait, but when x=0.0001, n=10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, which is not an integer, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100034 > 0.0001.\n\nSimilarly, the minimum n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 is n=319, because 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009957 < 0.001.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Now, let's compute how many integers are in that range.\n\nNumber of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1.\n\nSo, 3182 - 319 + 1 = ?\n\nCalculating 3182 - 319:\n\n3182 - 300 = 2882\n\n2882 - 19 = 2863\n\nThen, 2863 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, so that's 2864 integers. But earlier I thought it was 2865. Hmm, so which is correct?\n\nWait, if n starts at 319 and ends at 3182, then the number of terms is 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3182 - 319 = 2863\n\n2863 + 1 = 2864.\n\nSo, that's 2864 integers.\n\nWait, but earlier when I took n from 319 to 3183, I got 2865, but since n=3183 is excluded, it's actually 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with smaller numbers to see if my formula is correct.\n\nFor example, how many integers from 5 to 8 inclusive? 5,6,7,8: that's 4 numbers. Using the formula: 8 -5 +1=4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, from 5 to 7 inclusive: 5,6,7: 3 numbers. 7-5 +1=3. Correct.\n\nSo, applying the same formula, from 319 to 3182 inclusive: 3182 - 319 +1=2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier when I took n=318, I saw that x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.0009985, which is within (0.0001, 0.001). So, why isn't n=318 included?\n\nBecause according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309886184, so n=318 is less than that, which would imply that x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.0009985, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's within the interval. So, that suggests that n=318 is also a valid solution, which contradicts the earlier calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the inequality.\n\nWait, let's go back. The inequality is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nSo, n must satisfy both n\u03c0 > 1000 and n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nSo, n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184\n\nand\n\nn < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nTherefore, n must be an integer strictly greater than 318.309886184 and strictly less than 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest integer n is 3183, but we have to check if n=3183 satisfies n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nWait, n=3183: 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 Let me compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 183\u03c0 \u2248 574.516, so total \u2248 9424.77796 + 574.516 \u2248 9999.29396, which is less than 10000. So, n=3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.29396 < 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.29396 \u2248 0.000100007, which is just above 0.0001, so x=0.000100007 is within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n=3183 is included.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10001.1, but that's incorrect. Let me recalculate 3183 * \u03c0 more accurately.\n\n3183 * \u03c0:\n\nLet me compute 3000 * \u03c0 = 9424.77796077\n\n183 * \u03c0:\n\n183 * 3 = 549\n\n183 * 0.14159265 \u2248 183 * 0.14159265 \u2248 Let's compute 180 * 0.14159265 \u2248 25.486677, and 3 * 0.14159265 \u2248 0.42477795, so total \u2248 25.486677 + 0.42477795 \u2248 25.911455.\n\nSo, 183\u03c0 \u2248 549 + 25.911455 \u2248 574.911455.\n\nSo, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796077 + 574.911455 \u2248 9999.68941577.\n\nSo, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.68941577, which is less than 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.68941577 \u2248 0.000100003, which is just above 0.0001, so x=0.000100003 is within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 is included.\n\nSimilarly, n=3184: 3184\u03c0 \u2248 3184 * 3.14159265 \u2248 Let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796077, 184\u03c0 \u2248 184 * 3.14159265 \u2248 184 * 3 = 552, 184 * 0.14159265 \u2248 26.054, so total \u2248 552 + 26.054 \u2248 578.054. So, 3184\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796077 + 578.054 \u2248 10002.83196077, which is greater than 10000, so 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/10002.83196077 \u2248 0.000099971, which is less than 0.0001, so excluded.\n\nTherefore, n=3183 is the maximum n that gives x within the interval.\n\nSimilarly, n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 1004.30988618, which is greater than 1000, so 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009957, which is less than 0.001, so included.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = ?\n\nCalculating 3183 - 319:\n\n3183 - 300 = 2883\n\n2883 - 19 = 2864\n\nThen, 2864 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, so that gives 2865 integers. But earlier, when I thought n=3183 was excluded, I got 2864, but now I see that n=3183 is included because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.689 < 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100003 > 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nTherefore, the correct number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000100003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included, and n=319 gives x\u22480.0009957, which is less than 0.001, so included. So, the total number is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check with n=3183: x\u22480.000100003, which is within (0.0001, 0.001). So, included.\n\nn=3184: x\u22480.000099971, which is less than 0.0001, so excluded.\n\nSimilarly, n=318: x\u22480.0009985, which is within the interval, but n=318 is less than 318.309886184, so according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309886184, so n=318 is excluded. Therefore, the smallest n is 319.\n\nWait, but n=318: 318\u03c0 \u2248 1001.5, which is greater than 1000, so 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009985 < 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, why is n=318 excluded?\n\nWait, because according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309886184, so n=318 is less than that, so it's excluded. But when n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.0009985, which is within the interval. So, that seems contradictory.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misapplying the inequality. Let me re-express it.\n\nWe have x=1/(n\u03c0) must be in (0.0001, 0.001). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nWhich implies:\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nWhich implies:\n\nn > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184\n\nand\n\nn < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184.\n\nTherefore, n=318 is less than 318.309886184, so it's excluded, even though 1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.0009985 is within the interval. So, that seems like a problem because n=318 gives x within the interval but is excluded by the inequality.\n\nWait, perhaps the error is that when I took reciprocals, I should have considered the direction of the inequality correctly. Let me check that again.\n\nGiven that x is in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < x < 0.001.\n\nBut x=1/(n\u03c0), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nTaking reciprocals:\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < "

Now, I need to find all such x that lie within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nLet me write down the inequalities for x:\n\n0.0001 < x < 0.001\n\nBut x = 1/(n\u03c0), so substituting that in:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nI can rewrite these inequalities to solve for n. Let's take the first inequality:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0)\n\nIf I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that flipping inequalities when taking reciprocals (since both sides are positive), it becomes:\n\n1/0.0001 > n\u03c0\n\nWhich is:\n\n10000 > n\u03c0\n\nSo, n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nSimilarly, for the second inequality:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nAgain, taking reciprocals:\n\nn\u03c0 > 1/0.001\n\nWhich is:\n\nn\u03c0 > 1000\n\nSo, n > 1000/\u03c0\n\nNow, let me compute these numerical values to find the range of n.\n\nFirst, compute 1000/\u03c0:\n\n\u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 1000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184\n\nSimilarly, 10000 / \u03c0 is 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSince n has to be an integer, n must be greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, n can take integer values starting from the next integer after 318.309886184, which is 319, up to the integer just below 3183.09886184, which is 3183.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. When I take reciprocals, the direction of the inequality flips because I'm dealing with positive numbers. So, for 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0), taking reciprocals gives 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0, which is correct, and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 gives n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is also correct.\n\nSo, n must satisfy:\n\n319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183\n\nBut wait, let me check. If n starts at 319, then x would be 1/(319\u03c0). Let me compute that to ensure it's within the interval.\n\nCalculating 1/(319\u03c0):\n\nFirst, 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.14159265 \u2248 1003.323. So, 1/1003.323 \u2248 0.0009966. Hmm, 0.0009966 is approximately 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so that's good. But wait, 0.000997 is greater than 0.0001, so that's within the interval.\n\nSimilarly, for n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0). Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 10000.0001, so 1/(10000.0001) \u2248 0.000099999, which is just less than 0.0001, but wait, our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001. So, if x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099999, that's less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. Therefore, n = 3183 gives x just below 0.0001, which is not in our interval. So, n must be less than or equal to 3182.\n\nWait, let me check n = 3182. Then x = 1/(3182\u03c0). Let's compute 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.14159265 \u2248 10000 - (3183\u03c0 - 3182\u03c0) = 10000 - \u03c0 \u2248 10000 - 3.14159265 \u2248 9996.8584. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 3182\u03c0 is less than 3183\u03c0. Let me compute 3182\u03c0 more accurately.\n\nWait, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.0001, so 3182\u03c0 = 3183\u03c0 - \u03c0 \u2248 10000.0001 - 3.14159265 \u2248 9996.8585. So, x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.8585 \u2248 0.00010003, which is just over 0.0001, so that's within our interval.\n\nWait, but 1/9996.8585 is approximately 0.00010003, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's inside the interval. So, n can go up to 3182, because n=3183 gives x just below 0.0001, which is outside.\n\nWait, let me confirm this calculation because it's a bit confusing. Let's compute 3183 * \u03c0:\n\n3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 Let me compute 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, then 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 575.2219. So, adding them together: 9424.77796 + 575.2219 \u2248 10000.000, so 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.000, which makes 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 exactly. But our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.0001, so x must be greater than 0.0001. Therefore, n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so the maximum n is 3182.\n\nSimilarly, for the lower bound, n must be greater than 318.309886184, so the smallest integer n is 319.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nNow, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3182 inclusive, we can compute 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\nLet me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, 2864 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake with the bounds.\n\nFirst, n starts at 319 because n > 318.309886184, so n=319 is the first integer. Then, n ends at 3182 because n=3183 would give x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded. So, n goes up to 3182.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nBut wait, let me check with a smaller example to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Suppose I have numbers from 5 to 8 inclusive. The count is 8 - 5 + 1 = 4, which is correct: 5,6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly, from 319 to 3182: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me also check the endpoints again. For n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.323) \u2248 0.0009966, which is less than 0.001 and greater than 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nFor n=3182, x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(9996.8585) \u2248 0.00010003, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nWait, but 0.00010003 is approximately 0.00010003, which is 1.0003 \u00d7 10^-4, which is indeed greater than 0.0001, so it's within the interval.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me check if I did the calculation correctly for 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\n3182 minus 319: Let me compute 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863. Then, 2863 + 1 = 2864. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another approach: The number of integers from 1 to 3182 is 3182. The number of integers from 1 to 318 is 318. So, the number from 319 to 3182 is 3182 - 318 = 2864. That's another way to see it, which confirms the same result.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me think again: Each x-intercept occurs at x=1/(n\u03c0) for integer n. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept, as long as 1/(n\u03c0) lies within that interval. So, the count is the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is between 0.0001 and 0.001.\n\nWhich we've established is when n is between 319 and 3182 inclusive, giving 2864 intercepts.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3182 - 319 + 1 again:\n\n3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 is 2864. Yep.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula: Number of terms = (Last - First)/Common difference + 1. Here, the common difference is 1, so it's just (3182 - 319) + 1 = 2864.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

    "text": " \n\nGiven that y = sin(1/x), setting y to zero gives sin(1/x) = 0. So, 1/x must be equal to n\u03c0, where n is an integer. Therefore, solving for x, we get x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer values of n. Now, I need to find all such x that lie within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nLet me write down the inequalities to find the range of n. The interval is 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Substituting x = 1/(n\u03c0), we get:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nI can rewrite these inequalities to solve for n. Let's start with the left inequality:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0)\n\nMultiplying both sides by n\u03c0 (which is positive, so the inequality sign doesn't change):\n\n0.0001 * n\u03c0 < 1\n\nDividing both sides by 0.0001:\n\nn\u03c0 < 1 / 0.0001\n\nCalculating 1 / 0.0001, which is 10000, so:\n\nn\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing both sides by \u03c0:\n\nn < 10000 / \u03c0\n\nSimilarly, for the right inequality:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nMultiplying both sides by n\u03c0:\n\n1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0\n\nDividing both sides by 0.001:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0\n\nDividing both sides by \u03c0:\n\nn > 1000 / \u03c0\n\nNow, let me compute the numerical values of these bounds to find the range of n.\n\nFirst, 10000 / \u03c0. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so:\n\n10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSimilarly, 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184\n\nSo, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886 and less than approximately 3183.09886.\n\nSince n must be an integer, n can take integer values from the next integer greater than 318.309886, which is 319, up to the integer less than 3183.09886, which is 3183.\n\nNow, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 319 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included).\n\nSo, number of integers = 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865.\n\nWait, let me check that subtraction again: 3183 minus 319. Let me compute 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865.\n\nSo, that suggests there are 2865 integer values of n, and thus 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. Let me verify the steps again.\n\nWe have x = 1/(n\u03c0), and x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001.\n\nSo, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nTaking reciprocals (and remembering that reversing inequalities when taking reciprocals because all terms are positive):\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDivide all parts by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nAs before, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.309886 and less than 3183.09886184.\n\nSince n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nLet me compute 3183 - 319:\n\n3183 - 300 = 2883\n\n2883 - 19 = 2864\n\nThen, 2864 + 1 = 2865.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nWait a second, but let me make sure that for n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) is indeed greater than 0.0001.\n\nCompute 1/(319\u03c0):\n\n1/(319 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(1003.09886184) \u2248 0.000996935.\n\nWait, that's approximately 0.000996935, which is greater than 0.0001, so that's good.\n\nSimilarly, for n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.09886184) \u2248 0.00009999902, which is just under 0.0001, but wait, our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001. So, does 0.00009999902 count? No, because it's less than 0.0001. Therefore, n=3183 would give x\u22480.00009999902, which is less than 0.0001, so it doesn't lie in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 is too low.\n\nWait, that suggests that the upper bound for n is such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, so n must be less than 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.09886184, but since n must be an integer, the maximum n is 3183, but as I saw, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999902, which is less than 0.0001. So, that x is not in the interval. Therefore, the maximum n for which x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3183 gives x\u22480.00009999902, which is less than 0.0001, so it doesn't qualify. So, actually, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nWait, let me check n=3182:\n\nx=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000 - 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(9996.85840735) \u2248 0.0001000314.\n\nWait, that's approximately 0.0001000314, which is greater than 0.0001, so that's acceptable. So, n=3182 gives x\u22480.0001000314, which is within the interval.\n\nSimilarly, n=3183 gives x\u22480.00009999902, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded.\n\nTherefore, n can go up to 3182.\n\nSimilarly, let's check n=319:\n\nx=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.09886184) \u2248 0.000996935, which is less than 0.001, so that's acceptable.\n\nWait, but 0.000996935 is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 0.000996935 is indeed less than 0.001, so yes, it's within (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nNow, so n starts at 319 and goes up to 3182.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\nCompute 3182 - 319:\n\n3182 - 300 = 2882\n\n2882 - 19 = 2863\n\nThen, 2863 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, so that's different from before. So, previously I thought n went up to 3183, but that gives x just below 0.0001, which is excluded. So, the maximum n is 3182, which gives x just above 0.0001, which is included.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865, but since n=3183 is excluded, it's 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, let me check with n=319 and n=3182.\n\nn=319: x\u22480.000996935, which is within (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nn=3182: x\u22480.0001000314, which is within (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nn=3183: x\u22480.00009999902, which is less than 0.0001, so excluded.\n\nTherefore, the number of n's is from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nSo, the count is 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882; 2882 - 19 = 2863.\n\nThen, 2863 + 1 = 2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me think again.\n\nThe x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0), where n is a positive integer.\n\nWe need x to satisfy 0.0001 < x < 0.001.\n\nSo, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nTaking reciprocals (and flipping the inequalities):\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDivide by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.309886 and less than 3183.09886184.\n\nSince n must be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319, and the largest possible n is 3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x\u22480.00009999902, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded.\n\nTherefore, the maximum n is 3182, which gives x\u22480.0001000314, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nNow, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive, we can compute 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\nCompute 3182 - 319:\n\n3182 - 300 = 2882\n\n2882 - 19 = 2863\n\nThen, 2863 + 1 = 2864.\n\nSo, that's 2864 integers, meaning 2864 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but let me check another way. The number of integers between a and b inclusive is b - a + 1.\n\nSo, from 319 to 3182, the number is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, the number of integers between m and n inclusive is n - m + 1.\n\nSo, 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865, but since n=3183 is excluded, it's actually 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me consider specific examples.\n\nTake n=319: x\u22480.000996935, which is within (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nn=3182: x\u22480.0001000314, which is within (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nn=3183: x\u22480.00009999902, which is less than 0.0001, so not included.\n\nTherefore, the number of n's is from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Solving for x gives x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Thus, n ranges from 319 to 3182, giving 2864 intercepts.\n\n\\boxed{2864}"

    "text": " \n\nGiven that y = sin(1/x), setting this equal to zero gives sin(1/x) = 0. Therefore, 1/x must be equal to n\u03c0 for some integer n. So, 1/x = n\u03c0 implies that x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, every x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n. \n\nNow, I need to find all such x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, I can write this as 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), substituting, I get 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. I need to solve this inequality for n to find the range of integers n that satisfy this condition.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nI can rewrite this as two separate inequalities:\n\n1. 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001\n2. 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nLet me solve each inequality for n.\n\nStarting with the first inequality:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001\n\nMultiplying both sides by n\u03c0 (which is positive, so the inequality sign doesn't change):\n\n1 > 0.0001 * n\u03c0\n\nThen, divide both sides by 0.0001:\n\n1 / 0.0001 > n\u03c0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n10000 > n\u03c0\n\nSo, n < 10000 / \u03c0\n\nCalculating 10000 / \u03c0: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, n < approximately 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, n \u2264 3183.\n\nNow, solving the second inequality:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nAgain, multiply both sides by n\u03c0:\n\n1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by 0.001:\n\n1 / 0.001 < n\u03c0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0\n\nSo, n > 1000 / \u03c0\n\nCalculating 1000 / \u03c0: 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184\n\nSince n must be an integer, n \u2265 319.\n\nSo, combining both inequalities, n must satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183.\n\nNow, I need to find how many integers are in this range.

Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, starting with 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so n must be less than that, so the largest integer n is 3183. Then, 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so the smallest integer n is 319. Then, 3183 - 319 = 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865.

Wait, no, 0.0001 is 0.0001, which is 1e-4. 0.000099999 is 9.9999e-5, which is less than 1e-4, so it's actually just below 0.0001, which would be outside the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Hmm, so maybe n = 3183 gives x just below 0.0001, which is outside the interval. So, perhaps I need to adjust the upper limit.\n\nWait, that would mean that the maximum n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001.\n\nSo, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001\n\nWhich implies n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nSo, n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, n can be up to 3183, but x at n=3183 is 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0988618) \u2248 0.000099999, which is less than 0.0001. So, that would be outside the interval.\n\nWait, so actually, the maximum n where x = 1/(n\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001 is n where 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which is n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be less than that, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but when n=3183, x is just below 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. Therefore, the maximum n that satisfies x > 0.0001 is n where 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which is n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n can be up to 3183, but at n=3183, x is just below 0.0001, so that's not included. So, the maximum n is 3183 - 1 = 3182?\n\nWait, let me check: n=3183 gives x\u22480.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside. So, the maximum n such that x > 0.0001 is n where 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, so n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n can be up to 3183, but x at n=3183 is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, the maximum n is 3182, where x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000 - \u03c0) \u2248 1/(9996.8584073) \u2248 0.000100032, which is just above 0.0001, so that's included.\n\nWait, but let me calculate 1/(3182\u03c0):\n\n3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 182\u03c0 \u2248 571.896, so total \u2248 9424.77796 + 571.896 \u2248 9996.67396. So, 1/9996.67396 \u2248 0.000100034, which is approximately 0.000100034, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nSo, n=3182 gives x\u22480.000100034, which is within (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nSimilarly, n=3183 gives x\u22480.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded.\n\nTherefore, the upper bound for n is 3182, not 3183.\n\nSimilarly, let's check the lower bound. n=319 gives x\u22480.0009976, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. n=318 gives x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.53) \u2248 0.00099947, which is approximately 0.00099947, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Wait, but 0.00099947 is 0.00099947, which is just below 0.001, so it's included in (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but let me check n=318: 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.53) \u2248 0.00099947, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. But wait, 0.00099947 is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval.\n\nWait, but when I solved the inequality earlier, I got n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so n \u2265 319. So, n=319 is the smallest integer where x=1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nWait, let me check n=319: 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.31) \u2248 0.0009976, which is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nn=318: 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099947, which is less than 0.001, so it's included as well.\n\nWait, but according to the inequality, n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so n must be greater than 318.309886184, so the smallest integer n is 319. So, n=319 is the first integer where x=1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nWait, but 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099947, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, perhaps the inequality is n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so n must be 319 or higher. But when n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099947 < 0.001, so it's included. So, perhaps the correct lower bound is n \u2265 319, but n=318 also gives x < 0.001, so maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me go back to the inequality:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nWhich implies n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.309886184, so the smallest integer n is 319. So, n=319 is the first integer where x=1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nWait, but 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099947, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, perhaps my initial approach was wrong. Maybe the inequality should be n \u2265 319, but n=318 also satisfies the condition. Hmm, perhaps I need to check more carefully.\n\nWait, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so n must be greater than 318.309886184, so the smallest integer n is 319. So, n=319 is the smallest integer where x=1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nBut when n=318, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099947 < 0.001, so it's included. So, perhaps my initial approach was wrong. Maybe the inequality is n \u2265 319, but n=318 also satisfies the condition, so perhaps I need to adjust.\n\nWait, let me solve the inequality again:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0:\n\n1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by 0.001:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0\n\nThen, n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.309886184, so the smallest integer n is 319.\n\nBut when n=318, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099947 < 0.001, so it's included. So, perhaps my initial approach was wrong, and n can be as low as 319, but n=318 also satisfies the condition. Hmm, maybe I need to check.\n\nWait, let me compute 1/(318\u03c0):\n\n318 * \u03c0 \u2248 318 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 1000.53096491\n\nSo, 1/1000.53096491 \u2248 0.00099947, which is indeed less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nBut according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309886184, so n=318 is less than that, so it shouldn't satisfy the inequality. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the inequality direction.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0 (positive, so inequality remains):\n\n1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0\n\nThen, divide both sides by 0.001:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0\n\nSo, n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.309886184, so the smallest integer n is 319.\n\nBut when n=318, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099947 < 0.001, so it's included. So, that suggests that the inequality is not strict for n=318, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309886184, so n=318 is less than that, so it shouldn't satisfy the inequality. But in reality, when n=318, 1/(n\u03c0) is less than 0.001, so it does satisfy the condition. So, perhaps my initial approach was wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me consider that for x in (0.0001, 0.001), 1/x is in (1000, 10000). So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000.\n\nSince sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so n\u03c0 must be in (1000, 10000). Therefore, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nSo, solving for n:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDivide all parts by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nWhich is approximately:\n\n318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184\n\nSo, n must be an integer strictly greater than 318.309886184 and strictly less than 3183.09886184.\n\nTherefore, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest integer n is 3183, since 3183 is less than 3183.09886184, but 3184 would be 3184\u03c0 \u2248 10000.26, which is greater than 10000, so it's outside the interval.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. So, perhaps the upper limit is n=3182.\n\nWait, let me check: 3183\u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 183\u03c0 \u2248 574.7856, so total \u2248 9424.77796 + 574.7856 \u2248 9999.56356, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.56356 \u2248 0.000100004, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier calculation.

So, perhaps n=3183 is included because x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100003 > 0.0001, so it's within the interval.\n\nWait, then earlier when I thought n=3183 gave x\u22480.000099999, that was incorrect. It's actually approximately 0.000100003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nSimilarly, n=3184: 3184\u03c0 \u2248 3184 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute:\n\n3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796\n\n184\u03c0 \u2248 578.5201 (since 180\u03c0\u2248565.4866776 and 4\u03c0\u224812.56637061, so 565.4866776 + 12.56637061 \u2248 578.0530482)\n\nSo, 3000\u03c0 + 184\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796 + 578.0530482 \u2248 999,  let's see: 9424 + 578 = 999, 0.77796 + 0.0530482 \u2248 0.8310082\n\nWait, actually, 9424.77796 + 578.0530482 \u2248 999, let's compute 9424 + 578 = 999, but that's not correct because 9424 + 578 = 999, but 9424 + 578 is actually 999, but let's check:\n\nWait, 9424.77796 + 578.0530482 = 9424.77796 + 578.0530482 = let's add the thousands: 9000 + 500 = 9500, 424.77796 + 78.0530482 = 502.8310082, so total is 9500 + 502.8310082 \u2248 10002.8310082.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 3184 is greater than 3183, so 3184\u03c0 should be greater than 3183\u03c0 \u22489999.68941556.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the breakdown.

Wait, 3184\u03c0 \u2248 10002.8310082.\n\nSo, 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/10002.8310082 \u2248 0.000099971, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded.\n\nTherefore, n=3184 gives x\u22480.000099971 < 0.0001, so it's excluded.\n\nSo, the maximum n is 3183, because n=3183 gives x\u22480.000100003 > 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n=3183 gives x\u22480.000100003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. So, the maximum n is 3183.\n\nSo, now, the range of n is from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\n2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nSo, there are 2865 integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that n=3183 gives x\u22480.000100003, which is included, and n=3184 gives x\u22480.000099971, which is excluded. So, n goes up to 3183.\n\nSimilarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.0009976 < 0.001, so it's included.\n\nWait, but let me check n=318: 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099947 < 0.001, so it's included. But according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309886184, so n=319 is the first integer.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me just go with the initial calculation: the number of integers n where 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183 is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that n=3183 gives x\u22480.000100003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. So, that should be correct.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\nWe need to find the number of x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nEach x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0), where n is an integer.\n\nWe need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nThis translates to 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nDividing by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nCalculating:\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184\n\n10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, n must be an integer strictly greater than 318.309886184 and strictly less than 3183.09886184.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nNumber of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nI think that's correct.

    "text": " \n\nSo, if I set sin(1/x) equal to zero, that means 1/x must be equal to n\u03c0, right? So, 1/x = n\u03c0, which implies that x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, every x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n. Now, I need to find all such x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nLet me write that down: 0.0001 < x < 0.001, which is the same as 10^{-4} < x < 10^{-3}. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), I can substitute this into the inequality. So, 10^{-4} < 1/(n\u03c0) < 10^{-3}. \n\nNow, I need to solve for n. Let me take the reciprocal of all parts, remembering that flipping the inequalities will reverse them because all terms are positive. So, 10^{3} > n\u03c0 > 10^{4}. Wait, let me double-check that. If 10^{-4} < 1/(n\u03c0), then taking reciprocals (and flipping inequalities) gives n\u03c0 < 10^{4}. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 10^{-3} implies n\u03c0 > 10^{3}. So, putting it together: 10^{3} < n\u03c0 < 10^{4}. \n\nTherefore, n must satisfy 10^{3}/\u03c0 < n < 10^{4}/\u03c0. Let me compute these values. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 10^3 is 1000, and 10^4 is 10,000. \n\nCalculating 1000/\u03c0: 1000 divided by 3.1415926535. Let me compute that. 1000 \u00f7 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10,000 \u00f7 \u03c0 \u2248 10,000 \u00f7 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. \n\nSo, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n can take integer values from the next integer after 318.309886184, which is 319, up to the integer less than 3183.09886184, which is 3183. \n\nSo, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. Now, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 319 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. \n\nWait, let me check that again. If I have numbers from a to b inclusive, the count is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319 first. 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. \n\nTherefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nBut wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the reciprocal step. When I had 10^{-4} < 1/(n\u03c0) < 10^{-3}, taking reciprocals would indeed flip the inequalities because I'm dealing with positive numbers. So, 10^{4} > n\u03c0 > 10^{3}, which is the same as 10^{3} < n\u03c0 < 10^{4}. That seems correct. \n\nAlso, when I calculated 1000/\u03c0, I got approximately 318.309886184, so the smallest integer n is 319. Similarly, 10,000/\u03c0 is approximately 3183.09886184, so the largest integer n is 3183. \n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. That seems correct. \n\nWait, another way to check: the number of integers between a and b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Yep, that's correct. \n\nSo, I think that's the answer. 2865 x-intercepts. \n\nBut just to make sure, let me consider the endpoints. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so it doesn't include the endpoints. So, x = 0.0001 and x = 0.001 are not included. But since x = 1/(n\u03c0), and n starts at 319, which gives x \u2248 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.5) \u2248 0.0009975, which is just below 0.001. Similarly, n = 3183 gives x \u2248 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10,000.0) \u2248 0.0001, which is just above 0.0001. So, these x-values are indeed within the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nWait, but hold on: 1/(319\u03c0) is approximately 1/(1002.5) \u2248 0.0009975, which is less than 0.001, so it's inside the interval. Similarly, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10,000) \u2248 0.0001, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's also inside the interval. So, both endpoints are included in the interval. \n\nTherefore, all the x-intercepts at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for n from 319 to 3183 are within (0.0001, 0.001). So, the count is 2865. \n\nI think that's solid. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10,000. Solving for n gives n from 319 to 3183, yielding 2865 intercepts.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so if I set sin(1/x) = 0, that means 1/x must be equal to some integer multiple of \u03c0. So, 1/x = n\u03c0, which implies that x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer values of n. \n\nNow, I need to find all such x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Let me write down the inequalities: 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), substituting that in gives 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. \n\nI can rewrite these inequalities to solve for n. Let's start with the left inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Taking reciprocals on both sides (and remembering that reversing the inequality when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive), we get 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Calculating 1/0.0001, that's 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Therefore, n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.098. So, n < approximately 3183.098. Since n has to be an integer, n can be at most 3183.\n\nNow, let's look at the right inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001. 1/0.001 is 1000, so n\u03c0 > 1000. Therefore, n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.3098. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.3098. Since n is an integer, the smallest n can be is 319.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to count how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the numbers, that's 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. \n\nWait, let me double-check that subtraction. 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then minus 19 more is 2864. Yeah, that's correct. So, 2864 + 1 is 2865. So, there are 2865 integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The original interval for x is (0.0001, 0.001). So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. When I found n, I considered n starting at 319 because n > 318.3098, so n=319 is the first integer. Similarly, n must be less than 3183.098, so n=3183 is the last integer. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. \n\nIs there a possibility that I missed any intercepts? Let me consider the endpoints. The interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), so it doesn't include the endpoints. So, x=0.0001 and x=0.001 are excluded. But since x=1/(n\u03c0), let's check what n would give x=0.0001 and x=0.001.\n\nFor x=0.0001: 0.0001 = 1/(n\u03c0) => n = 1/(0.0001 * \u03c0) \u2248 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n\u22483183.098, but since n must be integer, n=3183 gives x\u22481/(3183 * \u03c0)\u22480.00010003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, for x=0.001: 0.001 = 1/(n\u03c0) => n=1/(0.001 * \u03c0)\u22481000/\u03c0\u2248318.3098. So, n=318 would give x\u22481/(318 * \u03c0)\u22480.001003, which is just above 0.001, so it's not included. But n=319 gives x\u22481/(319 * \u03c0)\u22480.000996, which is below 0.001, so it's included. So, our range for n is correct: from 319 to 3183.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me check if n=3183 is included. So, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00010003, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. And n=319 gives x\u22480.000996, which is less than 0.001, so included. So, yes, the count from 319 to 3183 inclusive is correct.\n\nJust to make sure, let me think about how the function behaves. As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly between -1 and 1. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a small interval near zero, the function sin(1/x) will oscillate many times, crossing the x-axis each time it goes from positive to negative or vice versa. Each crossing corresponds to an x-intercept at x=1/(n\u03c0). So, the number of such crossings is indeed the number of integers n between 319 and 3183, which we calculated as 2865.\n\nI think that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, leading to x = 1/(n\u03c0). For x in (0.0001, 0.001), n ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 intercepts.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

Solving for x, I get x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer values of n.\n\nNow, I need to find how many such x-values lie within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Let me write down the inequalities:\n\n0.0001 < x < 0.001\n\nSubstituting x = 1/(n\u03c0) into these inequalities gives:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nI can rewrite these inequalities to solve for n. Let's start with the left inequality:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0)\n\nMultiplying both sides by n\u03c0 (since n is positive, as x is positive and less than 0.001, n must be positive):\n\n0.0001 * n\u03c0 < 1\n\nDividing both sides by 0.0001:\n\nn\u03c0 < 1 / 0.0001\n\nCalculating 1 / 0.0001, that's 10000.\n\nSo, n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nTherefore, n < 10000 / \u03c0\n\nCalculating 10000 / \u03c0, since \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSince n must be an integer, n \u2264 3183.\n\nNow, let's look at the right inequality:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nAgain, multiply both sides by n\u03c0:\n\n1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0\n\nDividing both sides by 0.001:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0\n\nSo, n > 1000 / \u03c0\n\nCalculating 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184\n\nSince n must be an integer, n \u2265 319.\n\nSo, putting it all together, n must satisfy:\n\n319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183\n\nNow, I need to find how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, plugging in:\n\n3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 = 2864; 2864 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, let me check that again. So, 3183 minus 319 is indeed 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. Let me double-check:\n\nStarting with x in (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001.\n\nSo, 1/x must be greater than 1000 and less than 10000, because 1/0.001 = 1000 and 1/0.0001 = 10000.\n\nSo, 1000 < 1/x < 10000.\n\nBut since 1/x = n\u03c0, that means:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing all parts by \u03c0:\n\n1000 / \u03c0 < n < 10000 / \u03c0\n\nWhich is approximately:\n\n318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184\n\nSince n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\n2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nSo, that's 2865 integers. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but let me think again. Does each integer n correspond to exactly one x-intercept? Yes, because for each n, x = 1/(n\u03c0) is a unique point in the interval. So, each n gives a distinct x-intercept.\n\nWait, but let me check the endpoints. The interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), so we don't include the endpoints. So, do we need to check if x = 1/(n\u03c0) equals exactly 0.0001 or 0.001?\n\nBut 0.0001 = 1/10000, so 1/x = 10000, which would correspond to n = 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, which is not an integer, so x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.001, and x = 1/(3184\u03c0) would be even smaller, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is still greater than 0.0001 because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 10000, but not exactly. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since it's an open interval, we don't include it. Wait, but in our calculation, n starts at 319, which gives x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.00098, which is less than 0.001, and greater than 0.0001. Similarly, n=3183 gives x \u2248 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010001, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval.\n\nWait, but 0.0001 is 10^{-4}, and 0.001 is 10^{-3}. So, x must be greater than 10^{-4} and less than 10^{-3}.\n\nSo, 1/x must be greater than 1000 and less than 10000, as I thought before.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so n starts at 319, and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so n ends at 3183.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that 3183\u03c0 is just under 10000. Let's compute 3183 * \u03c0.\n\n3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535.\n\nLet me compute 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796\n\nThen 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 574.6265\n\nSo, total is approximately 9424.77796 + 574.6265 \u2248 10,000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but since it's greater than 0.0001, it's included. Wait, but 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but slightly more because 3183\u03c0 is slightly less than 10,000. Wait, no: 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but if 3183\u03c0 is slightly less than 10,000, then 1/(3183\u03c0) would be slightly more than 0.0001, right? Because if the denominator is slightly less than 10,000, the fraction is slightly more than 0.0001.\n\nWait, let me compute 3183 * \u03c0 more accurately.\n\n3183 * \u03c0:\n\nLet me use a calculator approach.\n\n\u03c0 \u2248 3.141592653589793\n\nSo, 3183 * 3.141592653589793\n\nLet me compute 3000 * \u03c0 = 9424.77796076938\n\nThen 183 * \u03c0:\n\n183 * 3.141592653589793\n\nCompute 100 * \u03c0 = 314.1592653589793\n\n80 * \u03c0 = 251.3274122871834\n\n3 * \u03c0 = 9.42477796076938\n\nAdding up: 314.1592653589793 + 251.3274122871834 = 565.4866776461627\n\nThen +9.42477796076938 = 574.9114556069321\n\nSo, total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796076938 + 574.9114556069321 \u2248 10,000. (Because 9424.77796 + 574.911455 \u2248 9424.77796 + 574.911455 \u2248 9999.689415, which is just under 10,000.)\n\nSo, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.689415, which is just under 10,000.\n\nTherefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.689415 \u2248 0.00010000314, which is just over 0.0001.\n\nSo, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010000314, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nSimilarly, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.159) \u2248 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001, so it's included as well.\n\nSo, both endpoints are included, but the interval is open, so we don't include x=0.0001 or x=0.001, but since x=1/(3183\u03c0) is just over 0.0001, and x=1/(319\u03c0) is just under 0.001, both are within the interval.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check if n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010000314, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. And n=319 gives x\u22480.0009968, which is just below 0.001, so it's included as well.\n\nSo, the total number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the subtraction.\n\n3183 - 319:\n\n3183 - 300 = 2883\n\n2883 - 19 = 2864\n\nThen +1 gives 2865.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think that's the answer. There are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, leading to x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), we find n ranges from 319 to 3183, resulting in 2865 x-intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

    "text": " \n\nIn this case, \u03b8 is 1/x, so I can set up the equation 1/x = n\u03c0. Solving for x, that gives x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, each x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n. Now, I need to find all such x that lie within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nFirst, let me write down the inequalities that define this interval. So, 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), substituting that in, we get 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. I can rewrite these inequalities to solve for n. \n\nStarting with the left inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that taking reciprocals reverses the inequality, I get 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Calculating 1/0.0001, that's 10,000, so 10,000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, which is approximately 3.14159, I get n < 10,000 / \u03c0. Let me compute that: 10,000 / 3.14159 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.098.\n\nNow, the right inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n > 1000 / \u03c0. Calculating that, 1000 / 3.14159 \u2248 318.3098. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.3098.\n\nSince n must be an integer, n starts from the next integer after 318.3098, which is 319, and goes up to the integer just below 3183.098, which is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nNow, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, no, actually, if n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n in that range, which would correspond to 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 10,000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 3183.098, so n must be less than that, so the maximum integer n is 3183. Similarly, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 318.3098, so the minimum integer n is 319. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates more and more frequently as x approaches zero. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is very close to zero, the function should have a lot of oscillations, each crossing the x-axis twice (once going up, once going down), except possibly at the endpoints. But wait, actually, each time the argument 1/x increases by \u03c0, the sine function completes a half-period, so each x-intercept occurs when 1/x increases by \u03c0. So, the number of x-intercepts should be proportional to the length of the interval in terms of 1/x.\n\nWait, but in my earlier approach, I considered each x-intercept as occurring at x = 1/(n\u03c0), so each integer n corresponds to one x-intercept. So, from n=319 to n=3183, that's 2865 intercepts. But actually, between each two consecutive x-intercepts at x = 1/(n\u03c0) and x = 1/((n+1)\u03c0), the sine function goes from 0 up to 1, back to 0, down to -1, and back to 0, so that's two full periods, meaning two x-intercepts. Wait, no, actually, each time n increases by 1, the x-intercept moves closer to zero, so each x-intercept is a single point where the function crosses zero. So, each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept.\n\nWait, but that seems contradictory to the intuition that between two consecutive x-intercepts, the function crosses zero twice. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing something here. Let me think again. Let's take a specific example. Suppose n=1, then x=1/\u03c0 \u2248 0.318. For n=2, x=1/(2\u03c0) \u2248 0.159. So, between x=0.159 and x=0.318, the function sin(1/x) goes from 0 up to 1, back to 0, down to -1, and back to 0. So, in that interval, there are two x-intercepts: one when it goes from positive to negative, and another when it goes back. But wait, no, actually, each time n increases by 1, the function crosses zero once. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, no, let me graph the function mentally. As x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x decreases from 10,000 to 1000. So, as 1/x decreases from 10,000 to 1000, the sine function will oscillate between -1 and 1, crossing zero each time 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0. So, each time 1/x crosses n\u03c0, where n is an integer, the sine function crosses zero. So, the number of zeros is equal to the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10,000. Wait, no, because as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x decreases from 10,000 to 1000, so 1/x moves from 10,000 down to 1000, passing through each integer multiple of \u03c0 in that range.\n\nWait, so the number of zeros is equal to the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10,000. So, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10,000/\u03c0. As I calculated earlier, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098 and 10,000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that should be the number of zeros.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Each time n increases by 1, the function crosses zero once. So, if n goes from 319 to 3183, that's 3183 - 319 + 1 crossings. So, yes, 2865. But wait, does this account for both positive and negative crossings? Or is each crossing just a single point?\n\nWait, in reality, each time the argument 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0, the sine function crosses zero once. So, each n corresponds to exactly one zero crossing. So, the total number of zero crossings is indeed 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to see if this approach is correct. Suppose I take an interval (a, b) where a = 1/(3\u03c0) and b = 1/(\u03c0/2). Wait, no, that might not be the best example. Let me try a = 1/(2\u03c0) and b = 1/\u03c0. So, a = 1/(2\u03c0) \u2248 0.159 and b = 1/\u03c0 \u2248 0.318. So, in this interval, the function sin(1/x) will cross zero at x = 1/(\u03c0), 1/(2\u03c0), etc. Wait, but in this case, from x=1/(2\u03c0) to x=1/\u03c0, 1/x goes from 2\u03c0 to \u03c0. So, 1/x decreases from 2\u03c0 to \u03c0. So, sin(1/x) will go from sin(2\u03c0) = 0, then up to sin(3\u03c0/2) = -1, then back to sin(\u03c0) = 0. So, in this interval, there's only one zero crossing at x=1/\u03c0. Wait, but according to my earlier formula, n would be from 1 to 2, so n=1 and n=2. So, x=1/(1\u03c0) and x=1/(2\u03c0). But in the interval (1/(2\u03c0), 1/\u03c0), only x=1/\u03c0 is included, which is the endpoint. Hmm, so maybe I need to adjust for open intervals.\n\nWait, the original problem is in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001), so it doesn't include the endpoints. So, I need to ensure that the x-intercepts are strictly inside this interval. So, let's check whether x=1/(n\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001.\n\nSo, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, solving for n, as before, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10,000. So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098 and less than 10,000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. Now, let's check if x=1/(319\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Let's compute 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(319*3.14159) \u2248 1/1003.58 \u2248 0.0009964, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Similarly, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183*3.14159) \u2248 1/10,000.02 \u2248 0.0000999998, which is just below 0.0001, so it's not included in the interval. Wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, so x=1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0000999998, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, the maximum n such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n where 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which implies n < 10,000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, the maximum integer n is 3183, but 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999998 < 0.0001, so it's not included. So, the largest n for which 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3183, but wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so actually, the largest n such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182*3.14159) \u2248 1/10,000.000... something, which would be just over 0.0001.\n\nWait, let me compute 3182\u03c0: 3182 * 3.14159 \u2248 3182 * 3.14159. Let me compute 3000*3.14159=9424.77, 182*3.14159\u2248572.26, so total \u22489424.77 + 572.26 \u224810,000.03. So, 3182\u03c0\u224810,000.03, so 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.000099999, which is just below 0.0001. Wait, that's not right because 1/10,000 is 0.0001, so 1/(3182\u03c0) is approximately 0.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included in the interval. Hmm, so maybe I need to find the smallest n such that 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 and the largest n such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial approach. Let me re-examine the inequalities.\n\nWe have 0.0001 < x < 0.001, and x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nTaking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities):\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10,000\n\nSo, dividing by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10,000/\u03c0\n\nWhich is approximately:\n\n318.3098 < n < 3183.098\n\nSince n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. However, we need to check whether x=1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Let's compute 1/(3183\u03c0):\n\n3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 Let's compute 3000\u03c0\u22489424.77796, 183\u03c0\u2248575.19989, so total \u22489424.77796 + 575.19989 \u224810,000. So, 3183\u03c0\u224810,000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, but exactly, since 3183\u03c0\u224810,000.000... something, 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001 exactly. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, x=0.0001 is not included. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but it's actually slightly less because 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10,000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001, hence not included in the interval.\n\nTherefore, the maximum n for which 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3182. Let me check 1/(3182\u03c0):\n\n3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.14159265 \u2248 Let's compute 3000\u03c0\u22489424.77796, 182\u03c0\u2248572.263, so total \u22489424.77796 + 572.263\u224810,000.04096. So, 3182\u03c0\u224810,000.04096, so 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.0000999996, which is just under 0.0001, so it's not included. Hmm, so maybe n=3181?\n\nWait, let me compute 3181\u03c0: 3181 * \u03c0 \u2248 3181 * 3.14159265 \u2248 3000\u03c0\u22489424.77796, 181\u03c0\u2248568.147, so total\u22489424.77796 + 568.147\u224810,000. So, 3181\u03c0\u224810,000, so 1/(3181\u03c0)=0.0001 exactly. But since the interval is open, x=0.0001 is excluded, so 1/(3181\u03c0)=0.0001 is not included. Therefore, the largest n such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3180.\n\nWait, let me compute 3180\u03c0: 3180 * \u03c0\u22483180*3.14159265\u22483180*3=9540, 3180*0.14159265\u2248450. So, total\u22489540 + 450\u22489990. So, 3180\u03c0\u22489990, so 1/(3180\u03c0)\u22480.0001001, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n=3180 gives x\u22480.0001001, which is within the interval.\n\nSimilarly, n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22481/(1003.58)\u22480.0009964, which is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nSo, now, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3180. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3180 inclusive is 3180 - 319 + 1 = 2862. Wait, that's different from my earlier calculation of 2865. So, I must have made a mistake earlier by including n=3183, which actually gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is excluded. So, the correct maximum n is 3180, which gives x\u22480.0001001, which is included.\n\nWait, let me verify this. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3180. So, number of terms is 3180 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3180 - 319 = 2861, plus 1 is 2862. So, 2862 x-intercepts.\n\nBut wait, let me check n=3180: 3180\u03c0\u22489990, so 1/(3180\u03c0)\u22480.0001001, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. n=3181: 3181\u03c0\u224810,000, so 1/(3181\u03c0)=0.0001, which is excluded. So, n goes up to 3180.\n\nSimilarly, n=319: 319\u03c0\u22481003.58, so 1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009964, which is less than 0.001, so included. So, the number of x-intercepts is 3180 - 319 + 1 = 2862.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n went up to 3183, but that was incorrect because x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001 is excluded. So, the correct number is 2862.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me compute 3180 - 319 + 1: 3180 - 319 is 2861, plus 1 is 2862. So, that's the number of x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. The interval for 1/x is from 1000 to 10,000. The number of zeros of sin(\u03b8) in the interval \u03b8 \u2208 (1000, 10,000) is equal to the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 in that interval. So, the number of zeros is floor(10,000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248318.3098, so ceil(1000/\u03c0)=319.\n\n10,000/\u03c0\u22483183.098, so floor(10,000/\u03c0)=3183.\n\nSo, the number of zeros is 3183 - 319 + 1=2865.\n\nWait, but this contradicts my earlier conclusion of 2862. Hmm, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is whether the endpoints are included. Since the original interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), which corresponds to 1/x being in (1000, 10,000). So, \u03b8=1/x is in (1000, 10,000). So, the zeros occur at \u03b8=n\u03c0 where n is integer and 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10,000.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10,000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.3098 < n < 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1=2865.\n\nBut earlier, when I considered x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is not included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, perhaps in the \u03b8 domain, \u03b8=10,000 is excluded, so n must be less than 10,000/\u03c0\u22483183.098, so n=3183 is excluded. So, n goes up to 3182.\n\nSimilarly, \u03b8=1000 is excluded, so n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0\u2248318.3098, so n starts at 319.\n\nThus, the number of n's is 3182 - 319 +1=2864.\n\nWait, now I'm confused because different approaches are giving me different numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to compute the number of integers n where 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10,000.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10,000/\u03c0.\n\nSince n must be integer, n starts at ceil(1000/\u03c0)=319 and ends at floor(10,000/\u03c0)=3183.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1=2865.\n\nBut when considering x=1/(n\u03c0), we have to ensure that x is in (0.0001, 0.001), which is equivalent to 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10,000.\n\nSo, n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009964 < 0.001, so included.\n\nn=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is excluded because the interval is open. So, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive, so the number of integers is 3182 - 319 +1=2864.\n\nWait, but now I'm getting 2864, which is different from 2865.\n\nI think the confusion comes from whether n=3183 is included or not. Since x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001 is excluded, n=3183 is not included. So, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 3182 - 319 +1=2864.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm with an example. Suppose I have an open interval (a, b), and I want to find the number of integers n where c < n < d. The number of integers is floor(d-1) - ceil(c+1) +1. Wait, no, more accurately, the number of integers strictly between c and d is floor(d) - ceil(c). So, in this case, c=1000/\u03c0\u2248318.3098, d=10,000/\u03c0\u22483183.098.\n\nSo, the number of integers n where 318.3098 < n < 3183.098 is floor(3183.098) - ceil(318.3098)=3183 - 319=2864.\n\nSo, that's 2864 integers.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865 because I included n=3183, but since x=1/(3183\u03c0) is not included in the open interval, n=3183 should be excluded, so the correct number is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me compute floor(10,000/\u03c0)=3183, but since \u03b8=10,000 is excluded, n must be less than 3183.098, so n=3183 is excluded. So, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nSo, number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 +1=2864.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the \u03b8 domain, \u03b8=10,000 is excluded, so the maximum n is 3182, because 3182\u03c0\u22489990, which is less than 10,000, so 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.0001001, which is included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n=3182 is included.\n\nSimilarly, n=319 gives \u03b8=319\u03c0\u22481003.58, which is greater than 1000, so included.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 3182 - 319 +1=2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 3183 - 319 +1=2865, but since n=3183 is excluded, it's 2864.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with a smaller example. Suppose I have the interval (1/(3\u03c0), 1/\u03c0). So, 1/(3\u03c0)\u22480.106, 1/\u03c0\u22480.318. So, the x-intercepts in this interval would be at x=1/(2\u03c0)\u22480.159, which is inside (0.106, 0.318). So, how many x-intercepts? Only one at x=1/(2\u03c0). So, n=2. So, in this case, n starts at 2 and ends at 2, so number of intercepts is 1, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, if the interval is (1/(4\u03c0), 1/(2\u03c0)), then x-intercepts occur at x=1/(3\u03c0), which is inside. So, n=3, so number of intercepts is 1.\n\nWait, but in my problem, the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which corresponds to \u03b8=1/x in (1000, 10,000). The zeros occur at \u03b8=n\u03c0, n integer. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10,000. So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0\u2248318.3098 and less than 10,000/\u03c0\u22483183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. But in the open interval for x, we exclude x=0.0001 and x=0.001, so \u03b8=10,000 and \u03b8=1000 are excluded. So, n=3183 corresponds to \u03b8=3183\u03c0\u224810,000.000... something, which is just over 10,000, so excluded. Similarly, n=319 corresponds to \u03b8=319\u03c0\u22481003.58, which is just over 1000, so included.\n\nWait, but if \u03b8=10,000 is excluded, then n must be less than 10,000/\u03c0\u22483183.098, so n=3183 is excluded. So, n goes up to 3182.\n\nSo, the number of integers is from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 +1=2864.\n\nWait, but in the \u03b8 domain, \u03b8=10,000 is excluded, so n=3183 is excluded. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with another example. Suppose I have \u03b8 between 10 and 20, and I want to find the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 in that interval. So, \u03c0\u22483.14159, 2\u03c0\u22486.28318, 3\u03c0\u22489.42477, 4\u03c0\u224812.56636, etc. So, in \u03b8 \u2208 (10,20), the multiples of \u03c0 are 3\u03c0\u22489.42477 (excluded), 4\u03c0\u224812.56636, 5\u03c0\u224815.70796, 6\u03c0\u224818.84955, and 7\u03c0\u224821.9911 (excluded). So, the multiples of \u03c0 in (10,20) are 4\u03c0,5\u03c0,6\u03c0, which is 3 points. So, n=4,5,6, which is 3 integers. So, using the formula, floor(20/\u03c0)=6, ceil(10/\u03c0)=4, so 6 -4 +1=3, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, in my problem, \u03b8 \u2208 (1000,10,000). So, floor(10,000/\u03c0)=3183, ceil(1000/\u03c0)=319. So, number of n's is 3183 -319 +1=2865. But in this example, \u03b8=10,000 is excluded, so n=3183 is excluded, so the correct number is 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nWait, but in the example, when \u03b8=20 is excluded, n=7 is excluded, so the number of n's is floor(20/\u03c0)=6, which is correct. So, in the example, it's 6 -4 +1=3, which is correct. So, in my problem, it's floor(10,000/\u03c0)=3183, but since \u03b8=10,000 is excluded, n=3183 is excluded, so the number is 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nWait, but in the example, floor(20/\u03c0)=6, but n=7 is excluded because \u03b8=7\u03c0\u224821.99>20. So, the number of n's is 6 -4 +1=3, which is correct. So, in my problem, floor(10,000/\u03c0)=3183, but since \u03b8=10,000 is excluded, n=3183 is excluded, so the number of n's is 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but I'm now confused because earlier I thought it was 2865, but upon careful consideration, it's 2864. Let me check with another approach.\n\nThe number of zeros of sin(\u03b8) in \u03b8 \u2208 (a, b) is equal to the number of integers n such that a < n\u03c0 < b. So, the number of integers n is floor(b/\u03c0) - ceil(a/\u03c0). In this case, a=1000, b=10,000. So, floor(10,000/\u03c0)=3183, ceil(1000/\u03c0)=319. So, number of n's is 3183 -319=2864. So, that's the formula.\n\nWait, so the formula is floor(b/\u03c0) - ceil(a/\u03c0). So, 3183 -319=2864. So, that's the number of zeros.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I thought it was 2865, but now I'm"

    "text": " \n\nGiven that y = sin(1/x), setting this equal to zero gives sin(1/x) = 0. So, 1/x must be equal to n\u03c0. That means x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, each x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n. \n\nNow, the problem is asking for the number of such x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, I need to find all integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies between 0.0001 and 0.001. \n\nLet me write that as inequalities: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. I can solve these inequalities for n to find the range of integers n that satisfy this condition.\n\nStarting with the left inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that taking reciprocals reverses the inequality, I get 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Calculating 1/0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, I get n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me calculate that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1416, so 10000 divided by 3.1416 is approximately 3183.098. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.098.\n\nNow, the right inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 divided by 3.1416 is approximately 318.3098. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.3098.\n\nSince n has to be an integer, n must satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Let me check that. So, the smallest integer greater than 318.3098 is 319, and the largest integer less than 3183.098 is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nNow, to find how many integers are in this range, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add one (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2865.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, starting with 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n:\n\nLeft inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) => n\u03c0 < 10000 => n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n \u2264 3183.\n\nRight inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n\u03c0 > 1000 => n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098, so n \u2265 319.\n\nNumber of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct.\n\nHmm, but wait a second. When I take reciprocals, I have to make sure that the direction of the inequality is correct. Since 0.0001 and 0.001 are both positive, taking reciprocals will reverse the inequalities, which I did correctly. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) becomes n\u03c0 < 10000, and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 becomes n\u03c0 > 1000. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000. So, the argument of the sine function, which is 1/x, goes from 10000 down to 1000. Each time 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0, the sine function will cross zero. So, the number of zeros is the number of multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000.\n\nSo, the smallest multiple of \u03c0 greater than 1000 is \u03c0*319, and the largest multiple of \u03c0 less than 10000 is \u03c0*3183. So, the number of multiples is 3183 - 319 + 1, which is 2865. That makes sense.\n\nWait, let me check if 319\u03c0 is indeed greater than 1000. Calculating 319*3.1416: 300*3.1416=942.48, and 19*3.1416\u224859.69, so total is approximately 942.48 + 59.69 \u2248 1002.17, which is indeed greater than 1000. Similarly, 3183*\u03c0: 3183*3.1416 \u2248 let's see, 3000*3.1416=9424.8, 183*3.1416\u2248575.23, so total \u2248 9424.8 + 575.23 \u2248 9999.99, which is just under 10000, so that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of zeros is indeed 2865. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Solving 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 gives n between approximately 319 and 3183, yielding 2865 intercepts.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

So, solving for x, we get x = 1/(n\u03c0). That makes sense. So, every x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n.\n\nNow, I need to find how many such x's lie within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, let me write that down: 0.0001 < x < 0.001. But since x = 1/(n\u03c0), substituting that in, we get:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nI can rewrite this inequality to find the range of n. Let me take reciprocals on all parts, remembering that taking reciprocals reverses inequalities. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those reciprocals:\n\n1/0.001 = 1000, and 1/0.0001 = 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nNow, to solve for n, I can divide all parts by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nLet me calculate these values. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535. Let me compute that:\n\n1000 \u00f7 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184.\n\nSimilarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.09886184.\n\nSince n must be an integer, n can take integer values from the next integer after 318.309886184, which is 319, up to the integer just below 3183.09886184, which is 3183.\n\nSo, the number of integers n in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1. Wait, why +1? Because when counting inclusive integers from a to b, the count is b - a + 1. Let me check that with a small example: from 1 to 3, the numbers are 1,2,3, which is 3 numbers. 3 -1 +1 = 3, which is correct. So, yes, it's 3183 - 319 +1.\n\nCalculating that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in that interval.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I set sin(1/x) = 0, leading to 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). Then, I substituted x into the interval (0.0001, 0.001), resulting in 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals correctly changes the inequality to 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which seems right because as x gets smaller, n increases. Then, dividing by \u03c0 gives the bounds for n, which I approximated correctly.\n\nWait, but let me check the arithmetic when I subtract 319 from 3183. 3183 minus 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more gives 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct.\n\nHmm, but just to be thorough, let me consider whether the endpoints are included. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. So, when x approaches 0.0001 from the right, n approaches 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 3183.09886, so n must be less than that, so n = 3183 is included because x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001, right? Let me check: 1/(3183 * \u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/10000.000001, which is just over 0.0001, so yes, it's included. Similarly, for the lower bound, n = 319 gives x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.625) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive are valid, giving 2865 intercepts.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. When I take n starting at 319, does that mean x starts at 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so that's correct. And the upper n is 3183, which gives x \u2248 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000001, which is just over 0.0001, so that's correct because the interval is open at 0.0001, so x must be greater than 0.0001. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) is just over 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, the count is correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive. So, from 1 to 3183, there are 3183 integers, and from 1 to 318, there are 318 integers. So, subtracting, 3183 - 318 = 2865. So, that's correct. So, 2865 integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the subtraction: 3183 minus 318 is 2865? Let me compute 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 18 more, so 2883 - 18 = 2865. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check if 1/(319\u03c0) is indeed greater than 0.0001. Let me compute 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 1002.625. So, 1/1002.625 \u2248 0.00099736, which is 0.00099736, which is less than 0.001, so that's correct. Similarly, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 10000.000001, so 1/10000.000001 \u2248 0.000099999999, which is just over 0.0001, so that's correct as well.\n\nWait, but 1/10000 is exactly 0.0001, but since our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), open at both ends, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.000099999999, which is just less than 0.0001, but wait, that can't be right because 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 1/10000, which is 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10000.000001, then 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.000099999999, which is just under 0.0001. Wait, but that would mean that x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, which is outside our interval. So, that would imply that n=3183 gives x less than 0.0001, which is not in our interval. Therefore, n=3183 is excluded.\n\nWait, this is a problem. So, my earlier calculation was wrong because I thought 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10000.000001, which would make 1/(3183\u03c0) approximately 0.000099999999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 is excluded.\n\nSimilarly, n=3182 would give x=1/(3182\u03c0). Let me compute 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's see, 3180\u03c0 \u2248 3180 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3180 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, and 180\u03c0 \u2248 565.486677, so total is approximately 9424.77796 + 565.486677 \u2248 10,  let me check: 9424.77796 + 565.486677 \u2248 10, 9424.77796 + 565.486677 is 9989.264637. So, 3180\u03c0 \u2248 9989.264637. Then, 3182\u03c0 is 3180\u03c0 + 2\u03c0 \u2248 9989.264637 + 6.283185307 \u2248 9995.547822. So, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9995.547822, so 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9995.547822 \u2248 0.000100045, which is approximately 0.000100045, which is just over 0.0001, so x=1/(3182\u03c0) is approximately 0.000100045, which is greater than 0.0001, so it is included in the interval.\n\nWait, so n=3182 gives x\u22480.000100045, which is in (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=3183 gives x\u22480.000099999999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nSimilarly, let's check n=319. 319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477796, and 19\u03c0 \u2248 59.69026042, so total \u2248 942.477796 + 59.69026042 \u2248 1002.168056. So, 319\u03c0 \u2248 1002.168056, so 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.168056 \u2248 0.00099783, which is less than 0.001, so that's included. So, n=319 is valid.\n\nTherefore, the range of n is from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 gives 2864. So, that's 2864 intercepts.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier count. So, I must have made a mistake earlier by including n=3183, which gives x less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the correct count is from n=319 to n=3182, which gives 2864 intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this again. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which leads to n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886 and n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886 and less than approximately 3183.0988618. So, n can be 319, 320, ..., up to 3183, since 3183 is less than 3183.0988618. Wait, but earlier I thought that 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10000.000001, which would make x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099999999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded.\n\nWait, but 3183.0988618 is approximately 3183.0988618, so n=3183 is less than 3183.0988618, so n=3183 is allowed. Wait, but 3183\u03c0 is approximately 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute that accurately. Let's compute 3183 * 3.1415926535.\n\nCompute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 180\u03c0 \u2248 565.486677, 3\u03c0 \u2248 9.42477796. So, 3183\u03c0 = 3000\u03c0 + 180\u03c0 + 3\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796 + 565.486677 + 9.42477796 \u2248 9424.77796 + 565.486677 = 9989.264637 + 9.42477796 \u2248 9998.689415. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9998.689415, which is less than 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9998.689415 \u2248 0.000100013, which is approximately 0.000100013, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, so earlier I thought 3183\u03c0 was 10000.000001, but that's incorrect. It's actually approximately 9998.689415, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100013, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, n=3183 is valid, as x=1/(3183\u03c0) is just over 0.0001, so it's within the interval.\n\nSimilarly, let's check n=3184: 3184\u03c0 \u2248 3184 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2248 9998.689415 + 3.1415926535 \u2248 10001.83100765. So, 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/10001.83100765 \u2248 0.000099981, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, n=3183 is the highest n that satisfies x > 0.0001.\n\nSo, to recap: n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which gives n > 318.309886 and n < 3183.0988618. So, n can be integers from 319 up to 3183 inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 gives 2865. So, that's 2865 intercepts.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100013, which is included, so that's correct. So, n=3183 is included, making the count 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought 3183\u03c0 was 10000.000001, I thought that x=1/(3183\u03c0) would be less than 0.0001, but that was incorrect because 3183\u03c0 is actually less than 10000, so x is just over 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nSo, to confirm, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, so the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me just make absolutely sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let me compute 3183 - 319:\n\n3183 - 300 = 2883\n\n2883 - 19 = 2864\n\nThen, 2864 + 1 = 2865.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, from 1 to 3183, there are 3183 numbers, and from 1 to 318, there are 318 numbers. So, the numbers from 319 to 3183 inclusive would be 3183 - 318 = 2865. So, that's another way to see it.\n\nWait, yes, because 3183 - 318 = 2865. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the number of x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2865.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we determine where \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\). This occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for integer \\( n \\), leading to \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n\nSubstituting into the interval:\n\n\\[\n0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001\n\\]\n\nTaking reciprocals:\n\n\\[\n1000 < n\\pi < 10000\n\\]\n\nDividing by \\( \\pi \\approx 3.1415926535 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1000}{\\pi} \\approx 318.309886 < n < \\frac{10000}{\\pi} \\approx 3183.0988618\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( n \\) ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers in this range is:\n\n\\[\n3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\(\\boxed{2865}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nSo, if I set sin(1/x) equal to zero, that should give me 1/x = n\u03c0, right? Because sin(1/x) = 0 implies 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0. Therefore, solving for x, I get x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, every x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n.\n\nNow, I need to find all such x within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Let me write that down: 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), I can substitute this into the inequality to find the range of n that satisfies it. \n\nSo, substituting x, we have 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me solve this inequality for n. \n\nFirst, let me handle the left part of the inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that taking reciprocals reverses the inequality when both sides are positive, which they are here. So, 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Calculating 1/0.0001, that's 10,000. So, 10,000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, which is approximately 3.14159, we get n < 10,000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n \u2264 3183.\n\nNow, let's handle the right part of the inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n > 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.309. Since n must be an integer, n \u2265 319.\n\nSo, putting it all together, n must satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is given by b - a + 1. So, substituting the values, that would be 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865.\n\nWait, let me double-check that subtraction: 3183 minus 319. Hmm, 3183 minus 300 is 2883, and then minus 19 more is 2864. So, yes, 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. So, the original interval for x is (0.0001, 0.001). Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), and as n increases, x decreases, right? So, when n is smallest, x is largest, and when n is largest, x is smallest. So, the smallest n is 319, which gives x \u2248 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.87 \u2248 0.000997, which is just under 0.001. And the largest n is 3183, which gives x \u2248 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10000 \u2248 0.0001, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, we have to check if 1/(3183\u03c0) is indeed greater than 0.0001.\n\nWait, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 1/(3183*3.1416) \u2248 1/10000, which is 0.0001. But our interval is open at 0.0001, so x must be greater than 0.0001. So, does 1/(3183\u03c0) equal 0.0001 exactly? Let me check:\n\n1/(3183\u03c0) = 1/(3183 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000.00000000001) \u2248 0.0001 exactly. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at both ends, we need to exclude the endpoints. So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. Therefore, 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001.\n\nSo, for n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since it's equal to 0.0001, and our interval is open, x cannot be exactly 0.0001. So, n must be less than 3183. So, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nWait, that changes things. Let me recast the inequalities:\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, we have n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n \u2265 319.\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, we have n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n \u2264 3183.\n\nBut since the interval is open, x must be strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. Therefore, 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001.\n\nSo, for n, we have:\n\nn > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 \u21d2 n \u2265 319\n\nn < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098 \u21d2 n \u2264 3183\n\nBut since x must be greater than 0.0001, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n can be up to 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3183 - 1 = 3182, because n must be less than 3183.098, so the largest integer n is 3183, but wait, 3183 is less than 3183.098, so n can be 3183. But x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but is it exactly 0.0001? Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0):\n\n\u03c0 \u2248 3.1415926535\n\n3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute this:\n\n3183 * 3 = 9549\n\n3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, 3183 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 approximately 3183 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0928. Adding these up: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.0928 \u2248 450.7128. So total is 9549 + 450.7128 \u2248 10,000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000. Therefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 exactly.\n\nBut since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.0001, x cannot be 0.0001. Therefore, n cannot be 3183 because that would give x = 0.0001, which is excluded. So, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nSimilarly, for the lower bound, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. Let me check n=319: 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.87) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so that's fine.\n\nSimilarly, for n=3182: 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182*3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000 - a bit) \u2248 0.00010000... but slightly larger than 0.0001, so that's included in the interval.\n\nWait, but 3182\u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's see, 3182 * 3 = 9546, 3182 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 similar to before, but 3182 * 0.1 = 318.2, 3182 * 0.04 = 127.28, 3182 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 approx 3182 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0912. So total is 318.2 + 127.28 = 445.48 + 5.0912 \u2248 450.5712. So total 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9546 + 450.5712 \u2248 10, 9546 + 450.5712 is 9996.5712. So, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9996.5712, so 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.5712 \u2248 0.000100034, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Now, how many integers is that?\n\nThe number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that.\n\n3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 is 2864.\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 2865, but now I'm getting 2864. Let me check the subtraction:\n\n3182 - 319:\n\n3182 - 300 = 2882\n\n2882 - 19 = 2863\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the range. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3182. So, the number of terms is 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\nYes, because if you have numbers from 1 to m, the count is m. From a to b, it's b - a +1.\n\nSo, 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier when I included n=3183, I got 2865, but since n=3183 is excluded, it's 2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nBut let me think again: is there any possibility that n=3183 gives x=0.0001 exactly, which is excluded, so we don't include it. So, the maximum n is 3182, which gives x\u22480.000100034, which is just over 0.0001, so included.\n\nSimilarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.000997, which is just under 0.001, so included.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. The number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001). So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which is the same as 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nSo, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n > 318.309 \u21d2 n \u2265 319\n\n10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n < 3183.098 \u21d2 n \u2264 3183\n\nBut since x must be greater than 0.0001, which is 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded, so n must be \u2264 3182.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when I have n from 319 to 3182, inclusive, how many terms is that? Let me take a smaller example to verify. Suppose n ranges from 3 to 5 inclusive. Then the numbers are 3,4,5. That's 3 numbers. 5-3+1=3. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, from 1 to 3: 1,2,3: 3 numbers. 3-1+1=3. Correct.\n\nSo, applying that, 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial substitution. So, the function is y = sin(1/x). The zeros occur when 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nTaking reciprocals, we get 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nDividing by \u03c0, we get 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nWhich is approximately 318.309 < n < 3183.098.\n\nSo, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, n must be less than 3183.098, so n \u2264 3183, but as I saw earlier, n=3183 gives x=0.0001 exactly, which is excluded, so n \u2264 3182.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, the number of integers between a and b exclusive is floor(b) - ceil(a) +1? Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, in this case, a is 318.309, so ceil(a) is 319. b is 3183.098, so floor(b) is 3183. But since x must be less than 0.001, which is 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u21d2 n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n \u2265 319. Similarly, x must be greater than 0.0001 \u21d2 n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098 \u21d2 n \u2264 3183. But since x=1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded, so n \u2264 3182.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about the behavior of the function near the endpoints. As x approaches 0.0001 from the right, 1/x approaches 10,000, so sin(1/x) oscillates rapidly between -1 and 1. Similarly, as x approaches 0.001 from the left, 1/x approaches 1000, so sin(1/x) oscillates between -1 and 1. So, in between, it's oscillating between these two extremes, and each time 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0, we get a zero crossing.\n\nTherefore, the number of zeros is indeed the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001), which we found to be 2864.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integers n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n gives 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3182. The number of integers in this range is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}."

    "text": " \n\nSo, for y = sin(1/x) to be zero, 1/x must equal n\u03c0. That means x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, each x-intercept corresponds to x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n. Now, I need to find all such x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Let me write that down as an inequality: 0.0001 < x < 0.001.\n\nSince x = 1/(n\u03c0), I can substitute that into the inequality to find the range of n. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me solve for n in both parts of the inequality.\n\nFirst, let's solve 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that flipping the inequality when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive, I get n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating 1/0.0001 is the same as 10000, so n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618.\n\nNext, let's solve 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001. 1/0.001 is 1000, so n\u03c0 > 1000. Therefore, n > 1000 / \u03c0. Calculating that, 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618.\n\nSince n has to be an integer, let me figure out the smallest integer greater than 318.30988618, which is 319, and the largest integer less than 3183.0988618, which is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183.\n\nNow, to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1, but wait, no, let me think. If I have numbers from a to b inclusive, the count is b - a + 1. So here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that subtraction. 3183 minus 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more is 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nSo, that would mean there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But hold on, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities.\n\nSo, when x is in (0.0001, 0.001), that's the same as x being greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000, because 1/0.001 is 1000 and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1/x is in (1000, 10000). Therefore, sin(1/x) is zero when 1/x = n\u03c0, so n\u03c0 must be in (1000, 10000). So, n must be in (1000/\u03c0, 10000/\u03c0), which is approximately (318.30988618, 3183.0988618). Therefore, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again to be sure: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and 2864 + 1 is 2865. So, yes, 2865 intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me think about whether each n corresponds to exactly one x in the interval. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), and as n increases, x decreases. So, starting from n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1004.13) \u2248 0.000996, which is less than 0.001 and greater than 0.0001. Similarly, n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.00) \u2248 0.0001, but since it's open interval (0.0001, 0.001), does x=0.0001 count? Wait, no, because the interval is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001.\n\nWait, but when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000000318, which is just slightly above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, when n=319, x\u22480.000996, which is less than 0.001, so included. So, both endpoints are included in the interval, so n=319 and n=3183 are both valid.\n\nTherefore, the number of intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not missing something. Because when I have n from 319 to 3183, inclusive, that's 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the number of integers between 318.30988618 and 3183.0988618. The number of integers greater than 318.30988618 is the same as the number of integers from 319 upwards, and the number less than 3183.0988618 is up to 3183. So, the count is 3183 - 318 = 2865. Wait, no, that's not the right way to compute it.\n\nWait, another approach: the number of integers between a and b inclusive is floor(b) - ceil(a) +1. So, a is approximately 318.30988618, so ceil(a) is 319. b is approximately 3183.0988618, so floor(b) is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, that's consistent.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000996, which is less than 0.001, so it's inside the interval. When n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000000318, which is just above 0.0001, so it's inside the interval. So, both ends are included, so the count is correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did the subtraction correctly. 3183 minus 319: 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then minus 19 is 2864. Then, 2864 plus 1 is 2865. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the interval for n: n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of terms in this sequence is 3183 - 319 +1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more, which is 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865.\n\nSo, I think that's correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the initial setup. So, y = sin(1/x). The zeros occur where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). Now, x must lie in (0.0001, 0.001). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, inverting the inequalities, we get 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. Therefore, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check if 3183\u03c0 is exactly 10000, but no, because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 10000.000000318, which is just over 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is just under 0.0001, but wait, no, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000000318, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000996, which is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nWait, but let me compute 3183\u03c0: 3183 * \u03c0. Let me compute that more accurately. 3183 * 3.1415926535.\n\nFirst, 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796077\n183 * \u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 180\u03c0 \u2248 565.486677646 and 3\u03c0\u22489.42477796077, so total \u2248565.486677646 + 9.42477796077 \u2248574.911455607.\n\nSo, total 3183\u03c0 \u22489424.77796077 + 574.911455607 \u224810,000.000000377. So, 3183\u03c0 \u224810,000.000000377, which is just over 10,000. Therefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u22480.0001000000318, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nSimilarly, 319\u03c0: 300\u03c0\u2248942.477796077, 19\u03c0\u224859.690260418, so total\u2248942.477796077 +59.690260418\u22481002.168056495. So, 319\u03c0\u22481002.168056495, so 1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.00099784, which is less than 0.001, so included.\n\nTherefore, both n=319 and n=3183 correspond to x-values within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, the count from 319 to 3183 inclusive is correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about the function y = sin(1/x). As x approaches zero from the positive side, 1/x approaches positive infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. But in our case, x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a small interval near zero, but the function oscillates rapidly there. Each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the sine function completes a half-period, crossing zero. So, each integer multiple of \u03c0 in 1/x corresponds to a zero crossing.\n\nSo, the number of zeros is essentially the number of times 1/x can pass through n\u03c0 as x moves from 0.001 down to 0.0001. Since x is decreasing, 1/x is increasing, so n increases from 319 up to 3183. Each n gives a unique zero crossing. Therefore, the number of zeros is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. So, the final answer is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

Now, I need to find all such x that lie in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nLet me write that down: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. I can solve this inequality for n to find the range of integers n that satisfy it. \n\nFirst, let's take the reciprocal of all parts of the inequality. But remember, when taking reciprocals, the inequality signs reverse because all terms are positive. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. \n\nCalculating those reciprocals: 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, the inequality becomes 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. \n\nNow, I can divide all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values numerically. \n\nI know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. \n\nSo, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n can take integer values from 319 up to 3183. \n\nNow, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers, I can subtract the smaller number from the larger one and then add one (since both endpoints are included). \n\nSo, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. \n\nWait, let me double-check that subtraction. 3183 minus 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more to get 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct. \n\nSo, there are 2865 integer values of n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. I started with the function y = sin(1/x) and set it equal to zero, leading to x = 1/(n\u03c0). Then, I substituted the interval (0.0001, 0.001) into this equation, which gave me the inequality 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing by \u03c0, I found the range for n as approximately 318.31 to 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. \n\nTo find the count of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I subtract 319 from 3183, which gives 2864, and then add 1 to include both endpoints, resulting in 2865. \n\nIs there a possibility that I missed something? Let me think. The function sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely as x approaches 0, but in this case, our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is a finite interval. Each oscillation corresponds to a zero crossing at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, each integer n in that range corresponds to exactly one x-intercept in the interval. \n\nI don't think I made a mistake here. The key was correctly translating the interval for x into the corresponding interval for n, ensuring that n is an integer, and then counting the number of integers in that range. \n\nWait, another thought: since 1/x is a continuous function, and sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0, but in our case, x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a very small interval near zero. So, as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000. So, the argument of the sine function goes from 10000\u03c0 down to 1000\u03c0. \n\nEach time 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0, we get a zero crossing. So, the number of zero crossings is the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 between 1000\u03c0 and 10000\u03c0. Which is exactly what I calculated earlier, leading to n from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 intercepts. \n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer should be 2865.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we determine when \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\).

So, n\u03c0 < 10000, which means n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.098. Since n is an integer, n \u2264 3183.\n\nNow, the right inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309. Since n is an integer, n \u2265 319.\n\nSo, putting it all together, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to count how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, plugging in, that would be 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. \n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that subtraction to be sure. 3183 minus 300 is 2883, and then minus 19 more is 2864. Yep, that's correct. So, 2864 + 1 = 2865. \n\nSo, does that mean there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001)? Hmm, that seems like a lot, but considering the function y = sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times as x approaches 0, it makes sense that in such a small interval near zero, there are a large number of intercepts. \n\nLet me just verify my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\n1. The x-intercepts occur where sin(1/x) = 0, which is when 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0).\n\n2. We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\n3. Solving for n:\n\n   - For the lower bound: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n\u03c0 < 10000 \u21d2 n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098 \u21d2 n \u2264 3183.\n\n   - For the upper bound: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u21d2 n\u03c0 > 1000 \u21d2 n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 \u21d2 n \u2265 319.\n\n4. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\n5. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me check the calculation again: 3183 minus 319. 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more, which is 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865. Yep, that's correct.\n\nI think that's right. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so in this case, \u03b8 is 1/x, so sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0. That means x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer values of n. Now, I need to find all such x that lie in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nLet me write that down: I need to find all integers n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Hmm, let me solve for n. Let's rearrange the inequalities. \n\nStarting with 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, that implies n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Since 1/0.0001 is 10000, so n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n is an integer, the maximum integer n can be is 3183.\n\nNow, the other inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. That implies n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184. Since n is an integer, the smallest integer n can be is 319.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If n > 318.309886184, then the smallest integer n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range, inclusive. \n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n in this range, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, x = 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, solving for n, we have n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 and n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. \n\nTo find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, we can compute 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me do that step by step: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then adding 1 gives 2865. So, yes, that's correct. \n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that the number of integers between a and b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That seems right. \n\nLet me check with a smaller example to see if this formula works. Suppose I want to find the number of integers from 5 to 10 inclusive. The integers are 5,6,7,8,9,10, which is 6 numbers. Using the formula, 10 - 5 + 1 = 6. Yep, that works. So, applying the same logic here, 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. \n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there any possibility that some of these x-values might be outside the interval? For example, when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0). Let me compute that: 319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 1002. So, x \u2248 1/1002 \u2248 0.000998, which is approximately 0.001. Wait, 0.000998 is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. \n\nSimilarly, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0). Let me compute that: 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 10000. So, x\u22481/10000=0.0001. But the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.0001 and 0.001. So, does x=0.0001 and x=0.001 count? Since the interval is open, those endpoints are excluded. \n\nWait, so when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, x=0.0001 is not included. So, does that mean n=3183 is excluded? Similarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.000998, which is just below 0.001, so it's included because the interval is open at 0.001. Wait, no, open interval means it's not including the endpoints, but 0.000998 is less than 0.001, so it's included. \n\nWait, but n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001, which is exactly the lower bound, but since it's open, it's excluded. So, n=3183 is excluded, right? So, the maximum n is 3182. Let me recalculate that.\n\nWait, so earlier, I had n < 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.09886184, so n must be less than that, meaning the maximum integer n is 3183. But since x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001 is excluded because the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), we need to exclude n=3183. So, the maximum n is 3182. Similarly, let's check n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is excluded. So, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but since x=1/(3183\u03c0) is excluded, we have to take n up to 3182. \n\nWait, but 3183\u03c0\u224810000, so 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is the lower bound, but since the interval is open, we can't include it. So, the maximum n is 3182. Let me verify that. So, n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0). Let's compute 3182*\u03c0\u22483182*3.1415926535\u22483182*3=9546, 3182*0.1415926535\u22483182*0.1416\u2248450. So total\u22489546+450\u224810, so 3182\u03c0\u224810,000? Wait, no, 3183\u03c0\u224810,000, so 3182\u03c0\u224810,000 - \u03c0\u224810,000 - 3.1415926535\u22489996.85840735. So, x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22481/9996.85840735\u22480.0001000314, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nWait, but 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.0001000314, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Similarly, n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001, which is excluded. So, n can go up to 3182. \n\nSimilarly, for the lower bound, n=319 gives x\u22480.000998, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3182. \n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 +1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 gives 2864. So, there are 2864 x-intercepts. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, I need to correct that. Because when I included n=3183, which gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so we need to subtract 1 from the previous total. So, 2865 -1=2864. \n\nWait, let me confirm again. The initial calculation was n from 319 to 3183, which is 2865 numbers. But since n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, we have to exclude that, so the total is 2864. \n\nAlternatively, let me compute the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, 3182 - 319 +1. 3182 - 319 is 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, that's correct. \n\nWait, but let me check with n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.0001000314, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. And n=319: x\u22480.000998, which is just below 0.001, so it's included. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. \n\nWait, but let me think again. When n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is excluded, so n=3183 is excluded. So, the maximum n is 3182. So, the number of n's is from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864. \n\nSo, the correct number is 2864. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial calculation. So, 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.09886184, so n must be less than that, so n=3183 is excluded. So, the maximum n is 3182. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 +1=2864. \n\nYes, that seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the number of zeros is the number of times the sine function completes a full cycle as x approaches 0 from the right. But in this case, we're dealing with a specific interval, so it's better to stick with the initial approach. \n\nWait, but let me think about the function y=sin(1/x). As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a very small interval near zero, the function oscillates a huge number of times. Each oscillation corresponds to a zero crossing every \u03c0 interval in \u03b8=1/x. So, each zero crossing occurs at x=1/(n\u03c0), as we established. \n\nSo, the number of zero crossings in the interval (a, b) is the number of integers n such that a < 1/(n\u03c0) < b. Which is equivalent to 1/(b\u03c0) < n < 1/(a\u03c0). \n\nSo, in our case, a=0.0001, b=0.001. So, 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0). \n\nCalculating 1/(0.001\u03c0)=1000/\u03c0\u2248318.309886184. \n\n1/(0.0001\u03c0)=10000/\u03c0\u22483183.09886184. \n\nSo, n must be integers greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184. \n\nSo, the smallest integer n is 319, the largest is 3183. \n\nBut wait, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so n=3183 is allowed? Wait, no, because 3183.09886184 is greater than 3183, so n=3183 is allowed. But wait, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is the lower bound, which is excluded. So, n=3183 is excluded, so the maximum n is 3182. \n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 +1=2864. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, then n can only go up to 3182. So, the number of n's is 3182 - 319 +1=2864. \n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but after considering the exclusion of n=3183, it's 2864. \n\nLet me double-check with another approach. The number of zeros is equal to the number of integers n where 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001). So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. \n\nWait, that's another way to write it. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. \n\nWhich is the same as 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184. \n\nSo, n can be 319, 320, ..., 3183. \n\nBut since n must be less than 3183.09886184, the maximum integer n is 3183, but as we saw, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001 is excluded, so n=3183 is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. \n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 +1=2864. \n\nYes, that seems consistent. \n\nAlternatively, another way to compute it is to take the floor of 10000/\u03c0, which is 3183, and the ceiling of 1000/\u03c0, which is 319. Then, the number of integers is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceiling(1000/\u03c0) +1. Wait, but in this case, floor(10000/\u03c0)=3183, ceiling(1000/\u03c0)=319. So, 3183 - 319 +1=2865. But since n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, we have to subtract 1, giving 2864. \n\nSo, the formula would be floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceiling(1000/\u03c0) =3183 - 319=2864, but we have to check if n=3183 is included or not. Since x=1/(3183\u03c0) is excluded, we don't include it, so the total is 2864. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceiling(1000/\u03c0). So, 3183 - 319=2864. \n\nYes, that makes sense. \n\nSo, to summarize, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me compute 3182 - 319 +1. \n\n3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the number of integers between a and b is approximately (b - a)/1, but in this case, since it's a count of integers, it's exact. \n\nSo, I think I've double-checked it enough times. The number of x-intercepts is 2864. \n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me think about the endpoints again. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001). So, does x=0.0001 count? No, because it's open. Similarly, x=0.001 doesn't count. So, we're looking for x strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. \n\nSo, for x=1/(n\u03c0) to be in (0.0001, 0.001), we need 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. \n\nWhich implies n < 10000/\u03c0 and n > 1000/\u03c0. \n\nSo, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0\u2248318.309886184 and less than 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.09886184. \n\nSo, n can be 319, 320, ..., 3183. \n\nBut wait, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is excluded, so n=3183 is excluded. So, the maximum n is 3182. \n\nTherefore, the number of integers is from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 +1=2864. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nSo, I think I've thought it through thoroughly, and the answer is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. We need to find how many such x lie in (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nSolving for n:\n- 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886\n- 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u21d2 n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886\n\nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3182 (since n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded). The number of integers in this range is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}."

Calculating those reciprocals: 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nNow, to solve for n, I can divide all parts by \u03c0. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values. \n\nFirst, 1000 divided by \u03c0. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n can take integer values starting from the next integer after 318.309886184, which is 319, up to the integer just below 3183.09886184, which is 3183. \n\nNow, to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, actually, since we're starting at 319 and ending at 3183, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that.\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, that suggests there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nWait, hold on, let me double-check that. Sometimes when dealing with inclusive counts, it's easy to make a mistake. So, if I have a range from a to b inclusive, the number of integers is b - a + 1. So, in this case, a = 319, b = 3183. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, and 2864 + 1 = 2865. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm that each n from 319 to 3183 corresponds to a unique x-intercept in the interval. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), as n increases, x decreases. So, each n gives a distinct x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nBut let me check the endpoints to make sure. For n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.309) \u2248 0.0009977, which is just below 0.001, so it's within the interval. For n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.000) \u2248 0.0001, which is exactly the lower bound. But the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, meaning it doesn't include 0.0001 and 0.001. So, wait, does that mean x has to be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001? So, x = 1/(n\u03c0) must be strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001.\n\nTherefore, we need 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, solving for n:\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, we get n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, we get n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184.\n\nSo, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, n can be from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. \n\nBut wait, if n = 3183, then x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but since the interval is open at 0.0001, x must be greater than 0.0001. So, does n = 3183 give x just equal to 0.0001? Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0). \n\nCalculating 3183 * \u03c0: 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute that. 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, and 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 574.70062. So, adding them together, 9424.77796 + 574.70062 \u2248 10,000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10,000 = 0.0001. So, x = 0.0001 when n = 3183. But since our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, x must be greater than 0.0001. Therefore, n = 3183 gives x = 0.0001, which is not included in the interval. So, n must be less than 3183.09886184, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n should be 3182, because n = 3182 would give x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000 - \u03c0) \u2248 slightly more than 0.0001.\n\nWait, let me check that. If n = 3182, then x = 1/(3182\u03c0). Since 3182\u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 3182 * 3 = 9546, 3182 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3182 * 0.1415926535. Let me compute that:\n\n0.1 * 3182 = 318.2\n\n0.04 * 3182 = 127.28\n\n0.0015926535 * 3182 \u2248 approximately 5.06\n\nSo, adding up: 318.2 + 127.28 = 445.48 + 5.06 \u2248 450.54\n\nSo, total 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9546 + 450.54 \u2248 10,000 - approximately 10,000 - 10,000 is 10,000, so 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9999.46? Wait, that can't be right because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000. So, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 10,000 - \u03c0 \u2248 10,000 - 3.1415926535 \u2248 9996.85840735. Therefore, x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.85840735 \u2248 0.0001000314. So, that's just a bit above 0.0001, which is within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n = 3182 is acceptable. Similarly, n = 319 gives x \u2248 0.0009977, which is just below 0.001, so it's within the interval. \n\nSo, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3182. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, that's 2864 integers. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. Hmm, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, earlier I thought n goes up to 3183, but since n = 3183 gives x = 0.0001, which is excluded, n can only go up to 3182. So, the number of integers is from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with n = 319 and n = 3182. So, n = 319 is the first n where x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009977, which is less than 0.001. And n = 3182 gives x \u2248 0.0001000314, which is just above 0.0001. So, both endpoints are included within the interval, so n = 319 and n = 3182 are both valid. So, the count is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nBut wait, let me compute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863. Then, 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, 2864 integers. Therefore, there are 2864 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nBut let me double-check. Alternatively, I can compute the number of integers between two numbers a and b inclusive as floor(b) - ceil(a) + 1. So, in this case, a = 318.309886184, so ceil(a) = 319. And b = 3183.09886184, so floor(b) = 3183. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. But wait, that contradicts the earlier result.\n\nWait, but earlier I considered that n must be less than 3183.09886184, so the maximum n is 3183, but since x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded, so n should be up to 3182. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let's think differently. The number of integers n such that 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184. So, n must be greater than 318.309886184, so the smallest integer n is 319. And n must be less than 3183.09886184, so the largest integer n is 3183, but since x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded, so n can only go up to 3182. Therefore, the number of integers is from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nBut using the formula floor(b) - ceil(a) + 1, where a = 318.309886184, ceil(a) = 319, and b = 3183.09886184, floor(b) = 3183, so 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. But since n = 3183 gives x = 0.0001, which is excluded, we have to subtract 1, giving 2864.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula should be floor(b) - ceil(a) if the endpoints are excluded. Wait, let me check.\n\nThe number of integers strictly between a and b is floor(b) - ceil(a). So, if a < n < b, then the number of integers is floor(b - 1) - ceil(a) + 1? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the inequality 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, solving for n, we have 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184. So, n can be any integer from 319 up to 3183, but n = 3183 gives x = 0.0001, which is excluded. So, n goes up to 3182. Therefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of n starting at 1, the number of zeros of sin(1/x) in (0.0001, 0.001) corresponds to the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001). So, n must satisfy 1/(0.001) < n\u03c0 < 1/(0.0001), which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive, as n = 3183 gives x = 0.0001, which is excluded.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but let me compute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863, then add 1: 2864.\n\nYes, so the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure that each n corresponds to a unique x-intercept. Since sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0, and in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is close to zero, the function oscillates very rapidly. Each time 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0, the sine function crosses zero. So, each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept in that interval.\n\nTherefore, the total number of x-intercepts is equal to the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) lies in (0.0001, 0.001). As we determined, that's 2864 integers.\n\nWait, but let me check with n = 319 and n = 3182.\n\nFor n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.309886184) \u2248 0.0009977, which is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nFor n = 3182: x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(9996.85840735) \u2248 0.0001000314, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nSo, both endpoints are included in the interval, so n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865, but since n = 3183 is excluded, it's 2864.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the final answer is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001  \n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000  \n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0  \nApproximately 318.31 < n < 3183.098\n\nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. The number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\n$\\boxed{2864}$"

So, every x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n. Now, I need to find all such x that lie within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nLet me write that down: 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), substituting that in, I get 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. I need to find all integers n such that this inequality holds. \n\nLet me solve for n in each part of the inequality. Starting with the left side: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that flipping the inequality when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive. So, 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Calculating 1/0.0001, that's 10000. So, 10000 > n\u03c0, which means n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: 10000 divided by \u03c0. Since \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, 10000 divided by that is roughly 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n is an integer, the maximum possible n is 3183.\n\nNow, solving the right side of the inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, take reciprocals, flipping the inequality: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618. Since n is an integer, the smallest possible n is 319.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If n > 318.309..., then the smallest integer n is 319, right? Because 318 would give n\u03c0 \u2248 318 * 3.1416 \u2248 1000.0008, which is just over 1000. Hmm, actually, wait a second. Let me compute 318 * \u03c0: 318 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 1000.0008, which is indeed just over 1000. So, 318 * \u03c0 \u2248 1000.0008, which is greater than 1000. So, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009999992, which is just under 0.001. Wait, hold on, 1/(318\u03c0) is 1 divided by approximately 1000.0008, which is about 0.0009999992, which is less than 0.001. So, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009999992, which is just under 0.001. So, x = 1/(318\u03c0) is approximately 0.0009999992, which is just below 0.001, so it's within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but earlier I thought that n has to be greater than 318.309..., so n starts at 319. But here, n=318 gives x \u2248 0.0009999992, which is within the interval. So, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me clarify. The inequality is 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, so n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618, meaning the smallest integer n is 319. But wait, when n=318, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009999992, which is less than 0.001, so it's acceptable. So, does n=318 satisfy the inequality? Let me check: 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009999992 < 0.001, so yes, it does. So, why did I think n must be greater than 318.30988618? Because 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, so n must be greater than that, meaning n=319 is the first integer where n > 318.30988618. But wait, n=318 is less than 318.30988618? No, 318 is less than 318.30988618, so n=318 is less than 318.30988618, which would mean 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.001, which is not true because 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009999992 < 0.001. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to approach it differently. Let me solve the inequality 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies that n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than 318.30988618, meaning the smallest integer n is 319. But when n=318, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009999992, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, why does the inequality say n > 318.30988618? Because if n=318, it's less than 318.30988618, but 1/(318\u03c0) is still less than 0.001. Hmm, so perhaps the inequality is not strict in that direction. Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the exact inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than 318.30988618, meaning n=319 is the smallest integer n that satisfies this. But when n=318, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009999992 < 0.001, so it's still within the interval. So, perhaps the inequality is not strict in that direction. Maybe n can be equal to 318 as well. Wait, but n has to be an integer, so n=318 is less than 318.30988618, so it's not greater, it's less. So, does that mean n=318 doesn't satisfy n > 318.30988618? So, n must be strictly greater than 318.30988618, so n=319 is the first integer. But wait, when n=318, 1/(318\u03c0) is still less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I should instead consider that for x in (0.0001, 0.001), which is equivalent to 1/x in (1000, 10000). Because as x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity. So, x in (0.0001, 0.001) implies that 1/x is in (1000, 10000). So, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so 1/x must be in (1000, 10000). So, n\u03c0 must be in (1000, 10000). So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n must be in (1000/\u03c0, 10000/\u03c0), which is approximately (318.30988618, 3183.0988618). So, n must be an integer in that interval. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183. So, how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive? Let me calculate that. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that n is between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but let me make sure. So, x = 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me solve for n in both inequalities.\n\nFirst inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Multiply both sides by n\u03c0 (positive, so inequality remains same direction): 0.0001 * n\u03c0 < 1. Then, divide both sides by 0.0001: n\u03c0 < 1 / 0.0001 = 10000. So, n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than 3183.0988618, so the maximum integer n is 3183.\n\nSecond inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Multiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0. Then, divide both sides by 0.001: n\u03c0 > 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than 318.30988618, so the smallest integer n is 319.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me check with specific values to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Let's take n=319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1001.902) \u2248 0.0009981, which is just under 0.001, so it's within the interval. Now, n=3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0008) \u2248 0.0000999992, which is just over 0.0001, so it's within the interval. So, both endpoints are included.\n\nWait, but 0.0001 is 1e-4, and 0.001 is 1e-3. So, x must be greater than 1e-4 and less than 1e-3. So, 1e-4 < x < 1e-3. So, 1/x must be between 1000 and 10000, as I thought earlier. So, n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000. So, n must be between 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the count is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Let's compute 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 10000.0008. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999992, which is just under 0.0001. Wait, no, 0.0000999992 is 9.99992e-5, which is less than 0.0001 (which is 1e-4 or 0.0001). So, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999992 < 0.0001, which is outside the interval. So, that's a problem. So, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999992, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not in the interval. So, I must have made a mistake in my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, so I need to find n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies that n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than 3183.0988618, so the maximum integer n is 3183. But as we saw, when n=3183, x\u22480.0000999992 < 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. Let me check n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000 - \u03c0) \u2248 approximately 1/(10000 - 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/9996.8584 \u2248 0.0001000315, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. So, n=3182 gives x\u22480.0001000315, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nSimilarly, for the lower bound, n must be greater than 318.30988618, so the smallest integer n is 319, as before. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Now, let's compute the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, it's 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, there are 2864 integers n in that range.\n\nWait, but let me double-check with n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000315, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included. And n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009981, which is just under 0.001, so it's included. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but now it's 2864. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial calculation by including n=3183, which actually gives x just below 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the correct count is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another approach. Since 1/x must be in (1000, 10000), so n\u03c0 must be in (1000, 10000). So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. So, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be integers greater than 318.30988618 and less than 3183.0988618. So, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest integer n is 3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999992 < 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the largest n is 3182.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, 2864 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that n=3182 is indeed the last n that gives x > 0.0001. Let's compute 1/(3182\u03c0): 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 182\u03c0 \u2248 571.895, so total \u2248 9424.77796 + 571.895 \u2248 9996.67296. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.67296 \u2248 0.0001000315, which is indeed greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, n=3182 is included, and n=3183 is excluded. So, the count is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check n=3182 and n=3183 again. So, n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000315, which is just over 0.0001, so included. n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999992, which is just under 0.0001, so excluded. So, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but let me compute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863. Then, add 1: 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, 2864 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to make sure my method is correct. Suppose I want to find the number of x-intercepts in (0.01, 0.1). So, x in (0.01, 0.1) implies 1/x in (10, 100). So, n\u03c0 must be between 10 and 100. So, n must be between 10/\u03c0 \u2248 3.183 and 100/\u03c0 \u2248 31.83. So, n ranges from 4 to 31 inclusive. So, number of integers is 31 - 4 + 1 = 28. Let me compute x for n=4: x=1/(4\u03c0)\u22480.079577, which is less than 0.1, so included. For n=31: x=1/(31\u03c0)\u22480.010126, which is greater than 0.01, so included. So, 28 x-intercepts. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in our original problem, we have n from 319 to 3182, inclusive, which gives 2864 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when x approaches 0.0001 from the right, 1/x approaches 10000, so the corresponding n approaches 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, the largest integer n is 3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x\u22480.0000999992 < 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the largest n is 3182, which gives x\u22480.0001000315 > 0.0001, so included.\n\nSo, the count is from n=319 to n=3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but now it's 2864. So, I need to make sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the number of zeros by considering the interval for 1/x. So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000, as x ranges from 0.001 to 0.0001. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that n\u03c0 is in (1000, 10000). So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must be in (1000/\u03c0, 10000/\u03c0), which is approximately (318.30988618, 3183.0988618). So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x just below 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182, which is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the number of zeros by considering the length of the interval in terms of 1/x. The interval for x is (0.0001, 0.001), which corresponds to 1/x being in (1000, 10000). The length of this interval is 10000 - 1000 = 9000. Each zero occurs at intervals of \u03c0, so the number of zeros is approximately 9000 / \u03c0 \u2248 2866.197. But since we're dealing with integers, it's approximately 2866 zeros. But wait, that's close to 2864, which we calculated earlier. Hmm, but why the discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps because the interval is open, so we have to be careful about whether the endpoints are included or not. Let me think. The function y = sin(1/x) has zeros at x = 1/(n\u03c0), where n is a positive integer. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), we need to count all x = 1/(n\u03c0) such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which is 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. So, n is from 319 to 3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x\u22480.0000999992 < 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, n is from 319 to 3182, which is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but the approximation 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.197 suggests about 2866 zeros, but our exact count is 2864. So, perhaps the difference is due to the endpoints not being included and the exact positions of n=3182 and n=3183.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it as the floor of (10000/\u03c0) minus the ceiling of (1000/\u03c0). So, floor(10000/\u03c0) = floor(3183.0988618) = 3183. Ceiling(1000/\u03c0) = ceiling(318.30988618) = 319. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. But as we saw, n=3183 gives x\u22480.0000999992 < 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the correct count is 3183 - 319 + 1 - 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the formula would be floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceiling(1000/\u03c0) + 1, but since n=3183 is excluded, we subtract 1 more, giving 2864.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceiling(1000/\u03c0). So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm with another approach. The number of zeros of sin(1/x) in (a, b) is equal to the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (a, b). So, in this case, a=0.0001, b=0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) must be in (0.0001, 0.001). So, n must satisfy 1/(0.001) > n\u03c0 > 1/(0.0001). Wait, that would be n < 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618 and n > 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. Wait, that can't be right because 10000/\u03c0 is larger than 1000/\u03c0, so n would have to be both less than 318.30988618 and greater than 3183.0988618, which is impossible. So, I must have flipped the inequalities.\n\nWait, no, let me correct that. If 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001), then 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, taking reciprocals (and remembering to reverse the inequalities because we're dealing with positive numbers):\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nTherefore, n must be in (1000/\u03c0, 10000/\u03c0) \u2248 (318.30988618, 3183.0988618).\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x\u22480.0000999992 < 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182, which is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) has x-intercepts where \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\), which occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for integer \\( n \\). Thus, \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we determine the range of \\( n \\) such that \\( 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\).\n\n1. **Lower Bound**: \\( \\frac{1}{n\\pi} > 0.0001 \\) implies \\( n < \\frac{1}{0.0001\\pi} \\approx 3183.09886 \\).\n2. **Upper Bound**: \\( \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\) implies \\( n > \\frac{1}{0.001\\pi} \\approx 318.309886 \\).\n\nThus, \\( n \\) ranges from 319 to 3182. The number of integers in this range is \\( 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864 \\).\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}."

    "text": " \n\nBut in this case, \u03b8 is 1/x, so I can set up the equation 1/x = n\u03c0. Solving for x, that would mean x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, each x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n. Now, I need to find all such x that lie within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nLet me write that down: 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), I can substitute that into the inequality to find the range of n. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. \n\nTo solve for n, I can take the reciprocal of all parts of the inequality, but I have to remember that taking reciprocals reverses the inequalities. So, if I take reciprocals, the inequality becomes 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Let me compute those reciprocals: 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. \n\nNow, I can divide all parts of this inequality by \u03c0 to solve for n. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute those values. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. \n\nCalculating 1000/\u03c0: 1000 divided by 3.1415926535. Let me approximate that. 3.1415926535 times 318 is approximately 1000 because 3.1415926535 * 300 = 942.477, and 3.1415926535 * 18 = about 56.548, so 942.477 + 56.548 \u2248 999.025. So, 318 gives us around 999.025, which is just a bit less than 1000. So, 1000/\u03c0 is approximately 318.309886184. \n\nSimilarly, 10000/\u03c0 would be 10 times that, so 3183.09886184. \n\nSo, n must be an integer greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n can take on integer values starting from 319 up to 3183, because 3183 is less than 3183.09886184, and the next integer, 3184, would be too big because 3184\u03c0 is just over 10000. \n\nNow, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, 3183 - 318 = 2865, and then 2865 + 1 = 2866. \n\nWait, let me check that calculation again. If n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then +1 gives 2865. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think about it. \n\nThe formula for the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, it's 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. Each n corresponds to a unique x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, each integer n in the range 319 to 3183 will give an x in (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nLet me verify with n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0). Let's compute that. 319\u03c0 is approximately 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 1002. So, 1/1002 \u2248 0.000998, which is between 0.0001 and 0.001. \n\nSimilarly, for n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0). 3183\u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000, so 1/10000 = 0.0001, but since it's 3183\u03c0 which is a bit more than 10000, x will be a bit less than 0.0001, but wait, the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001. Hmm, so perhaps I need to check whether x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is actually greater than 0.0001. \n\nWait, 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000, 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001. But the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001. Therefore, n=3183 would give x=1/(3183\u03c0) which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the maximum n we can have is such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. \n\nSo, solving 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which is equivalent to n < 1/(0.0001 * \u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be less than that, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but since 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, we have to exclude it. So, the maximum n is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) would be greater than 0.0001. \n\nWait, let me check that. Let me compute 1/(3182\u03c0). So, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute 3182 * 3.1415926535. Well, 3182 * 3 = 9546, and 3182 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3182 * 0.1416 \u2248 3182 * 0.1 = 318.2, 3182 * 0.04 = 127.28, 3182 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0912. Adding those together: 318.2 + 127.28 = 445.48 + 5.0912 \u2248 450.5712. So, total is approximately 9546 + 450.5712 \u2248 9996.5712. So, 1/(9996.5712) \u2248 0.000100034, which is just over 0.0001. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100034, which is indeed greater than 0.0001. \n\nTherefore, n can go up to 3182, because n=3183 would give x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099966, which is less than 0.0001 and hence not in the interval. \n\nSo, now, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3182. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 + 1 = 2864. \n\nWait, that's different from my earlier calculation. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier when I included n=3183. So, let me correct that. \n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. The number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 gives 2864. So, there are 2864 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Sometimes when counting inclusive ranges, it's easy to miscount. Let me think of a smaller example. Suppose I have numbers from 2 to 5 inclusive. The count is 5 - 2 + 1 = 4, which is correct: 2,3,4,5. So, applying that to our case, from 319 to 3182 inclusive, the count is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. \n\nBut let me double-check by considering the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence. The formula is ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. Here, the common difference is 1, so it's (3182 - 319)/1 + 1 = 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, that seems correct. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought n went up to 3183, but then realized that n=3183 gives x less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, the maximum n is 3182. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. \n\nBut wait, let me check the lower bound as well. For n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0). Let me compute 319\u03c0: 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 1002. So, 1/1002 \u2248 0.000998, which is less than 0.001 and greater than 0.0001, so it's included. \n\nSimilarly, for n=3182, x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100034, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included. \n\nWait, but what about n=3183? 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099966, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, n goes up to 3182. \n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but upon re-evaluating, it's 2864. So, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial calculation. \n\nWait, let me confirm the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive. \n\nCompute 3182 - 319 = 2863. Then, add 1 to include both endpoints: 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, think of it as starting at 1, the number of integers from 1 to 3182 is 3182, and from 1 to 318 is 318, so the number from 319 to 3182 is 3182 - 318 = 2864. \n\nYes, that makes sense. \n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial setup. The function is y = sin(1/x). The zeros occur at 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). We're looking for x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. \n\nTaking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities): 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Then, dividing by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. \n\nAs computed earlier, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. \n\nSo, n must be an integer strictly greater than 318.309886184 and strictly less than 3183.09886184. So, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest integer n is 3183, but wait, 3183 is greater than 3183.09886184? No, 3183 is less than 3183.09886184. \n\nWait, 3183.09886184 is approximately 3183.09886, so 3183 is less than that. Therefore, n can be 3183 because 3183 < 3183.09886. Wait, but earlier I thought that 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, but let me check that again. \n\nCompute 3183\u03c0: 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute that more accurately. 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.1415926535. Let me compute 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, 3183 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0928. So, adding those together: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.0928 \u2248 450.7128. So, total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9549 + 450.7128 \u2248 9999.7128. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.7128 \u2248 0.0001000028. \n\nWait, that's approximately 0.0001000028, which is just over 0.0001. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000028, which is greater than 0.0001. Therefore, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is just over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nWait, but earlier I thought 3183\u03c0 was approximately 10000, but it's actually 9999.7128, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001000028, which is just over 0.0001. Therefore, n=3183 is acceptable because x=1/(3183\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nTherefore, the maximum n is 3183, and the minimum n is 319. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 gives 2865. \n\nWait, so now I'm confused because earlier I thought n=3183 was excluded, but upon more precise calculation, it's included. So, perhaps I was wrong before when I thought n=3183 was excluded. \n\nLet me double-check the calculation for 3183\u03c0. Using a calculator, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute this accurately. \n\n3183 * 3 = 9549. \n\n3183 * 0.1415926535: Let's compute 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, 3183 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 5.0928. \n\nAdding those: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.0928 \u2248 450.7128. \n\nSo, total is 9549 + 450.7128 \u2248 9999.7128. \n\nSo, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.7128, which is just under 10000. Therefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.7128 \u2248 0.0001000028, which is just over 0.0001. So, x = 0.0001000028 is indeed greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nTherefore, n can be 3183, so the maximum n is 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. \n\nWait, so that's the correct count? Let me confirm with a smaller example. Suppose I have n from 2 to 5 inclusive. The count is 5 - 2 + 1 = 4, which is correct: 2,3,4,5. So, applying that here, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. \n\nBut earlier I thought that n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000028, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, the correct count is 2865. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought n=3183 was excluded, but now it's included. So, perhaps my initial mistake was in the approximation. I thought 3183\u03c0 was 10000, but it's actually just under 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is just over 0.0001, hence included. \n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. \n\nWait, but let me check n=3184. 3184\u03c0 would be 3184 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3184 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's compute 3184 * 3 = 9552, 3184 * 0.1416 \u2248 3184 * 0.1 = 318.4, 3184 * 0.04 = 127.36, 3184 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0944. Adding those: 318.4 + 127.36 = 445.76 + 5.0944 \u2248 450.8544. So, total 9552 + 450.8544 \u2248 9999 + 0.8544 \u2248 9999.8544. Wait, that can't be right because 3184 is larger than 3183, so 3184\u03c0 should be larger than 3183\u03c0, which was 9999.7128. So, 3184\u03c0 \u2248 9999.8544, which is still less than 10000. Therefore, 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000032, which is still greater than 0.0001. So, x=1/(3184\u03c0) is still in the interval. \n\nWait, but 3184\u03c0 is approximately 9999.8544, which is still less than 10000, so 1/(3184\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001000032, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included. \n\nWait, but then n can go up to 3183, but 3184 is also included. Wait, no, because 3184\u03c0 is 3184 * \u03c0, which is more than 3183\u03c0, but still less than 10000? Wait, no, 3184\u03c0 is 3184 * \u03c0 \u2248 3184 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let me compute it more accurately. \n\nWait, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.7128, so 3184\u03c0 \u2248 9999.7128 + \u03c0 \u2248 9999.7128 + 3.1415926535 \u2248 10002.8544. Wait, that can't be right because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.7128, so adding \u03c0 (\u22483.1415926535) gives 3184\u03c0 \u2248 9999.7128 + 3.1415926535 \u2248 10002.8544. \n\nWait, that would mean 3184\u03c0 \u2248 10002.8544, which is greater than 10000. So, 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/10002.8544 \u2248 0.0000999715, which is less than 0.0001. Therefore, x=1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999715, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. \n\nWait, so that's different from my earlier calculation. So, I think I made a mistake in the earlier step. Let me correct that. \n\nSo, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.7128, which is just under 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000028, which is just over 0.0001, so included. \n\nThen, 3184\u03c0 \u2248 3183\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2248 9999.7128 + 3.1415926535 \u2248 10002.8544, which is over 10000, so 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999715, which is less than 0.0001, so excluded. \n\nTherefore, the maximum n is 3183, as 3184 would give x less than 0.0001. \n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought that 3183\u03c0 was 9999.7128, which is under 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is over 0.0001, so included. Therefore, the count is 2865. \n\nBut let me confirm with a more precise calculation. Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0 accurately. \n\nUsing a calculator, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.141592653589793 \u2248 let's compute this step by step. \n\n3183 * 3 = 9549. \n\n3183 * 0.141592653589793 \u2248 \n\nFirst, 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3 \n\n3183 * 0.04 = 127.32 \n\n3183 * 0.001592653589793 \u2248 \n\nCompute 3183 * 0.001 = 3.183 \n\n3183 * 0.000592653589793 \u2248 \n\nFirst, 3183 * 0.0005 = 1.5915 \n\n3183 * 0.000092653589793 \u2248 approximately 0.3 \n\nSo, adding up: 3.183 + 1.5915 = 4.7745 + 0.3 \u2248 5.0745 \n\nSo, total for 0.001592653589793 is approximately 5.0745. \n\nAdding up the parts: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.0745 \u2248 450.6945. \n\nSo, total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9549 + 450.6945 \u2248 9999.6945. \n\nTherefore, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.6945, which is just under 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.6945 \u2248 0.000100003, which is just over 0.0001, so included. \n\nSimilarly, 3184\u03c0 \u2248 3183\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2248 9999.6945 + 3.1415926535 \u2248 10002.8361. \n\nSo, 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 1/10002.8361 \u2248 0.0000999716, which is less than 0.0001, so excluded. \n\nTherefore, the maximum n is 3183, and the minimum n is 319. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought that 3183\u03c0 was just under 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is just over 0.0001, so included. Therefore, n=3183 is valid, and n=3184 is excluded. \n\nTherefore, the count is 2865. \n\nBut earlier I thought it was 2864, but that was because I incorrectly thought that 3183\u03c0 was over 10000, which led me to exclude n=3183. But upon more accurate calculation, 3183\u03c0 is just under 10000, so n=3183 is included. Therefore, the correct count is 2865. \n\nWait, but let me check this once more with precise calculations. \n\nCompute 3183 * \u03c0: \n\n3183 * \u03c0 = 3183 * 3.141592653589793 \n\nLet me compute this using a calculator approach: \n\n3183 * 3 = 9549 \n\n3183 * 0.141592653589793 \n\nCompute 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3 \n\n3183 * 0.04 = 127.32 \n\n3183 * 0.001592653589793 \n\nCompute 3183 * 0.001 = 3.183 \n\n3183 * 0.000592653589793 \n\nCompute 3183 * 0.0005 = 1.5915 \n\n3183 * 0.000092653589793 \u2248 3183 * 0.00009 \u2248 0.28647 \n\nSo, adding up: 3.183 + 1.5915 = 4.7745 + 0.28647 \u2248 5.06097 \n\nSo, total for 0.001592653589793 is approximately 5.06097 \n\nAdding up all parts: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.06097 \u2248 450.68097 \n\nSo, total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9549 + 450.68097 \u2248 9999.68097 \n\nSo, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.68097, which is less than 10000. Therefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.68097 \u2248 0.0001000032, which is just over 0.0001, so included. \n\nTherefore, n=3183 is valid, and n=3184 would be 3184\u03c0 \u2248 3183\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2248 9999.68097 + 3.1415926535 \u2248 10002.82256, so 1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999715, which is less than 0.0001, so excluded. \n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought 3183\u03c0 was approximately 10000, but now it's clear that it's just under, so n=3183 is included. Therefore, the count is 2865. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial calculation where I thought n went up to 3182. So, perhaps I was confused earlier, but now it's clear that n=3183 is included, making the count 2865. \n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. \n\nWait, but let me think about this differently. The interval (0.0001, 0.001) is the same as (1/10000, 1/1000). So, x is between 1/10000 and 1/1000. \n\nThe zeros occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, for x in (1/10000, 1/1000), we have 1/10000 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 1/1000. \n\nTaking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities): 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. \n\nDividing by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. \n\nAs computed, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. \n\nSo, n must be an integer strictly greater than 318.309886184 and strictly less than 3183.09886184. \n\nTherefore, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest integer n is 3183, since 3183 < 3183.09886184. \n\nTherefore, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. \n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. \n\nI think that's"

So, each x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n. Now, I need to find all such x that lie within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nLet me write down the inequalities for x. Since x has to be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001, substituting x = 1/(n\u03c0) gives:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nI can rewrite these inequalities to solve for n. Let's start with the left inequality:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0).\n\nTaking reciprocals on both sides (and remembering that flipping inequalities when taking reciprocals because both sides are positive), we get:\n\n1/0.0001 > n\u03c0.\n\nCalculating 1/0.0001, that's 10000. So,\n\n10000 > n\u03c0.\n\nDividing both sides by \u03c0:\n\nn < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nSimilarly, for the right inequality:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nTaking reciprocals again:\n\nn\u03c0 > 1/0.001.\n\n1/0.001 is 1000, so:\n\nn\u03c0 > 1000.\n\nDividing both sides by \u03c0:\n\nn > 1000/\u03c0.\n\nSo now, n must satisfy:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nSince n must be an integer, I need to find the number of integers between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0.\n\nLet me calculate these values numerically. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535.\n\nFirst, 1000/\u03c0:\n\n1000 divided by 3.1415926535 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184.\n\nSimilarly, 10000/\u03c0:\n\n10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184.\n\nSince n has to be an integer, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183.\n\nNow, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1. Wait, no, actually, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183.\n\nSo, number of integers = 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 3183 minus 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more, which gives 2864. Then add 1, so 2865. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as starting from n=1 up to n=3183, which is 3183 numbers, and then subtract the numbers from n=1 to n=318, which is 318 numbers. So, 3183 - 318 = 2865. Yeah, that checks out.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the initial setup. So, x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is between 1e-4 and 1e-3. So, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, the zeros of sin(1/x) occur at 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0), so n must be such that 1/(n\u03c0) is between 1e-4 and 1e-3.\n\nSo, solving for n, n must be between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0, as I did before, which gives n from 319 to 3183, which is 2865 integers. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me just double-check the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Alternatively, if I list n from 1 to 3183, that's 3183 numbers. From 1 to 318, that's 318 numbers. So, 3183 - 318 = 2865. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

Now, I need to find all such x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nLet me write that down: I need to find all integers n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Hmm, so I can solve this inequality for n. Let me rearrange it. \n\nFirst, let's take the reciprocal of all parts, but remember that taking reciprocals reverses the inequalities because all terms are positive. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those, 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. \n\nNow, to solve for n, I can divide all parts by \u03c0. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute those values. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535. Let me calculate that. \n\n1000 divided by 3.1415926535 is approximately 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is 10000 / 3.1415926535, which is approximately 3183.09886184. \n\nSo, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319, and the largest possible n is 3183. \n\nNow, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, no, actually, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that. \n\n3183 minus 319 is... let's see, 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more, which gives 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. \n\nTherefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 1000 / \u03c0 is approximately 318.309886184, so the next integer is 319. Similarly, 10000 / \u03c0 is approximately 3183.09886184, so the integer part is 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. \n\nLet me compute 3183 - 319 again. 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then minus 19 is 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. Yep, that seems correct. \n\nSo, each integer n between 319 and 3183 corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. \n\nI think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the final answer should be 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so n ranges from 319 to 3183. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

Now, I need to find all such x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Let me write that down:\n\n0.0001 < x < 0.001\n\nSince x = 1/(n\u03c0), I can substitute that into the inequality:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nNow, I need to solve for n here. Let me rearrange the inequalities to find the range of n.\n\nFirst, let's take the left inequality:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0)\n\nMultiplying both sides by n\u03c0 (assuming n is positive, which it will be since x is positive in our interval):\n\n0.0001 * n\u03c0 < 1\n\nDivide both sides by 0.0001:\n\nn\u03c0 < 1 / 0.0001\nn\u03c0 < 10000\n\nSo, n < 10000 / \u03c0\n\nCalculating that, \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n can be at most 3183.\n\nNow, let's take the right inequality:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nAgain, multiply both sides by n\u03c0:\n\n1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by 0.001:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0\n\nSo, n > 1000 / \u03c0\n\nCalculating that, 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184.

The number of integers from a to b inclusive is given by b - a + 1. So, substituting the values:\n\nNumber of intercepts = 3183 - 319 + 1\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\nThen, 2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because 2865 intercepts in such a small interval seems extremely high. Maybe I made a mistake in my inequalities.\n\nWait, let me check the substitution again. The original interval is (0.0001, 0.001). So, x is between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. Because 1/0.001 = 1000 and 1/0.0001 = 10000.\n\nSo, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000 \u2264 n\u03c0 \u2264 10000.\n\nDividing all parts by \u03c0:\n\n1000 / \u03c0 \u2264 n \u2264 10000 / \u03c0\n\nWhich is approximately:\n\n318.309886184 \u2264 n \u2264 3183.09886184\n\nSince n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\n2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nSo, 2865 intercepts. Hmm, that's correct mathematically, but it's a huge number of intercepts in such a small interval, which makes sense because as x approaches 0, 1/x becomes very large, and the sine function oscillates rapidly. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is between 1/10000 and 1/1000, the function sin(1/x) completes about 10000/(2\u03c0) oscillations, which is roughly 1591 oscillations. Each oscillation has two intercepts, so approximately 3182 intercepts, but since we're starting from n=319, which is the first n where n\u03c0 \u2265 1000, the number of intercepts is 2865. Wait, that seems conflicting.\n\nWait, actually, each period of the sine function corresponds to an increase of \u03c0 in the argument, so the number of zeros (intercepts) between 1/x = a and 1/x = b would be approximately (b - a)/\u03c0, because each \u03c0 interval adds one zero. So, in our case, 1/x goes from 1000 to 10000, so the number of zeros would be roughly (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 = 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.198, which is close to our earlier count of 2865. So, that makes sense.\n\nSo, perhaps 2865 is the correct number. But let me think again: when n starts at 319, the first x-intercept is at x = 1/(319\u03c0), which is approximately 1/(1002.3), which is about 0.0009977, which is just below 0.001. Wait, no, 1/(319\u03c0) is about 0.0009977, which is just below 0.001, but our interval is up to 0.001. So, does 1/(319\u03c0) lie within (0.0001, 0.001)?\n\nWait, 0.0001 is 1e-4, 0.001 is 1e-3. So, 1/(319\u03c0) is approximately 0.0009977, which is less than 0.001, so it is within the interval. Similarly, the last intercept is at x = 1/(3183\u03c0), which is approximately 1/(10000.0), which is 0.0001, but our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so does x = 1/(3183\u03c0) lie within the interval?\n\nWait, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but the interval is open at 0.0001, so x must be greater than 0.0001. So, we need to check whether 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001.\n\nWait, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10000 \u2248 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but just slightly less than 0.0001 because 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000. Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0:\n\n3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 183\u03c0 \u2248 574.70137, so total is approximately 9424.77796 + 574.70137 \u2248 9999.47933. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.47933, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.47933 \u2248 0.0001000052. Wait, that's just over 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000052, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n=3183 is included.\n\nSimilarly, n=319: 319\u03c0 \u2248 1002.3, so 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009977, which is less than 0.001, so included.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, so the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that each period adds two intercepts, so the number of intercepts would be approximately twice the number of periods. But in this case, we're just counting each n, which corresponds to each zero crossing. Wait, actually, for each n, we have one intercept, so the number of intercepts is equal to the number of n's in that range. So, if n goes from 319 to 3183, that's 2865 intercepts.\n\nBut let me think about the function sin(1/x). As x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000. So, the argument of the sine function is decreasing from 10000 to 1000. So, the sine function will oscillate between -1 and 1, crossing zero each time the argument passes through a multiple of \u03c0. So, each time n increases by 1, we get another zero crossing.\n\nBut wait, actually, as 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000, the sine function will go through zero crossings at each n\u03c0, but n is decreasing? Wait, no, because 1/x is decreasing, so the argument is decreasing, so the sine function is moving backward through its cycle. So, each time 1/x passes through n\u03c0, we get a zero crossing. So, the number of zero crossings is the number of integers n such that 1000 \u2264 n\u03c0 \u2264 10000, which is exactly what we calculated.\n\nSo, yes, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nBut let me just confirm with a small example. Suppose I take a smaller interval, say (0.1, 0.2). Then 1/x is between 5 and 10. So, n\u03c0 must be between 5 and 10. So, n must be from ceil(5/\u03c0) \u2248 2 to floor(10/\u03c0) \u2248 3. So, n=2 and n=3, so two intercepts. Let's compute 1/(2\u03c0) \u2248 0.159, and 1/(3\u03c0) \u2248 0.106. So, both 0.106 and 0.159 are in (0.1, 0.2). So, two intercepts, which matches our calculation. So, the formula seems to work.\n\nSimilarly, if I take (0.00001, 0.0001), which is 1e-5 to 1e-4, then 1/x is between 10000 and 100000. So, n must satisfy 10000 \u2264 n\u03c0 \u2264 100000. So, n starts at ceil(10000/\u03c0) \u2248 3183 and ends at floor(100000/\u03c0) \u2248 31830.988, so n=3183 to 31830. The number of intercepts would be 31830 - 3183 + 1 = 28648. So, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, applying the same logic, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when x approaches 0, the function sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times, but in our case, we're looking at x between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a finite interval, so the number of oscillations is finite, hence the number of intercepts is finite.\n\nSo, yes, I think 2865 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we determine when \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\).

    "text": " \n\nGiven that, for sin(1/x) to be zero, 1/x must be equal to n\u03c0. So, 1/x = n\u03c0, which implies that x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, each x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n. Now, I need to find all such x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nLet me write down the interval in terms of inequalities: 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), I can substitute that into the inequality to find the range of n. \n\nSo, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. To find n, I can take reciprocals on all parts of the inequality, but I have to remember that taking reciprocals reverses the inequalities. So, let's do that step by step. \n\nFirst, let's find the lower bound: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Taking reciprocals, we get 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Calculating 1/0.0001, that's 10,000. So, 10,000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, we get n < 10,000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10,000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 10,000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.098.\n\nNow, the upper bound: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals again, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n\u03c0 > 1000, meaning n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that, 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.3098. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.3098.\n\nSince n has to be an integer, let's figure out the integer values of n that satisfy both inequalities. So, n must be greater than 318.3098 and less than 3183.098. That means n starts from the next integer after 318.3098, which is 319, and goes up to the integer just below 3183.098, which is 3183.\n\nNow, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can use the formula for the number of integers between two numbers: it's the upper bound minus the lower bound plus one. So, that would be 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865.\n\nWait, hold on a second. Let me double-check that subtraction: 3183 - 319. Let me break it down. 3183 - 300 is 2883, and then subtracting 19 more gives 2864. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nBut wait, does n start at 319 and go up to 3183? Let me confirm the initial bounds. The lower bound was n > 318.3098, so n must be at least 319. The upper bound was n < 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183. So, yes, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But let me think again: is there any chance I made a mistake in the bounds? Let me check the calculations again.\n\nFirst, lower bound: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, n\u03c0 < 10,000, so n < 10,000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n can be up to 3183.\n\nUpper bound: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, so n\u03c0 > 1000, so n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098. So, n starts at 319.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183. The number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, let me think about whether each n in this range corresponds to a unique x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, each n gives a distinct x = 1/(n\u03c0). Since n is an integer, each x is unique, and since n increases, x decreases. So, as n increases from 319 to 3183, x decreases from 1/(319\u03c0) to 1/(3183\u03c0). Let me compute 1/(319\u03c0) and 1/(3183\u03c0) to see if they lie within the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nCalculating 1/(319\u03c0): 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 319 * 3 = 957, 319 * 0.1416 \u2248 45.1344, so total \u2248 1002.1344. So, 1/1002.1344 \u2248 0.0009978, which is approximately 0.0009978, which is less than 0.001 but greater than 0.0001. So, 0.0009978 is in (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nNow, 1/(3183\u03c0): 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's compute that. 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.777, and 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 574.825, so total \u2248 9424.777 + 574.825 \u2248 9999.602. So, 1/9999.602 \u2248 0.000100004, which is just slightly above 0.0001, so it's within the interval.\n\nTherefore, each n from 319 to 3183 gives an x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is there any possible overlap or missed intercepts? For example, could there be a case where two different n's give the same x? I don't think so because x = 1/(n\u03c0) is a strictly decreasing function of n, so each n gives a unique x. Therefore, each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept in the interval.\n\nSo, yes, I think my calculation is correct. The number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\). This occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for some integer \\( n \\), which implies \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n\nWe need \\( x \\) to be within the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\). This translates to the inequality:\n\\[ 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\]\n\nTaking reciprocals and solving for \\( n \\):\n1. For the lower bound:\n   \\[ \\frac{1}{0.0001} > n\\pi \\implies 10000 > n\\pi \\implies n < \\frac{10000}{\\pi} \\approx 3183.098 \\]\n2. For the upper bound:\n   \\[ \\frac{1}{0.001} < n\\pi \\implies 1000 < n\\pi \\implies n > \\frac{1000}{\\pi} \\approx 318.3098 \\]\n\nThus, \\( n \\) must be an integer such that \\( 319 \\leq n \\leq 3183 \\). The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is calculated as:\n\\[ 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts is \\(\\boxed{2865}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nWait, so in this case, \u03b8 is 1/x. So, sin(1/x) = 0 implies that 1/x = n\u03c0, right? Which means x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, each x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n. Now, I need to find all such x that lie in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nLet me write that down: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, I can solve for n in this inequality to find all integers n that satisfy this condition. \n\nFirst, let's invert the inequalities. Since all terms are positive, the direction of the inequalities won't change. So, inverting 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) gives 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0, which is 10000 > n\u03c0. Similarly, inverting 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 gives n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is n\u03c0 > 1000. \n\nSo now, I have two inequalities: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. To find n, I can divide all parts by \u03c0. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values. \n\nI know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 1000 / 3.1415926535. Let me calculate that: 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 / \u03c0 is 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. \n\nSo, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319, and the largest possible n is 3183. \n\nNow, to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n in that range. \n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 1000/\u03c0 is approximately 318.309886184, so the next integer n is 319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 is approximately 3183.09886184, so the largest integer n is 3183. \n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, that seems correct. \n\nWait, but let me think about whether all these x-values 1/(n\u03c0) lie within (0.0001, 0.001). So, when n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(319 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(1002.74) \u2248 0.00099726, which is approximately 0.000997, which is indeed greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. \n\nSimilarly, when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000.000000000001) \u2248 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10000.000000000001, which is just over 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is just under 0.0001. Wait, that's a problem because our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. \n\nWait, so if n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since it's exactly 0.0001 when n is 3183.09886184, which is not an integer, so the integer n=3183 would give x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so does x = 1/(3183\u03c0) lie inside the interval? \n\nWait, let me compute 3183 * \u03c0 more accurately. Let me compute 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let's see, 3000 * \u03c0 is about 9424.77796, 183 * \u03c0 is approximately 183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 183 * 3 = 549, 183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 25.93, so total \u2248 549 + 25.93 \u2248 574.93. So, 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.778, plus 183\u03c0 \u2248 574.93, so total \u2248 9424.778 + 574.93 \u2248 10,000. Hmm, that's exactly 10,000. So, 3183\u03c0 is exactly 10,000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) = 1/10000 = 0.0001. But our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, x = 0.0001 is not included, so n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is not in the interval. So, the maximum n we can have is n=3182, which would give x=1/(3182\u03c0). Let's compute that. \n\n3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 3000\u03c0 as before, which is 9424.77796, then 182\u03c0 \u2248 182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 182 * 3 = 546, 182 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 25.76, so total \u2248 546 + 25.76 \u2248 571.76. So, 3000\u03c0 + 182\u03c0 \u2248 9424.778 + 571.76 \u2248 9996.538. So, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9996.538, so 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.538 \u2248 approximately 0.000100034, which is just over 0.0001, so it is included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nWait, but if 3183\u03c0 is exactly 10000, then 3182\u03c0 is just under 10000, so 1/(3182\u03c0) is just over 0.0001. So, that would be included in the interval. So, n can go up to 3182. Let me check that again. \n\nWait, so when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001, which is excluded, so the maximum n is 3182. Similarly, the minimum n is 319 because when n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0). Let me compute that: 318\u03c0 \u2248 318 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 1000. So, 318\u03c0 \u2248 1000, so x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.001, which is the upper bound of the interval. But since the interval is open, x must be less than 0.001, so n=318 gives x\u22480.001, which is excluded. So, the smallest n is 319, which gives x\u22480.000997, which is just under 0.001, so it's included. \n\nWait, let me compute 318\u03c0 more accurately. 318 * \u03c0 \u2248 318 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477796, and 18\u03c0 \u2248 56.5486677. So, 318\u03c0 \u2248 942.477796 + 56.5486677 \u2248 999.0264637. So, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/999.0264637 \u2248 0.001000974, which is just over 0.001, so it's excluded. So, n=318 gives x\u22480.001000974, which is outside the interval, so the smallest n is 319, which gives x\u22481/(319\u03c0). \n\nCalculating 319\u03c0: 300\u03c0 \u2248942.477796, 19\u03c0\u224859.69026042. So, 319\u03c0\u2248942.477796 + 59.69026042\u22481002.168056. So, 1/(319\u03c0)\u22481/1002.168056\u22480.00099782, which is less than 0.001, so included. \n\nSo, now, the range of n is from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Let me compute the number of integers in this range. So, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3182 - 319 + 1 = 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. Wait, that's different from my earlier calculation. Wait, earlier I had 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865, but now I'm considering n up to 3182, so it's 3182 -319 +1=2864. \n\nWait, let me make sure. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3182. So, how many terms is that? Let me think of it as the number of integers from 1 to 3182 minus the number of integers from 1 to 318. So, 3182 - 318 = 2864. So, that's correct. So, there are 2864 integers n between 319 and 3182 inclusive. \n\nWait, but let me confirm with another approach. Let's compute 3182 - 319 = 2863, and then add 1 to include both endpoints, so 2863 +1=2864. So, that seems correct. \n\nWait, but earlier, when I thought n went up to 3183, I had 2865, but now that I'm correcting for the open interval, it's 2864. So, that's the correct number. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let's take a small example. Suppose I have numbers from 3 to 5 inclusive. So, 3,4,5. How many numbers? 5 -3 +1=3. So, that's correct. Similarly, from 3 to 6 inclusive: 6-3+1=4 numbers: 3,4,5,6. \n\nSo, applying that formula here, from 319 to 3182 inclusive: 3182 -319 +1=2864. So, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. \n\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything else. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches zero, right? So, between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a very small interval near zero, the function oscillates very rapidly. Each oscillation corresponds to a peak and a trough, and between each peak and trough, there's an x-intercept. \n\nWait, but in this case, each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, we get another zero crossing. So, the number of zero crossings should correspond to how many multiples of \u03c0 fit into the interval of 1/x between 1000 and 10000. So, as x goes from 0.001 to 0.0001, 1/x goes from 1000 to 10000. So, the number of zero crossings is the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. \n\nWait, so that would be the number of integers n where 1000 \u2264 n\u03c0 \u2264 10000, which is equivalent to 1000/\u03c0 \u2264 n \u2264 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.309886184 \u2264 n \u2264 3183.09886184. So, n can be 319 up to 3183, but as we saw earlier, n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so n goes up to 3182. \n\nSo, the number of n's is 3182 - 319 +1=2864. So, that's correct. \n\nWait, but let me think about the function's behavior. Since sin(1/x) oscillates between -1 and 1, crossing zero each time 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0. So, each zero crossing corresponds to a solution of 1/x = n\u03c0, which is x=1/(n\u03c0). So, each n gives a unique x-intercept in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) provided that x=1/(n\u03c0) lies within that interval. \n\nSo, the number of such n's is the number of integers between 319 and 3182 inclusive, which is 2864. \n\nWait, but let me think about whether each x=1/(n\u03c0) is unique and lies within the interval. Since n is an integer, each x is unique, and as we saw, when n=319, x\u22480.000997, which is within (0.0001, 0.001), and when n=3182, x\u22480.000100034, which is just over 0.0001, so included. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought 3182\u03c0 is 9996.538, so 1/(3182\u03c0)=1/9996.538\u22480.000100034, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. So, that's correct. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. \n\nWait, but let me check once more. Let's compute the exact values of 319\u03c0 and 3182\u03c0 to ensure that x=1/(319\u03c0) and x=1/(3182\u03c0) lie within the interval. \n\n319\u03c0: 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 1002.168056. So, 1/1002.168056 \u2248 0.00099782, which is less than 0.001, so included. \n\n3182\u03c0: 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 3000\u03c0\u22489424.77796, 182\u03c0\u2248571.76, so total\u22489424.77796 + 571.76\u22489996.53796. So, 1/9996.53796\u22480.000100034, which is greater than 0.0001, so included. \n\nSo, both endpoints are included in the interval, so n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive, giving 2864 integers. \n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. \n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3182 - 319 +1. 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, that's correct. \n\nWait, but let me think again: when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.000997, which is within (0.0001, 0.001). When n=3182, x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.000100034, which is just over 0.0001, so included. So, each n from 319 to 3182 gives a unique x in the interval, so 2864 x-intercepts. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. Thus, n ranges from 319 to 3182, giving 2864 x-intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2864}$"

    "text": " \n\nSo, for y = sin(1/x) to be zero, 1/x must equal n\u03c0. That means x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer values of n. Now, I need to find all such x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nFirst, let me write down the interval in terms of inequalities. So, 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), I can substitute that into the inequality. That gives me 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. \n\nLet me solve for n in this inequality. Let's take the reciprocals on all sides, remembering that reversing the inequalities when taking reciprocals because all terms are positive. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those, 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. \n\nNow, to solve for n, I'll divide all parts by \u03c0. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values numerically. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.31. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is 10000 / 3.1416 \u2248 3183.098. \n\nSince n has to be an integer, n must be greater than 318.31 and less than 3183.098. So, n can take integer values starting from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. \n\nTo find the number of integers between two numbers, I can subtract the smaller number from the larger one and add 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that. 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives me 2865. \n\nWait, let me double-check that subtraction. 3183 minus 300 is 2883, and then minus 19 more is 2864. So, yes, 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. \n\nBut hold on a second, I should confirm whether both endpoints are included. Since n must be greater than 318.31, the smallest integer n is 319, and n must be less than 3183.098, so the largest integer n is 3183. So, yes, both 319 and 3183 are included, so the count is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. \n\nSo, does that mean there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001)? Let me think again. Each integer n gives a unique x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). Since n ranges from 319 to 3183, each of these corresponds to a unique x in the interval. \n\nWait, let me check if x = 1/(n\u03c0) for n = 319 is greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. Let's compute 1/(319\u03c0). So, 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 1003. So, 1/1003 \u2248 0.000997, which is approximately 0.000997, which is indeed between 0.0001 and 0.001. Similarly, for n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0). 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000. So, 1/10000 = 0.0001, but since n is less than 3183.098, the actual x is slightly more than 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since 3183 is the largest integer less than 3183.098, x is just above 0.0001, so it's within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nWait, but hold on, when n increases, x decreases, right? So, as n increases from 319 to 3183, x decreases from approximately 0.000997 to approximately 0.0001. So, each n corresponds to a unique x in the interval. Therefore, each integer n from 319 to 3183 gives exactly one x-intercept in (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nSo, the total number of x-intercepts is the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, which is 2865. \n\nWait, let me just confirm the calculation again. 3183 minus 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, that seems correct. \n\nBut just to make sure, let me test with smaller numbers. Suppose I have n from 1 to 3. Then, the number of integers is 3 - 1 + 1 = 3, which is correct: 1, 2, 3. Similarly, if n is from 2 to 4, it's 4 - 2 + 1 = 3: 2,3,4. So, that formula works. \n\nTherefore, I think I can confidently say that the number of x-intercepts is 2865. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\). This occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for some integer \\( n \\), which implies \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n\nWe need \\( x \\) to be in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\). Therefore, we solve the inequality:\n\\[ 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\]\n\nTaking reciprocals, we get:\n\\[ 1000 < n\\pi < 10000 \\]\n\nDividing by \\( \\pi \\) (approximately 3.1415926535), we find:\n\\[ \\frac{1000}{\\pi} \\approx 318.31 < n < \\frac{10000}{\\pi} \\approx 3183.098 \\]\n\nThus, \\( n \\) must be an integer between 319 and 3183 inclusive. The number of integers in this range is calculated as:\n\\[ 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts is \\(\\boxed{2865}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nSo, if I set 1/x equal to n\u03c0, then I can find the x-values where the function is zero. That would mean x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for each integer n. Now, I need to find how many such x-values lie within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nLet me write down the inequalities that define this interval. So, 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x is 1/(n\u03c0), I can substitute that in: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Now, I can solve these inequalities for n. \n\nFirst, let's handle the left part of the inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, I need to remember that taking reciprocals reverses the inequality. So, 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Calculating 1/0.0001, that's 10000. So, 10000 > n\u03c0, which means n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is roughly 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n is an integer, the maximum n can be is 3183.\n\nNow, let's look at the right part of the inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, we get n\u03c0 > 1/0.001, which is 1000. So, n > 1000 / \u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618. Since n is an integer, the smallest n can be is 319.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that. If n > 318.30988618, then n starts at 319, right? Because 318 would give n\u03c0 \u2248 318 * 3.1416 \u2248 1000.032, which is just over 1000, so 1/(n\u03c0) would be just under 0.001. So, 318 would actually be included because 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/1000.032 \u2248 0.000999968, which is less than 0.001. Hmm, so maybe I need to check whether 318\u03c0 is greater than 1000 or not. Let me compute 318\u03c0: 318 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 318 * 3.1416 \u2248 1000.032. So, 318\u03c0 \u2248 1000.032, which is just over 1000. So, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999968, which is less than 0.001. So, 318\u03c0 is just over 1000, so 1/(318\u03c0) is just under 0.001. Therefore, 318 is included because x = 1/(318\u03c0) is just under 0.001, which is within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nSimilarly, let's check n = 318: x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999968 < 0.001, so it's included. What about n = 317? Let's compute 317\u03c0 \u2248 317 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 317 * 3.1416 \u2248 1000 - let me compute 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477, 17\u03c0 \u2248 53.407, so total \u2248 942.477 + 53.407 \u2248 995.884. So, 317\u03c0 \u2248 995.884, so 1/(317\u03c0) \u2248 1/995.884 \u2248 0.0010042, which is just over 0.001. So, x = 1/(317\u03c0) \u2248 0.0010042, which is greater than 0.001, so it's outside the interval. Therefore, n cannot be 317, but n can be 318. \n\nSimilarly, for the lower bound, n must be less than 3183.0988618, so the maximum integer n is 3183. Let me check n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1415926535). Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.1416 \u2248 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, 3183 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0928. Adding up: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.0928 \u2248 450.7128. So total \u2248 9549 + 450.7128 \u2248 9999.7128. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.7128, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.7128 \u2248 0.0001000028. Now, the lower bound is 0.0001, so 0.0001000028 is just over 0.0001, so x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is just over 0.0001, which is outside the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n = 3183 is excluded. \n\nWait, so if n = 3183 gives x \u2248 0.0001000028, which is just above 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. So, the maximum n is 3182. Let me check n = 3182: 3182\u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute 3180\u03c0 first: 3180 * \u03c0 \u2248 3180 * 3.1416 \u2248 3180 * 3 = 9540, 3180 * 0.1416 \u2248 3180 * 0.1 = 318, 3180 * 0.04 = 127.2, 3180 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.088. So, 318 + 127.2 = 164.2 + 5.088 \u2248 169.288. So, total \u2248 9540 + 169.288 \u2248 9709.288. Then, 3182\u03c0 is 3180\u03c0 + 2\u03c0 \u2248 9709.288 + 6.2832 \u2248 9715.5712. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9715.5712 \u2248 0.00010295. Hmm, that's still just over 0.0001, so x \u2248 0.00010295, which is just over 0.0001, so again outside the interval. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me try a different approach. Instead of computing each n, perhaps I can find the range of n such that x is between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nLet me solve for n in both inequalities:\n\nFirst inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001\n=> n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n=> n\u03c0 < 10000\n=> n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618\nSo, n \u2264 3183\n\nSecond inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n=> n\u03c0 > 1/0.001\n=> n\u03c0 > 1000\n=> n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618\nSo, n \u2265 319\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. Now, let's check whether n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000028, which is just over 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. So, n=3183 is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. Let me check n=3182: 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010295, which is still just over 0.0001, so it's outside. Hmm, this suggests that perhaps even n=3182 is excluded. Maybe I need to find the smallest n such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001.\n\nWait, perhaps I can solve for n in the inequality 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001.\n\nSo, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001\n=> n\u03c0 < 10000\n=> n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618\nSo, n can be up to 3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x just over 0.0001, which is outside. So, the maximum n is 3182, but let's check if 1/(3182\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Let me compute 3182\u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to find the exact values where 1/(n\u03c0) is just above and below 0.0001.\n\nSo, 1/(n\u03c0) = 0.0001\n=> n = 1/(0.0001 * \u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618\n\nSo, n must be less than this value, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x \u2248 0.0001000028, which is just above 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. Therefore, the maximum n that gives x within (0.0001, 0.001) is n=3182, but wait, let's check n=3182:\n\n1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/9999.7128 \u2248 0.0001000028, which is still just over 0.0001. So, that's outside. So, perhaps the maximum n is 3181? Let's compute 3181\u03c0 \u2248 3181 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3181 * 3.1416 \u2248 Let me compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.777, 181\u03c0 \u2248 568.252, so total \u2248 9424.777 + 568.252 \u2248 9993.029. So, 3181\u03c0 \u2248 9993.029, so 1/(3181\u03c0) \u2248 1/9993.029 \u2248 0.00010007, which is still just over 0.0001. Hmm, so maybe n=3180?\n\n3180\u03c0 \u2248 3180 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3180 * 3.1416 \u2248 3180 * 3 = 9540, 3180 * 0.1416 \u2248 3180 * 0.1 = 318, 3180 * 0.04 = 127.2, 3180 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.088. So, 318 + 127.2 = 164.2 + 5.088 \u2248 169.288. So, total \u2248 9540 + 169.288 \u2248 9709.288. Therefore, 1/(3180\u03c0) \u2248 1/9709.288 \u2248 0.00010300, which is still just over 0.0001. \n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me instead compute the smallest n such that 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 and the largest n such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. \n\nWait, no, the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, for x = 1/(n\u03c0), we have 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nSo, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) implies n\u03c0 < 10000, so n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618.\n\nSimilarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n\u03c0 > 1000, so n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618.\n\nSo, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. But wait, when n=3183, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000028, which is just over 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. So, the maximum n is 3182, but as we saw, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010295, which is still just over 0.0001. So, perhaps the maximum n is 3181, but 1/(3181\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010007, which is still over. Wait, maybe I need to find the exact n where 1/(n\u03c0) is just under 0.0001. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the floor and ceiling functions. Let me try that.\n\nThe smallest n such that 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 is n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, so the smallest integer n is 319.\n\nThe largest n such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618, so the largest integer n is 3183. However, as we saw, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000028 > 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. Therefore, the largest n such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is 3183, but since 1/(3183\u03c0) is just over 0.0001, it's outside. So, the largest n that gives x within the interval is 3182, but as we saw, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010295, which is still over 0.0001. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001, so n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n can be up to 3183, but 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.7128, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000028, which is just over 0.0001, so it's outside. Therefore, the largest n that gives x within the interval is 3182, but let's check 3182\u03c0: 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let me compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.777, 182\u03c0 \u2248 571.735, so total \u2248 9424.777 + 571.735 \u2248 9996.512. So, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9996.512, so 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.512 \u2248 0.000100035, which is still just over 0.0001. So, perhaps n=3181: 3181\u03c0 \u2248 3181 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.777, 181\u03c0 \u2248 568.252, so total \u2248 9424.777 + 568.252 \u2248 9993.029. So, 1/(3181\u03c0) \u2248 1/9993.029 \u2248 0.00010007, which is still over 0.0001.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me instead compute the exact n where 1/(n\u03c0) = 0.0001. Solving for n, n = 1/(0.0001 * \u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988618. So, the integer n must be less than 3183.0988618, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but as we saw, 1/(3183\u03c0) is just over 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n that gives x within (0.0001, 0.001) is 3182, but 1/(3182\u03c0) is still over 0.0001. So, perhaps the maximum n is 3181? Let me compute 1/(3181\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010007, which is still over. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the number of integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. But wait, if n=3183 is excluded because x=1/(3183\u03c0) is just over 0.0001, then the maximum n is 3182, so the number of integers would be 3182 - 319 + 1 = 3182 - 319 = 2863 + 1 = 2864. But wait, let me check: 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 numbers. But if n=3183 is excluded, then it's 2864. But earlier, I saw that n=3183 gives x just over 0.0001, so it's outside the interval, so we should exclude it. So, total number of n's is 2864.\n\nBut wait, let me check with smaller numbers to see if this approach is correct. Suppose I have an interval (a, b), and I want to count the number of integers n such that a < 1/(n\u03c0) < b. So, n must satisfy 1/(b\u03c0) < n < 1/(a\u03c0). So, the number of integers n is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)).\n\nIn this case, a = 0.0001, so 1/(a\u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988618, so floor(1/(a\u03c0)) = 3183.\n\nb = 0.001, so 1/(b\u03c0) \u2248 318.30988618, so ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) = 319.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers n is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. But wait, since n must be less than 3183.0988618, the maximum n is 3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x just over 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the number of n's is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The formula is floor(upper) - ceil(lower) + 1. Here, upper is 1/(a\u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988618, so floor(upper) = 3183.\n\nLower is 1/(b\u03c0) \u2248 318.30988618, so ceil(lower) = 319.\n\nSo, number of integers n is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nBut since n=3183 gives x just over 0.0001, which is outside, we have to subtract 1, making it 2864.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula accounts for that. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me use the formula correctly.\n\nThe number of integers n satisfying m < n < M is floor(M - 1) - ceil(m) + 1.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to compute the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. But since n=3183 gives x just over 0.0001, it's excluded, so the actual number is 2865 - 1 = 2864.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check whether 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/9999.7128 \u2248 0.0001000028, which is just over 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, so the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, let me compute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, 2882 - 19 = 2863, then +1 = 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nBut let me check with n=319: 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(319 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/1003.1416 \u2248 0.00099686, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Similarly, n=3182: 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010295, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Wait, no, 0.00010295 is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but earlier I thought 1/(3182\u03c0) was just over 0.0001, but actually, 0.00010295 is just over 0.0001, so it's included. Wait, but the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so does that mean we exclude the endpoints? So, x must be strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001.\n\nWait, so if x = 0.00010295, that's greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Similarly, x = 0.00099686 is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, n=319 gives x\u22480.00099686, which is less than 0.001, so included. n=3182 gives x\u22480.00010295, which is greater than 0.0001, so included. Therefore, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive give x within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But wait, n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001000028, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included because 0.0001000028 > 0.0001. So, the number of n's is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n=3183 gives x just over 0.0001, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so x=0.0001000028 is acceptable. So, n=3183 is included. Therefore, the total number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with exact calculations. Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0):\n\n1/(3183 * \u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/9999.7128 \u2248 0.0001000028.\n\nSince 0.0001000028 > 0.0001, it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.00099686 < 0.001, so it's included. Therefore, all integers n from 319 to 3183 inclusive give x within the interval. So, the number of such n's is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n=3183 was excluded because x was just over 0.0001, but since the interval is open, as long as x is greater than 0.0001, it's included. So, 0.0001000028 is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, the total number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nBut let me double-check this with another approach. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. The number of oscillations increases as x decreases. The x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0), so the number of intercepts between x=a and x=b is the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is between a and b.\n\nSo, in our case, a = 0.0001, b = 0.001.\n\nSo, the number of n's is the number of integers n where 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nWhich translates to n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988618 and n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.30988618.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nThe number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that n=3183 gives x just over 0.0001, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so n=3183 is included. Therefore, the total number is 2865.\n\nBut let me check with a smaller example to see if this approach is correct. Suppose I have the interval (0.1, 0.2). How many x-intercepts are there?\n\nSo, x must satisfy 0.1 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.2.\n\nSo, 1/(0.2\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.1\u03c0)\n\n1/(0.2\u03c0) \u2248 1/0.6283 \u2248 1.5915, so n > 1.5915, so n \u2265 2.\n\n1/(0.1\u03c0) \u2248 1/0.3142 \u2248 3.1831, so n < 3.1831, so n \u2264 3.\n\nSo, n=2 and n=3.\n\nSo, x=1/(2\u03c0) \u2248 0.15915 < 0.2, included.\n\nx=1/(3\u03c0) \u2248 0.1061 < 0.2, included.\n\nSo, two x-intercepts. Using the formula: floor(1/(0.1\u03c0)) = floor(3.1831) = 3.\n\nceil(1/(0.2\u03c0)) = ceil(1.5915) = 2.\n\nNumber of integers = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, if the interval is (0.05, 0.1), then:\n\n1/(0.1\u03c0) \u2248 3.1831, so n > 3.1831, so n \u2265 4.\n\n1/(0.05\u03c0) \u2248 6.3662, so n < 6.3662, so n \u2264 6.\n\nSo, n=4,5,6.\n\nNumber of integers: 6 - 4 + 1 = 3.\n\nLet me check: x=1/(4\u03c0) \u2248 0.07957 < 0.1, included.\n\nx=1/(5\u03c0) \u2248 0.06366 < 0.1, included.\n\nx=1/(6\u03c0) \u2248 0.05305 < 0.1, included.\n\nSo, three x-intercepts, which matches.\n\nTherefore, the formula seems to work.\n\nSo, applying it to our problem:\n\nNumber of x-intercepts = floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) + 1\n\nWhere a = 0.0001, b = 0.001.\n\nSo, floor(1/(0.0001\u03c0)) = floor(3183.0988618) = 3183.\n\nceil(1/(0.001\u03c0)) = ceil(318.30988618) = 319.\n\nNumber of integers = 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that n=3183 gives x just over 0.0001, but in the smaller example, n=3 gives x=1/(3\u03c0) \u2248 0.1061, which is within (0.1, 0.2). So, perhaps in our problem, n=3183 gives x=0.0001000028, which is just over 0.0001, so it's included because the interval is open. Therefore, the total number is 2865.\n\nWait, but in the smaller example, when a=0.1, b=0.2, n=2 gives x=0.15"

So, the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) where n is a positive integer because x is in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is between 0.0001 and 0.001, both positive numbers.\n\nNow, I need to find all the integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies within (0.0001, 0.001). So, let me write that inequality:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nI can rewrite this inequality to find the range of n. Let's take reciprocals, remembering that taking reciprocals reverses the inequalities because all terms are positive.\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nCalculating those reciprocals:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nNow, divide all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nLet me compute these values numerically. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535.\n\nSo, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184\n\nSimilarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSince n has to be an integer, n must be greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184. So, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest integer n can be is 3183.\n\nNow, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1. Wait, no, actually, it's (3183 - 319) + 1. Let me compute that.\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\n2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nWait, that can't be right because 319 + 2865 = 3184, which is one more than 3183. So, I think I made a mistake there. Let me correct that.\n\nActually, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183.\n\nSo, number of integers = 3183 - 319 + 1 = ?\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\n2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nWait, that's the same result as before. But let me check: if a = 319 and b = 319, then the number of integers is 1, which is 319 - 319 + 1 = 1. So that formula works. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nBut let me verify this with a smaller example. Suppose a = 3 and b = 5. Then, the integers are 3,4,5: three numbers. 5 - 3 + 1 = 3. So yes, that works. So, 2865 is correct.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure that 1/(n\u03c0) is indeed within (0.0001, 0.001) for n from 319 to 3183. Let's check n=319:\n\nx = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(319 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(1002.314) \u2248 0.0009976, which is approximately 0.0009976, which is greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, that's good.\n\nNow, n=3183:\n\nx = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10001.13) \u2248 0.000099989, which is approximately 0.000099989, which is less than 0.0001. Wait, that's a problem because 0.000099989 is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, that would mean that n=3183 gives x \u2248 0.000099989, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not in the interval. So, our upper bound n is actually 3182, because 3182\u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 10000 - a bit.\n\nWait, let me compute 3182 * \u03c0:\n\n3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535\n\nWell, 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796077\n\n182\u03c0 \u2248 182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 571.373\n\nSo, total is approximately 9424.77796077 + 571.373 \u2248 9996.15\n\nSo, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9996.15, so x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.15 \u2248 0.0001000385, which is just above 0.0001. So, that's within the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but when n=3183, we get x\u22480.000099989, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nSimilarly, when n=319, x\u22480.0009976, which is less than 0.001, so that's inside. So, the range of n is from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so n must be less than that, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but when n=3183, x is less than 0.0001, so it's outside. Therefore, n must be up to 3182.\n\nSimilarly, the lower bound: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so the smallest integer n is 319.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3182 - 319 = 2863\n\n2863 + 1 = 2864\n\nWait, that's different from the previous calculation where I thought it was 2865. So, where did I go wrong earlier?\n\nI think the mistake was that when I took n up to 3183, which actually gives x just below 0.0001, which is outside the interval. So, the correct upper limit is n=3182, which gives x\u22480.0001000385, which is inside (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nTherefore, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, let me check that again. So, 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 is 2864.\n\nBut let me test with smaller numbers to make sure. If I have numbers from 3 to 5 inclusive, that's 3,4,5: 3 numbers. 5 - 3 +1 = 3. So, yes, that formula works.\n\nSo, from 319 to 3182 inclusive, the count is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, I think the correct count is 2864.\n\nWait, let me compute 3182 - 319:\n\n3182 - 300 = 2882\n\n2882 - 19 = 2863\n\nSo, 3182 - 319 = 2863\n\nThen, 2863 + 1 = 2864.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that each n from 319 to 3182 gives a unique x-intercept in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, for each n in that range, x = 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001). So, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, let me check n=319:\n\nx = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(319*3.1415926535) \u2248 1/1002.314 \u2248 0.0009976, which is less than 0.001, so it's inside.\n\nn=3182:\n\nx \u2248 1/(3182*3.1415926535) \u2248 1/9996.15 \u2248 0.0001000385, which is just above 0.0001, so it's inside.\n\nn=3183:\n\nx \u2248 1/(3183*3.1415926535) \u2248 1/10001.13 \u2248 0.000099989, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive, giving 2864 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought 3183.09886184, so n=3183 would give x just below 0.0001, which is outside, so we stop at n=3182.\n\nSo, the total number is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check that 3182 - 319 is indeed 2863, and adding 1 gives 2864.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when dealing with inequalities, especially with reciprocals, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nWe have 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nTaking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities):\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, n must be integers greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest integer n is 3183, but wait, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000099989, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. Therefore, the largest n is 3182.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nThus, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so n ranges from 319 to 3182, giving 2864 intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2864}$"

    "text": " \n\nSo, in this case, \u03b8 is 1/x. Therefore, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0. Solving for x, that gives x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, each x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n. Now, I need to find all such x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nLet me write down the inequalities for x:\n\n0.0001 < x < 0.001\n\nSince x = 1/(n\u03c0), I can substitute that into the inequality:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nI need to find all integers n such that this inequality holds. Let me solve for n.\n\nFirst, let's take the left part of the inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides (and reverse the inequality sign because reciprocating reverses the inequality for positive numbers), I get:\n\n1/0.0001 > n\u03c0\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\n10000 > n\u03c0\n\nDividing both sides by \u03c0:\n\nn < 10000/\u03c0\n\nCalculating 10000 divided by \u03c0, which is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n is an integer, the maximum integer n can be is 3183.\n\nNow, let's take the right part of the inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, take reciprocals:\n\nn\u03c0 > 1/0.001\n\nWhich is:\n\nn\u03c0 > 1000\n\nDividing both sides by \u03c0:\n\nn > 1000/\u03c0\n\nCalculating 1000 divided by \u03c0, which is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184. Since n is an integer, the smallest integer n can be is 319.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. To find the number of integers from a to b inclusive, it's b - a + 1. So, plugging in the numbers:\n\nNumber of integers = 3183 - 319 + 1\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\nThen, 2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nSo, there are 2865 integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I set up the equation sin(1/x) = 0, which leads to 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). Then, I substituted x into the interval inequalities:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nSolving for n, I correctly took reciprocals and reversed the inequalities, leading to n\u03c0 > 1000 and n\u03c0 < 10000, which gives n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31 and n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The count is 3183 - 319 + 1, which is indeed 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check if 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Let me compute 1/(3183 * \u03c0). Let's compute 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.1416 \u2248 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, 3183 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0928. Adding these together: 9549 + 318.3 = 9867.3, +127.32 = 9994.62, +5.0928 \u2248 10,000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, does x = 1/(3183\u03c0) lie inside the interval? Let's see, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but since the interval is open, 0.0001 is excluded. Therefore, x must be greater than 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which implies n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, the maximum integer n is 3183, but we need to check if 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Since 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but exactly, 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001, which would mean that 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, which is outside the interval. Therefore, the maximum n should be 3182 instead of 3183.\n\nWait, that changes things. Let me recast this. If 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, then 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10,000, 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001, which is 0.0001. Therefore, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's not included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Let me check that.\n\nCompute 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 182\u03c0 \u2248 182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 182 * 3 = 546, 182 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 25.78, so total \u2248 546 + 25.78 \u2248 571.78. So, 3000\u03c0 + 182\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796 + 571.78 \u2248 9996.55796. Therefore, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9996.55796, so 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.55796 \u2248 0.000100034. So, that's just slightly above 0.0001, which is within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n can be 3182, giving x \u2248 0.000100034, which is inside the interval. So, n can go up to 3182.\n\nSimilarly, let's check n = 319. Compute 319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477796, 19\u03c0 \u2248 59.69026042, so total \u2248 942.477796 + 59.69026042 \u2248 1002.168056. Therefore, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.168056 \u2248 0.0009978, which is just below 0.001. Since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.001, so x = 0.0009978 is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval. Therefore, n can start at 319.\n\nSo, now, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that:\n\n3182 - 319 = 2863\n\n2863 + 1 = 2864\n\nTherefore, there are 2864 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but now it's 2864. So, I need to clarify this.\n\nThe key point is whether n = 3183 gives x = 1/(3183\u03c0) which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded, so the maximum n is 3182. Similarly, n = 319 gives x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009978 < 0.001, so it's included. Therefore, n starts at 319 and ends at 3182.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\nCompute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, 2882 - 19 = 2863.\n\nThen, 2863 + 1 = 2864.\n\nTherefore, the correct number is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. The number of zeros of sin(1/x) in (a, b) is equal to the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (a, b). So, the count is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)).\n\nWait, let me recall that the number of zeros in (a, b) is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)).\n\nWait, but let me think carefully. The zeros occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0), n integer. So, to find how many such x lie in (a, b), we need to find the number of integers n such that a < 1/(n\u03c0) < b.\n\nWhich is equivalent to 1/(b\u03c0) < n < 1/(a\u03c0).\n\nSo, n must be an integer strictly between 1/(b\u03c0) and 1/(a\u03c0).\n\nTherefore, the number of such integers is floor(1/(a\u03c0) - 1) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0) + 1) + 1? Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the number as floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)).\n\nWait, let me test with numbers. Let me compute 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, floor(1/(0.0001\u03c0)) = 3183.\n\nSimilarly, 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184. So, ceil(1/(0.001\u03c0)) = 319.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers n is 3183 - 319 + 1? Wait, no, because n must be greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. But since 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000, which is 1/0.0001, but the interval is open at 0.0001, so n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the number of zeros is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)). But here, floor(1/(a\u03c0)) = floor(10000/\u03c0) = 3183, and ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) = ceil(1000/\u03c0) = 319. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864. But wait, that's not the correct formula because we need to subtract and then add 1? Wait, no, because n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, but since 3183 is excluded, it ends at 3182, so the count is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nAlternatively, the formula is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) + 1? Wait, let me check with an example. Suppose a=0.0002, b=0.0003.\n\nCompute 1/(0.0002\u03c0) = 5000/\u03c0 \u2248 1591.549431, floor is 1591.\n\n1/(0.0003\u03c0) \u2248 10000/(3\u03c0) \u2248 1047.197551, ceil is 1048.\n\nSo, number of zeros would be 1591 - 1048 + 1 = 544.\n\nBut let's check: x = 1/(n\u03c0) must be between 0.0002 and 0.0003, so 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0002 => n < 1/(0.0002\u03c0) \u2248 1591.549431, so n \u2264 1591.\n\nAnd 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.0003 => n > 1/(0.0003\u03c0) \u2248 1047.197551, so n \u2265 1048.\n\nThus, n ranges from 1048 to 1591 inclusive. Number of integers is 1591 - 1048 + 1 = 544, which matches the formula floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) + 1.\n\nWait, but in our original problem, a=0.0001, b=0.001.\n\nSo, floor(1/(0.0001\u03c0)) = 3183, ceil(1/(0.001\u03c0)) = 319.\n\nSo, number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. But wait, earlier we saw that n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded because the interval is (0.0001, 0.001). So, n should go up to 3182, making the count 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nSo, which is correct? The formula suggests 2865, but our careful analysis suggests 2864 because n=3183 is excluded.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) + 1, but in this case, since 1/(a\u03c0) is 3183.09886184, floor is 3183, and 1/(b\u03c0) is 318.309886184, ceil is 319. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. But in reality, n=3183 is excluded, so the correct count is 2864.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the formula needs adjustment when the upper limit is exactly 1/(n\u03c0). Since our interval is open at 0.0001, which is 1/(3183\u03c0), we must exclude n=3183. Therefore, the correct count is 2864.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is correct because it counts all n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (a, b). So, if 1/(n\u03c0) > a and 1/(n\u03c0) < b, then n must satisfy n < 1/(a\u03c0) and n > 1/(b\u03c0). So, n must be in (1/(b\u03c0), 1/(a\u03c0)). Since n must be integer, the number of integers is floor(1/(a\u03c0) - \u03b5) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0) + \u03b5), where \u03b5 approaches 0 from the positive side. So, in our case, 1/(a\u03c0) \u2248 3183.09886184, so floor(1/(a\u03c0) - \u03b5) = 3183 - 1 = 3182, because as \u03b5 approaches 0, 1/(a\u03c0) - \u03b5 approaches 3183.09886184 - \u03b5, which is just below 3183.09886184, so floor is 3183. Wait, no, floor(3183.09886184 - \u03b5) is 3183 as long as \u03b5 < 0.09886184. So, floor remains 3183.\n\nSimilarly, ceil(1/(b\u03c0) + \u03b5) = ceil(318.309886184 + \u03b5). As \u03b5 approaches 0, 318.309886184 + \u03b5 approaches 318.309886184 from above, so ceil is 319.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. But wait, that contradicts our earlier analysis where n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded because the interval is open at 0.0001. So, perhaps the formula is not considering the open interval correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is designed for closed intervals, and for open intervals, we need to adjust.\n\nWait, let me think differently. The number of zeros is equal to the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (a, b). So, 1/(n\u03c0) > a => n < 1/(a\u03c0), and 1/(n\u03c0) < b => n > 1/(b\u03c0). So, n must satisfy 1/(b\u03c0) < n < 1/(a\u03c0).\n\nSince n must be integer, the smallest integer greater than 1/(b\u03c0) is ceil(1/(b\u03c0) + 1). Wait, no, ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to 1/(b\u03c0). Similarly, floor(1/(a\u03c0) - 1) gives the largest integer less than 1/(a\u03c0).\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is floor(1/(a\u03c0) - 1) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) + 1.\n\nWait, let me test with a=0.0001, b=0.001.\n\nCompute floor(1/(0.0001\u03c0) - 1) = floor(3183.09886184 - 1) = floor(3182.09886184) = 3182.\n\nceil(1/(0.001\u03c0)) = ceil(318.309886184) = 319.\n\nSo, number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nThat matches our earlier analysis. Therefore, the correct formula for open intervals is floor(1/(a\u03c0) - 1) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) + 1.\n\nTherefore, in our case, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nSo, after this careful consideration and checking, I conclude that the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. To find the number of such x in (0.0001, 0.001), we determine the range of n:\n\n1. 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n2. Solving for n gives 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3182.\n3. The number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}."

    "text": " \n\nGiven y = sin(1/x), setting this equal to zero gives sin(1/x) = 0. Therefore, 1/x must be an integer multiple of \u03c0. So, 1/x = n\u03c0, which implies that x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for each integer n such that x is in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nNow, I need to find all integers n for which 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me write that down:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nI can rewrite this inequality to solve for n. Let's take the reciprocal of all parts, remembering that taking reciprocals reverses the inequalities because all terms are positive.\n\nSo, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001.\n\nCalculating the reciprocals:\n\n1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000.\n\nSo, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nNow, divide all parts by \u03c0 to solve for n:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nLet me compute these values numerically.\n\nFirst, 1000 divided by \u03c0. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184.\n\nSimilarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, n must be an integer such that 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184.\n\nSince n must be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319 (since 318.309... is just above 318, so the next integer is 319), and the largest possible n is 3183 (since 3183.098... is just below 3184, so the integer part is 3183).\n\nNow, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and then add 1 (since both endpoints are inclusive). Wait, no, actually, it's 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me check that.\n\nWait, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, in this case, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n in that range. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me verify the calculations again.\n\nFirst, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so n starts at 319.\n\n10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so n ends at 3183.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864, and 2864 + 1 = 2865. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when you have a range from a to b inclusive, the number of integers is b - a + 1. So, if a is 319 and b is 3183, then it's 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nWait, 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, that's correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me take a smaller example to check. Suppose I have numbers from 2 to 5 inclusive. The numbers are 2,3,4,5. That's 4 numbers. Using the formula: 5 - 2 +1 = 4. Correct. So, applying the same logic here, it's 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the initial inequality. I had 0.0001 < x < 0.001, and x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nBut when I take reciprocals, I have to reverse the inequalities because all terms are positive. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, as I did before.\n\nSo, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check: 3183 - 319 is 2864, so adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to compute it is to note that the number of integers between a and b is floor(b) - ceil(a) +1.\n\nIn this case, a is 318.309886184, so ceil(a) is 319.\n\nb is 3183.09886184, so floor(b) is 3183.\n\nThus, number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer. The number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of x-intercepts of \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we set \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\). This occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for integer \\( n \\), leading to \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n\nWe need \\( x \\) in \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), so:\n\n\\[\n0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001\n\\]\n\nTaking reciprocals:\n\n\\[\n1000 < n\\pi < 10000\n\\]\n\nDividing by \\( \\pi \\approx 3.1415926535 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1000}{\\pi} \\approx 318.31 < n < \\frac{10000}{\\pi} \\approx 3183.098\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( n \\) ranges from 319 to 3183. The number of integers in this range is:\n\n\\[\n3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

    "text": " \n\nBut in this case, \u03b8 is 1/x. So, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0. That means x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, each x-intercept occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for some integer n. Now, I need to find all such x that lie within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, I should find all integers n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nLet me write that inequality down: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. I can solve for n by taking reciprocals, remembering that flipping the inequality signs when taking reciprocals because all terms are positive. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those, 1/0.001 is 1000 and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. \n\nTo find n, I can divide all parts by \u03c0. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute those values. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 1000 divided by \u03c0 is about 1000 / 3.1415926535. Let me compute that: 1000 \u00f7 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 / \u03c0 is about 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184.\n\nSo, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319, and the largest possible n is 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nTo find the number of integers between two numbers inclusive, I can subtract the smaller number from the larger one and add 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive.\n\nWait, hold on a second. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 1000 / \u03c0 is approximately 318.309886184, so the next integer n is 319. Similarly, 10000 / \u03c0 is approximately 3183.09886184, so the largest integer n is 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me think again: each n corresponds to an x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, each n from 319 to 3183 gives a distinct x-intercept in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that all these x-values indeed lie within (0.0001, 0.001). The smallest x is when n is largest, so x = 1/(3183\u03c0). Let me compute that: 3183\u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's see, 3000\u03c0 is about 9424.77796, so 3183\u03c0 is approximately 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute 3183 * 3.1415926535:\n\nFirst, 3000 * \u03c0 = 9424.77796\nThen, 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 180 * \u03c0 \u2248 565.486677646, and 3 * \u03c0 \u2248 9.42477796. So, 565.486677646 + 9.42477796 \u2248 574.911455606. So, total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796 + 574.911455606 \u2248 10,000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10,000 = 0.0001, which is the lower bound of the interval. But our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so we need x > 0.0001, which would mean n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so n = 3183 is acceptable because x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since the interval is open at 0.0001, we have to check if x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10,000 = 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 is slightly less than 10,000, because 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 10,000, but actually, 3183 * \u03c0 is approximately 10,000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 is slightly less than 10,000, 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly more than 0.0001, so it's within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, for n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000) = 0.001, but since 319\u03c0 is slightly more than 1000, so 1/(319\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.001, so that's also within the interval.\n\nWait, so perhaps my initial calculation is correct. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nBut let me check with specific examples. Let me take n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0). Let me compute 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 319 * 3 = 957, 319 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 319 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 300 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 42.47779605, and 19 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 2.690260417. So, total \u2248 42.47779605 + 2.690260417 \u2248 45.16805647. So, 319\u03c0 \u2248 957 + 45.16805647 \u2248 1002.168056. So, x = 1/1002.168056 \u2248 0.0009978, which is approximately 0.0009978, which is between 0.0001 and 0.001.\n\nSimilarly, for n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0). As calculated before, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so x \u2248 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 is just under 10,000, x is just over 0.0001, so it's within the interval.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that n = 3183 is indeed the last integer before 10000/\u03c0. Since 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so the integer part is 3183, so n = 3183 is the largest integer such that n \u2264 10000/\u03c0. Similarly, n = 319 is the smallest integer greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't include any n that would result in x outside the interval. For example, n = 318: x = 1/(318\u03c0). Let's compute that. 318\u03c0 \u2248 318 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's see, 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.477796, 18\u03c0 \u2248 56.54866776. So, total \u2248 942.477796 + 56.54866776 \u2248 999.0264638. So, x = 1/999.0264638 \u2248 0.001001, which is just over 0.001, so it's outside the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n = 318 gives x \u2248 0.001001, which is outside, so n must start at 319, which gives x \u2248 0.0009978, which is inside.\n\nSimilarly, n = 3184: x = 1/(3184\u03c0). Let's compute 3184\u03c0: 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so 3184\u03c0 \u2248 10,000 + \u03c0 \u2248 10,003.1415926535. So, x = 1/10,003.1415926535 \u2248 0.000099968, which is just under 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. Therefore, n = 3184 gives x \u2248 0.000099968, which is less than 0.0001, so outside. Therefore, n must end at 3183, which gives x \u2248 0.0001, but just over, so inside.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is indeed 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is each n corresponding to exactly one x-intercept? Yes, because for each integer n, x = 1/(n\u03c0) is unique, and sin(1/x) = 0 exactly at those points. So, each n gives exactly one x-intercept in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check if n can be zero or negative. Wait, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), x is positive, so 1/x is positive, so n must be positive integers because sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so n must be positive. So, we don't have to consider negative n or n=0, because that would give x negative or undefined, which is outside our interval.\n\nTherefore, the only n's we need to consider are positive integers from 319 to 3183, inclusive, giving 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive. So, the formula is (last - first) + 1. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about it differently: if I have numbers from 1 to N, the count is N. So, from 1 to 3183, there are 3183 numbers. From 1 to 318, there are 318 numbers. So, from 319 to 3183, it's 3183 - 318 = 2865. So, that's another way to see it, which confirms the count.\n\nTherefore, I think the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

Now, I need to find all such x that lie in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nLet me write down the inequalities for x. So, 0.0001 < x < 0.001.

Now, I can solve for n in this inequality to find the range of integers n that satisfy it. \n\nLet me take the reciprocal of all parts of the inequality, but I have to remember that taking reciprocals reverses the inequalities. So, if I take reciprocals, the inequality becomes 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. Calculating those, 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000.

Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. \n\nSo, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n can take integer values from the next integer after 318.309886184, which is 319, up to the integer just below 3183.09886184, which is 3183. \n\nWait, let me check: 318.309... so the next integer is 319. And 3183.098... so the largest integer less than that is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. \n\nNow, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers, inclusive, I can subtract the smaller from the larger and add one. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, 3183 - 319. Let me do the subtraction step by step. 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then minus 19 more is 2864. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. \n\nBut wait, hold on a second. Let me double-check that calculation because sometimes when subtracting, it's easy to make a mistake. So, 3183 - 319. Let's compute 3183 - 300 = 2883, and then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Yep, that's correct. So, adding 1 gives 2865. So, that would mean there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in setting up the inequality. I started with 0.0001 < x < 0.001, and since x = 1/(n\u03c0), then 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals, since all terms are positive, the inequality reverses, so 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Then, dividing by \u03c0 gives 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.31 < n < 3183.098. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. \n\nWait, but let me check another way. If n starts at 319, then the corresponding x is 1/(319\u03c0), and the next one is 1/(320\u03c0), and so on, up to 1/(3183\u03c0). So, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again. 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that seems correct. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check with specific values. For example, when n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(319 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/1002.63 \u2248 0.00099737. Wait, but 0.00099737 is greater than 0.0001, so that's within the interval. \n\nSimilarly, when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000.0000000015) \u2248 0.0001, but slightly less than 0.001? Wait, no, wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 1/10000, which is 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001. But our interval is from 0.0001 to 0.001, so 0.0001 is excluded, right? Wait, the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at both ends. So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. \n\nWait, but when n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000997, which is approximately 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so that's within the interval. Similarly, when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10000, so 1/10000 is 0.0001, but since it's an open interval, does x = 0.0001 count? No, because it's not included. So, the smallest x is just above 0.0001, which would correspond to n just below 3183.098. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the largest integer n is 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, which is excluded. So, does that mean that n can only go up to 3182? Wait, let me check. \n\nWait, 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001. So, if x must be greater than 0.0001, then 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which implies n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, which is not included in the interval. So, perhaps n can only go up to 3182? Let me check that. \n\nIf n = 3183, then x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded, so the next lower n is 3182. Let's compute x when n = 3182. x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000 - 3.1415926535) \u2248 approximately 1/9996.8584 \u2248 0.0001000315. Wait, that's still greater than 0.0001, so x = 1/(3182\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001000315, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. \n\nWait, so 1/(3182\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001000315, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Then, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, which is excluded. So, n can go up to 3182, but not 3183, because 3183 would give x = 0.0001, which is not included. \n\nWait, but earlier, when I calculated 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098, so n must be greater than that, so n starts at 319. And 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n must be less than that, so n can go up to 3183. But when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded, so perhaps n can only go up to 3182. \n\nWait, but let me check: 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound of the interval, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so x = 0.0001 is not included. Therefore, n must satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which is equivalent to n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, the maximum integer n is 3183, but n must be less than 3183.098, so n can be 3183 only if 1/(3183\u03c0) > 0.0001, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, so it's equal to 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded, so n must be less than or equal to 3182. \n\nWait, but that seems contradictory because earlier, when I computed 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n must be less than that, so n can be up to 3183, but since 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000, 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is not included. So, the maximum n is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) is just above 0.0001. \n\nSo, if n starts at 319 and goes up to 3182, inclusive, then the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that. 3182 - 319 is 2863, plus 1 is 2864. \n\nWait, that's different from my earlier calculation. So, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial calculation by including n = 3183, which gives x = 0.0001, which is excluded. So, the correct number of x-intercepts is 2864. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this. Let me compute 1/(3182\u03c0). Let's compute 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 182\u03c0 \u2248 571.895, so total is approximately 9424.77796 + 571.895 \u2248 10,000 - 0.0000000015 or something? Wait, 3182\u03c0 is approximately 3182 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute 3182 * 3 = 9546, 3182 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3182 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 3000 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 424.77796, and 182 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 approximately 25.763, so total \u2248 424.77796 + 25.763 \u2248 450.54096. So, total 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9546 + 450.54096 \u2248 9996.54096. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.54096 \u2248 approximately 0.0001000345. So, that's just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nSimilarly, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000.0000000015) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded. So, n can go up to 3182, so the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but now I'm getting 2864. Which one is correct? Let me think. When you have a range from a to b inclusive, the number of integers is b - a + 1. So, if a = 319 and b = 3182, then it's 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again. 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, 2864 integers. \n\nBut wait, let me check with a smaller example to make sure. Suppose I have numbers from 3 to 5 inclusive. That's 3,4,5, which is 3 numbers. 5 - 3 + 1 = 3, which is correct. So, in this case, 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864, which seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, where did I go wrong? I think I included n = 3183, which gives x = 0.0001, which is excluded, so that was incorrect. So, the correct number is 2864. \n\nWait, but let me make sure that n = 3182 is included. So, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9996.54, so 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000345, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. So, n = 3182 is valid. \n\nSo, to summarize, the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) where n is an integer from 319 to 3182 inclusive. The number of such integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. \n\nWait, but let me check another way. The number of zeros of sin(1/x) between a and b is approximately the number of times 1/x crosses multiples of \u03c0, so it's roughly proportional to the length of the interval in terms of 1/x. \n\nWait, but perhaps another approach is to consider how many times sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches zero. But in this case, we're only concerned with the interval from 0.0001 to 0.001. \n\nAlternatively, we can think of the function y = sin(1/x) and note that as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001, 1/x increases from 1000 to 10000. So, 1/x goes from 1000 to 10000 radians. The number of zeros of sin(\u03b8) between \u03b8 = 1000 and \u03b8 = 10000 is equal to the number of integers n such that n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000. \n\nSo, the number of zeros is the number of integers n where 1000 \u2264 n\u03c0 \u2264 10000. So, n ranges from ceiling(1000/\u03c0) to floor(10000/\u03c0). \n\nCompute ceiling(1000/\u03c0): 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so ceiling of that is 319. \n\nCompute floor(10000/\u03c0): 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so floor is 3183. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought that n = 3183 gives x = 0.0001, which is excluded, so perhaps floor(10000/\u03c0) should be 3183, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, perhaps we need to adjust. \n\nWait, but if \u03b8 = n\u03c0, and \u03b8 goes up to just below 10000 (since x is greater than 0.0001, \u03b8 = 1/x is less than 10000). So, n\u03c0 < 10000, so n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so n can be up to 3183, but n\u03c0 must be less than 10000, so n can be 3183 because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.0000000015, which is just over 10000, so perhaps n can only go up to 3182. \n\nWait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me approach it step by step. \n\nGiven that x is in (0.0001, 0.001), which is equivalent to 1/x being in (1000, 10000). So, \u03b8 = 1/x is in (1000, 10000). We need to find the number of integers n such that n\u03c0 is in (1000, 10000). \n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. \n\nDividing by \u03c0, we get 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184. \n\nSo, n must be an integer greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184. \n\nTherefore, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest integer n is 3183. \n\nBut wait, 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10000.0000000015, which is just over 10000. So, 3183\u03c0 is greater than 10000, which would mean that n = 3183 corresponds to \u03b8 = 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.0000000015, which is just over 10000. But since \u03b8 must be less than 10000, because x > 0.0001, then n must be less than 3183.09886184, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but 3183\u03c0 is just over 10000, which would correspond to x just under 0.0001, which is excluded. \n\nTherefore, the maximum n such that n\u03c0 < 10000 is n = 3183, but since 3183\u03c0 > 10000, then actually, the maximum n is 3182, because 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9996.54, which is less than 10000, so x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000345, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. \n\nWait, so if n = 3183 gives \u03b8 = 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.0000000015, which is just over 10000, so it's excluded. So, the maximum n is 3182. \n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. \n\nSo, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. \n\nWait, but let me confirm with another approach. The number of zeros of sin(1/x) in the interval (a, b) is equal to the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (a, b). So, a < 1/(n\u03c0) < b. \n\nSo, for a = 0.0001 and b = 0.001, we have 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which is equivalent to 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. \n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184. \n\nSo, n can be from 319 to 3183 inclusive, but since n = 3183 gives 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded, then n can only go up to 3182. \n\nTherefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. \n\nWait, but let me check with another example. Suppose I have a similar problem with a smaller interval. Let's say, find the number of x-intercepts of sin(1/x) in (0.1, 0.2). \n\nSo, 0.1 < x < 0.2, which implies 5 < 1/x < 10. So, \u03b8 = 1/x is between 5 and 10. The zeros occur at \u03b8 = n\u03c0, so n\u03c0 must be between 5 and 10. So, 5 < n\u03c0 < 10. Dividing by \u03c0, 5/\u03c0 \u2248 1.5915 < n < 10/\u03c0 \u2248 3.1831. So, n can be 2 or 3. So, two integers. \n\nWait, but let me compute the x-intercepts. For n = 2, x = 1/(2\u03c0) \u2248 0.15915, which is between 0.1 and 0.2, so included. For n = 3, x = 1/(3\u03c0) \u2248 0.1061, which is greater than 0.1, so included. For n = 4, x = 1/(4\u03c0) \u2248 0.0796, which is less than 0.1, so excluded. So, n can be 2 and 3, which is two integers, so the number of x-intercepts is 2, which matches the calculation. \n\nWait, but according to the formula, n starts at ceiling(5/\u03c0) = 2, and ends at floor(10/\u03c0) = 3, so 3 - 2 + 1 = 2, which is correct. \n\nSimilarly, in our original problem, n starts at ceiling(1000/\u03c0) = 319, and ends at floor(10000/\u03c0) = 3183. But since 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded, so we have to adjust the upper limit to 3182. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182, inclusive. \n\nSo, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. \n\nWait, but in the smaller example, we didn't have to adjust because n = 3 gave x = 1/(3\u03c0) \u2248 0.1061, which is greater than 0.1, so included. So, perhaps in our original problem, n = 3183 gives x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded, so we have to subtract one from the total count. \n\nWait, but in the smaller example, the upper limit was 10, and 10/\u03c0 \u2248 3.1831, so floor is 3, which is correct. So, perhaps in our original problem, even though 3183\u03c0 is just over 10000, it's still included because 10000 is the upper limit for \u03b8, but since \u03b8 must be less than 10000, because x > 0.0001, then \u03b8 must be less than 10000, so n must be less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so n can be up to 3183, but 3183\u03c0 is just over 10000, so it's excluded. Therefore, n can only go up to 3182. \n\nWait, but in the smaller example, n = 3 gives \u03b8 = 3\u03c0 \u2248 9.4248, which is less than 10, so included. So, in that case, it's correct. So, in our original problem, n = 3183 gives \u03b8 = 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.0000000015, which is just over 10000, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. \n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, I must have made a mistake in including n = 3183, which gives x = 0.0001, which is excluded. So, the correct number is 2864. \n\nWait, but let me check with another example to make sure. Suppose I have the interval (0.0002, 0.001). Then, 1/x is between 1000 and 5000. So, \u03b8 = 1/x is between 1000 and 5000. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 5000, so n is between ceiling(1000/\u03c0) \u2248 319 and floor(5000/\u03c0) \u2248 1591.549, so floor is 1591. So, the number of integers is 1591 - 319 + 1 = 1273. \n\nWait, but let me compute 1591 - 319: 1591 - 300 = 1291, then -19 more is 1272, plus 1 is 1273. So, that's correct. \n\nSimilarly, in our original problem, if we have \u03b8 between 1000 and 10000, n between 319 and 3183, but since 3183\u03c0 is just over 10000, we have to adjust to n = 3182. So, number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. \n\nWait, but let me check with a calculator to make sure that 3182\u03c0 is less than 10000. Let me compute 3182 * \u03c0. \n\n\u03c0 \u2248 3.141592653589793. \n\n3182 * 3.141592653589793 \u2248 \n\nLet me compute 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796077, \n\n182 * \u03c0 \u2248 571.89567873, \n\nSo, total \u2248 9424.77796077 + 571.89567873 \u2248 9996.6736395. \n\nSo, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9996.6736, which is less than 10000, so x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.6736 \u2248 0.000100034, which is greater than 0.0001, so included in the interval. \n\nSimilarly, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.141592653589793 \u2248 \n\n3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796077, \n\n183\u03c0 \u2248 575.0389844, \n\nTotal \u2248 9424.77796077 + 575.0389844 \u2248 9999.81694517, \n\nWait, that's approximately 9999.81694517, which is less than 10000, so 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.81694517, which is less than 10000, so x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.81694517 \u2248 0.0001000018, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. \n\nWait, wait, that contradicts my earlier assumption. So, if 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.81694517, which is less than 10000, then x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000018, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nWait, so perhaps my earlier conclusion was wrong. Let me re-examine this. \n\nIf 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.81694517, which is less than 10000, then 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000018, which is just barely above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. \n\nSo, that would mean that n can go up to 3183, because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.81694517 < 10000, so x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000018 > 0.0001, so it's included. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought that 3183\u03c0 was approximately 10000.0000000015, but that was a miscalculation. Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0 more accurately. \n\nCompute 3183 * \u03c0:\n\nLet me compute 3000 * \u03c0 = 9424.77796077\n\n183 * \u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.1"

    "text": " \n\nSo, setting up the equation: sin(1/x) = 0. That means 1/x must be equal to n\u03c0, right? So, 1/x = n\u03c0, which implies that x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer values of n. \n\nNow, I need to find all such x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, I can write this as 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), I can substitute this into the inequality to find the range of n. \n\nLet me write that down: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. To find the values of n, I can take reciprocals on all parts of the inequality, but I have to remember that taking reciprocals reverses the inequalities. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. \n\nCalculating those reciprocals: 1/0.001 is 1000, and 1/0.0001 is 10000. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Now, to solve for n, I can divide all parts by \u03c0. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. \n\nLet me compute these values numerically. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. Similarly, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. \n\nSo, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618 and less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n has to be an integer, the smallest integer greater than 318.30988618 is 319, and the largest integer less than 3183.0988618 is 3183. \n\nNow, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183, inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers, I can subtract the smaller number from the larger one and add 1. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. \n\nCalculating that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n in that range. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, starting from sin(1/x) = 0, which gives 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). Then, substituting into the interval, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so dividing by \u03c0, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. \n\nI also remember that as x approaches 0 from the positive side, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. Therefore, between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a small interval near zero, the function should have a lot of oscillations, leading to many x-intercepts. So, 2865 seems like a reasonable number. \n\nJust to be thorough, let me check a smaller example. Suppose I take the interval (0.1, 1). Then, x is between 0.1 and 1, so 1/x is between 1 and 10. So, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, 0.1 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 1. Taking reciprocals, 1 < n\u03c0 < 10, so n is from 1 to floor(10/\u03c0) \u2248 3.18, so n=1,2,3. That gives three x-intercepts. Let me count: x = 1/\u03c0 \u2248 0.318, which is between 0.1 and 1; x = 1/(2\u03c0) \u2248 0.159, also in the interval; x = 1/(3\u03c0) \u2248 0.106, which is just above 0.1. So, that's three intercepts, which matches the calculation. So, the method seems correct. \n\nTherefore, applying the same method to the given interval, I can be confident that the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Solving for x gives x = 1/(n\u03c0). Within the interval (0.0001, 0.001), we find the range of n by solving 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, leading to n between approximately 319 and 3183. The number of integers in this range is 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

Now, I need to find all such x within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nLet me write that down as inequalities:\n\n0.0001 < x < 0.001\n\nBut since x = 1/(n\u03c0), I can substitute that in:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nNow, I can solve for n in each inequality.

So, 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that.\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864, and then adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n in that range.

So, 10000/\u03c0 is approximately 3183.098, so n must be less than that, so the maximum integer n is 3183. Similarly, 1000/\u03c0 is approximately 318.309, so the minimum integer n is 319. Now, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865.

Now, I need to find all such x that lie within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). \n\nLet me write that down: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. I need to solve this inequality for n. Let me first handle the left part of the inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). If I take reciprocals on both sides, remembering that taking reciprocals reverses the inequality when both sides are positive, which they are here. So, 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0, which is 10000 > n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, I get n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating that, \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n is an integer, n \u2264 3183.\n\nNow, let's handle the right part of the inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, taking reciprocals, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0, which is 1000 < n\u03c0. Dividing both sides by \u03c0, we get n > 1000/\u03c0. Calculating that, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618. Since n is an integer, n \u2265 319.\n\nSo, putting both inequalities together, n must satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the numbers, that's 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive.\n\nWait a second, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is about 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183. Then, 1000 divided by \u03c0 is about 318.309, so n must be at least 319. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. The number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more gives 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but hold on, I should make sure that all these x-values are indeed within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), when n increases, x decreases. So, the smallest x is when n is largest, which is 3183, so x = 1/(3183\u03c0). Let me compute that to check. 3183 * \u03c0 is approximately 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 3183 * 3 = 9549, plus 3183 * 0.1416 \u2248 3183 * 0.1 is 318.3, 3183 * 0.04 is about 127.32, and 3183 * 0.0016 is about 5.0928. Adding those together: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.0928 \u2248 450.7128. So, total is 9549 + 450.7128 \u2248 9999.7128. So, 1 divided by that is approximately 1/9999.7128 \u2248 0.0001000028, which is just a bit more than 0.0001, so it's within the interval.\n\nSimilarly, when n is 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0). Let me compute that. 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 319 * 3 = 957, plus 319 * 0.1416 \u2248 319 * 0.1 = 31.9, 319 * 0.04 = 12.76, 319 * 0.0016 \u2248 0.5104. Adding those: 31.9 + 12.76 = 44.66 + 0.5104 \u2248 45.1704. So, total is 957 + 45.1704 \u2248 1001.1704. So, 1 divided by that is approximately 0.000998828, which is just less than 0.001, so it's within the interval.\n\nTherefore, all these x-values from n=319 to n=3183 are within (0.0001, 0.001). So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that some of these x-values might be outside the interval? I don't think so because we've already checked the endpoints. When n=319, x \u2248 0.000998828, which is just below 0.001, and when n=3183, x \u2248 0.0001000028, which is just above 0.0001. So, all the x-values for n between 319 and 3183 are within the interval.\n\nWait, but let me just check if n=3183 gives x just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=319 gives x just below 0.001, so it's included. So, yes, all the x-intercepts for n from 319 to 3183 are within the interval.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me compute that subtraction again: 3183 - 319. 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then minus 19 is 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. Yep, that's correct.\n\nHmm, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial setup. The function is sin(1/x), and x-intercepts occur when sin(1/x)=0, which is when 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that as x approaches 0 from the positive side, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is very close to zero, the function will oscillate a lot, crossing the x-axis many times.\n\nSo, each time n increases by 1, x decreases by a small amount, adding another x-intercept. So, the number of intercepts is the number of integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in (0.0001, 0.001). Which, as we found, is n from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 intercepts.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer should be 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine when \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).
