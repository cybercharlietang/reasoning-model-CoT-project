    "text": " Therefore, each n in 319 to 3183 gives exactly one x-intercept. So, the total number is 2865. I think that's the answer. But just to be extra careful, let me check the endpoints. When n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(319 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(1003.2) \u2248 0.0009968, which is approximately 0.001, but actually slightly less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Similarly, when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, which is exactly 0.0001, but since the interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), does x = 0.0001 count? Wait, no, because the interval is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, x = 0.0001 is excluded, and x = 0.001 is also excluded. So, when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is exactly the lower bound, so it's excluded. Similarly, n = 319 gives x \u2248 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Wait, but earlier I thought n goes up to 3183, but if n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, then maybe n should go up to 3182? Let me check that. So, x = 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183. But wait, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is exactly the lower bound, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001. Therefore, n=3183 would give x=0.0001, which is not included. So, the maximum n should be 3182. Let me recalculate. So, n must satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, the maximum integer n is 3183, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded. So, the largest n such that x > 0.0001 is n=3182. Let me check: x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000 - a bit) \u2248 0.0001000... something, which is just above 0.0001. So, n can go up to 3182. Similarly, for the upper bound, n must be greater than 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309, so the smallest n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Now, let's compute the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Using the formula: (3182 - 319) + 1. Let's compute 3182 - 319. 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863. Then add 1: 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but now considering that n=3183 gives x=0.0001 which is excluded, so the upper limit is n=3182, leading to 2864. Let me confirm with an example. Suppose n starts at 2 and ends at 5, but if n=5 gives x=0.001, which is excluded, then n should go up to 4. So, numbers are 2,3,4: count is 3. Using the formula: (4 - 2) +1 = 3. Correct. Similarly, if n starts at 319 and ends at 3182, the count is (3182 - 319) +1 = 2864. So, the correct number of x-intercepts is 2864. But wait, let me check the exact value of 1/(3183\u03c0). Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let me compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796. 183\u03c0 \u2248 183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 180\u03c0 \u2248 565.48667, and 3\u03c0\u22489.42477, so total \u2248565.48667 +9.42477\u2248574.91144. So, total 3183\u03c0 \u22489424.77796 + 574.91144 \u22489999.6894. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u22481/9999.6894\u22480.0001000031, which is just over 0.0001. Wait, that's interesting. So, 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001000031, which is greater than 0.0001, so x=0.0001000031 is just above 0.0001, so it is included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, in that case, n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001000031, which is within the interval. So, perhaps my earlier thought was wrong. Let me see: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u22483183.098. So, n can be up to 3183, because 3183 < 3183.098. So, n=3183 is allowed because 3183 < 3183.098. So, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001000031, which is just over 0.0001, so it is included. Therefore, n can go up to 3183. So, the number of x-intercepts is from n=319 to n=3183 inclusive, which is (3183 - 319) +1 = 2865. So, the correct count is 2865. I think I confused myself earlier by miscalculating the exact value.

Let me check the exact values to make sure that 1/(319\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001 and 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.001. Let's compute 1/(319\u03c0). \u03c0 \u2248 3.1416, so 319\u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 Let's compute 300\u03c0 \u2248 942.48, 19\u03c0 \u2248 59.69, so total \u2248 942.48 + 59.69 \u2248 1002.17. So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1002.17 \u2248 0.0009978, which is just under 0.001, so 0.0009978 < 0.001, so that's good. Now, 1/(3183\u03c0). Let's compute 3183\u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 Let's see, 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77, 183\u03c0 \u2248 575.08, so total \u2248 9424.77 + 575.08 \u2248 10,000 (approximately). So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10,000 = 0.0001, which is the lower bound. But since x must be greater than 0.0001, we need to check if 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but is it exactly 0.0001? Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0: 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let me compute step by step:\n\n3183 * 3 = 9549\n3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3\n3183 * 0.0415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32\n3183 * 0.0015926535 \u2248 Approximately 5.06\nAdding up: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.06 \u2248 450.68\nSo total \u03c0*3183 \u2248 9549 + 450.68 \u2248 10,000 (approx). So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but slightly less because 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10,000. Wait, no, if 3183\u03c0 is exactly 10,000, then 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001. But since \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, let's compute 3183 * \u03c0 more accurately.\n\nLet me compute 3183 * \u03c0:\n\nFirst, 3000 * \u03c0 = 9424.77796\n183 * \u03c0: Let's compute 100\u03c0 = 314.159265\n80\u03c0 = 251.327412\n3\u03c0 = 9.42477796\nSo, 100\u03c0 + 80\u03c0 + 3\u03c0 = 314.159265 + 251.327412 = 565.486677 + 9.42477796 \u2248 574.911455\nSo, total 3183\u03c0 = 9424.77796 + 574.911455 \u2248 9999.689415\n\nSo, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.689415, which is just under 10,000. Therefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.689415 \u2248 0.00010000314. So, 0.00010000314 is just over 0.0001, which is within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010000314 is indeed greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. Similarly, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009978 is less than 0.001, so it's included as well. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 2865 x-intercepts. Wait, but let me confirm: when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009978<0.001, so it's included. When n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.00010000314>0.0001, so it's included. So, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive are valid, giving 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865 intercepts. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer n. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), n ranges from 319 to 3183, yielding 2865 intercepts.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

We find the range of n such that x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, leading to n from 319 to 3183. The number of integers in this range is 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"
