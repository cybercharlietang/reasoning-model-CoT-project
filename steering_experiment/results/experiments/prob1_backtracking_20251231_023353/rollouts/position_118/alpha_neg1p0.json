    "text": " So, 3183 - 319 = Let me compute 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me think again: each time n increases by 1, x decreases by a certain amount, but in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept. So, the total number is indeed the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 2865. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me just check if n=3183 is actually within the interval. As I calculated earlier, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000031, which is just a tiny bit above 0.0001, so it is included in the open interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=319 gives x \u2248 0.00099784, which is just below 0.001, so it's included as well. Therefore, both endpoints are included in the interval, so the count from n=319 to n=3183 is correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is to consider how many times sin(1/x) crosses the x-axis between x=0.0001 and x=0.001. Since as x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, and sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a finite interval, the function will oscillate a finite number of times, each crossing the x-axis twice per period (once going up, once going down). Wait, no, actually, each period of sin(\u03b8) has two x-intercepts: one at \u03b8 = n\u03c0 and another at \u03b8 = (n+1)\u03c0, but wait, no, actually, sin(\u03b8) is zero at \u03b8 = n\u03c0, so each zero crossing is at \u03b8 = n\u03c0, so each zero crossing is a single point, not two. Wait, no, actually, sin(\u03b8) crosses zero at each multiple of \u03c0, so each zero crossing is a single point where the function crosses from positive to negative or vice versa. So, each zero crossing is a single point, so the number of zeros in the interval is equal to the number of n's such that 1/(n\u03c0) lies in (0.0001, 0.001). So, that's exactly what I computed earlier: 2865 zeros. Wait, but let me think again: as x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000. So, \u03b8 = 1/x goes from 10000 to 1000 radians. The number of zeros of sin(\u03b8) between \u03b8=1000 and \u03b8=10000 is equal to the number of multiples of \u03c0 in that interval. So, the number of zeros is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0). Let me compute that. 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so floor(10000/\u03c0) = 3183. 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so ceil(1000/\u03c0) = 319. Therefore, the number of zeros is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that's the same result as before. So, this method also gives 2865 zeros. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistake in this alternative approach. So, \u03b8 goes from 1000 to 10000. The number of zeros of sin(\u03b8) in [a, b] is floor(b/\u03c0) - ceil(a/\u03c0) + 1. So, in this case, a = 1000, b = 10000. So, floor(10000/\u03c0) = 3183, ceil(1000/\u03c0) = 319. So, number of zeros is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about how many oscillations occur in that interval. The function sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. The number of oscillations between x = a and x = b is approximately (1/a - 1/b)/(2\u03c0). Wait, let me compute that. So, the number of periods of sin(1/x) between x = a and x = b is (1/a - 1/b)/(2\u03c0). So, in our case, a = 0.0001, b = 0.001. So, 1/a = 10000, 1/b = 1000. So, (10000 - 1000)/(2\u03c0) = 9000/(2\u03c0) \u2248 9000/(6.2832) \u2248 1432.39. So, approximately 1432.39 periods. Each period has two zeros (positive and negative crossing), but wait, no, each period has one maximum, one minimum, and two zeros. Wait, no, actually, sin(\u03b8) crosses zero twice per period: once going from positive to negative, and once from negative to positive. Wait, no, actually, each period of sin(\u03b8) has two zeros: at \u03b8 = n\u03c0 and \u03b8 = (n+1)\u03c0, but actually, each zero is a single point where the function crosses the axis. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing this with the number of times it crosses. Actually, in each period, sin(\u03b8) crosses zero twice: once at the start of the period and once in the middle. Wait, no, let me think. The period of sin(\u03b8) is 2\u03c0. So, in each interval of length \u03c0, sin(\u03b8) goes from 0 up to 1, back to 0, down to -1, and back to 0. So, in each \u03c0 interval, there are two zeros: one at the start and one at the end. So, in each 2\u03c0 interval, there are two zeros? Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me plot sin(\u03b8). From \u03b8 = 0 to \u03b8 = \u03c0, sin(\u03b8) goes from 0 up to 1 and back to 0. So, it crosses zero at \u03b8=0 and \u03b8=\u03c0. Then, from \u03b8=\u03c0 to \u03b8=2\u03c0, it goes from 0 down to -1 and back to 0. So, in each 2\u03c0 interval, there are two zeros: at \u03b8=0, \u03b8=\u03c0, and \u03b8=2\u03c0. Wait, but that's three zeros in 2\u03c0. Wait, no, because at \u03b8=0, it's the start, and then \u03b8=\u03c0 is one zero crossing, and \u03b8=2\u03c0 is another. So, in each 2\u03c0 interval, there are two zeros: one at \u03b8=\u03c0 and one at \u03b8=2\u03c0. Wait, no, actually, in the interval [0, 2\u03c0], sin(\u03b8) is zero at \u03b8=0, \u03b8=\u03c0, and \u03b8=2\u03c0. So, three zeros. But between \u03b8=0 and \u03b8=2\u03c0, excluding the endpoints, there are two zeros: at \u03b8=\u03c0 and \u03b8=2\u03c0. Wait, no, because \u03b8=2\u03c0 is the same as \u03b8=0, so perhaps in the open interval (0, 2\u03c0), there's only one zero at \u03b8=\u03c0. Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let me clarify: the number of zeros of sin(\u03b8) in the interval [a, b] is equal to the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 in [a, b]. So, if a \u2264 n\u03c0 \u2264 b, then each such n contributes a zero at \u03b8 = n\u03c0. So, the number of zeros is floor(b/\u03c0) - ceil(a/\u03c0) + 1. So, in our case, \u03b8 ranges from 1000 to 10000. So, the number of zeros is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0) +1 = 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, that's consistent with our earlier calculation. Therefore, the number of zeros is indeed 2865. So, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider a smaller interval and see if the formula holds. Suppose I take x in (0.1, 0.2). Then, \u03b8 = 1/x would be in (5, 10). The number of zeros would be the number of n\u03c0 in (5,10). So, n must satisfy 5 < n\u03c0 < 10, so n > 5/\u03c0 \u2248 1.5915 and n < 10/\u03c0 \u2248 3.1831. So, n=2,3. So, two zeros. Let's compute using the formula: floor(10/\u03c0) = 3, ceil(5/\u03c0)=2. So, 3 - 2 +1=2. Correct. So, the formula works here. Similarly, in our problem, the formula gives 2865, which seems correct.\n\nTherefore, after all these checks and alternative approaches, I'm confident that the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nBut wait, let me just think again: the function sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times as x approaches 0, but in this case, the interval is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a finite interval, albeit very close to zero. But in this interval, the function will oscillate between 1/x going from 10000 to 100000 as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001. Wait, no, when x increases from 0.0001 to 0.001, 1/x decreases from 10000 to 1000. So, 1/x goes from 10000 down to 1000 as x goes from 0.0001 to 0.001. So, the function sin(1/x) will complete a certain number of oscillations as 1/x goes from 10000 to 1000. Each time 1/x passes a multiple of \u03c0, we get an x-intercept. So, the number of zeros is the number of times 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. So, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Wait, that's another way to think about it. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n must be between 1000/\u03c0 and 10000/\u03c0. Calculating those: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183, which is the same as before.

Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me think about the behavior of sin(1/x) near x approaching 0. As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. But in our case, x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a finite interval, albeit very close to zero. But within this interval, sin(1/x) will oscillate, crossing the x-axis each time 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0. So, each time 1/x = n\u03c0, which gives x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, the number of zeros in (a, b) where a = 0.0001 and b = 0.001 is equal to the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (a, b). So, as we determined, n must satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) > a and 1/(n\u03c0) < b. So, n must be between 1/(b\u03c0) and 1/(a\u03c0). So, n must be greater than 1/(b\u03c0) and less than 1/(a\u03c0). Since n must be an integer, the number of such n is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) + 1, but wait, let me make sure.\n\nWait, actually, the number of integers between two numbers m and n is floor(n) - ceil(m) + 1, if m < n. So, in our case, m = 1/(b\u03c0) \u2248 318.309, and n = 1/(a\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, the number of integers between m and n is floor(n) - ceil(m) + 1. So, floor(3183.098) = 3183, ceil(318.309) = 319. So, 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, that's consistent with what I had earlier. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I'm not making any off-by-one errors, let me think about smaller intervals. Suppose I have a function that crosses zero at x = 1/(n\u03c0), and I want to find the number of zeros between x = 0.1 and x = 0.2. Then, 1/(n\u03c0) must be between 0.1 and 0.2. So, 0.1 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.2. Solving for n: 1/(0.2\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.1\u03c0). So, 1/(0.2\u03c0) \u2248 1/0.6283 \u2248 1.5915, and 1/(0.1\u03c0) \u2248 3.1831. So, n must be integers greater than 1.5915 and less than 3.1831, so n=2 and n=3. So, two x-intercepts. Let's check: x = 1/(2\u03c0) \u2248 0.15915, which is between 0.1 and 0.2, and x = 1/(3\u03c0) \u2248 0.1061, which is also between 0.1 and 0.2. So, two intercepts, which matches floor(3.1831) - ceil(1.5915) +1 = 3 - 2 +1 = 2. So, the formula works here.\n\nAnother test: interval (0.05, 0.1). Then, 0.05 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.1. So, 1/(0.1\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.05\u03c0). 1/(0.1\u03c0) \u2248 3.1831, 1/(0.05\u03c0) \u2248 6.3662. So, n=4,5,6. That's three integers. So, number of intercepts should be 3. Let's check: x=1/(4\u03c0)\u22480.0796, which is between 0.05 and 0.1; x=1/(5\u03c0)\u22480.0637, also in the interval; x=1/(6\u03c0)\u22480.05305, which is just above 0.05, so included in (0.05, 0.1). So, three intercepts. Using the formula: floor(6.3662)=6, ceil(3.1831)=4. So, 6 -4 +1=3. Correct. So, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, applying it to our original problem, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, the answer is 2865.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute 1/(0.0001\u03c0) and 1/(0.001\u03c0) numerically to make sure I didn't make any approximation errors.\n\n1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\n1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.309886184 and less than 3183.09886184.

Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me think about the behavior of the function y = sin(1/x). As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly between -1 and 1. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is very close to zero, the function will oscillate a lot. Each time 1/x crosses a multiple of \u03c0, we get an x-intercept. So, the number of oscillations is roughly proportional to 1/x. Wait, but in our calculation, we found that the number of x-intercepts is 2865, which seems like a lot. Let me check the math again.\n\nWe have x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, 1/x is in (1000, 10000). So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. Now, sin(\u03b8) = 0 when \u03b8 is an integer multiple of \u03c0, so \u03b8 = n\u03c0. So, in the interval \u03b8 \u2208 (1000, 10000), the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, solving for n:\n\nn > 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.309\n\nn < 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.098\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.

Since each n gives a distinct x = 1/(n\u03c0), and each x is in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), and each x corresponds to exactly one n, then the count should be accurate. So, I think the answer is 2865.\n\nBut let me just think again: the function sin(1/x) has an infinite number of oscillations as x approaches zero, but in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a finite interval, the number of zeros should be finite. So, 2865 seems plausible.\n\nWait, but let me compute the exact difference: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865.

Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any overlap or if any n might produce the same x. But since n is an integer and x = 1/(n\u03c0), each n gives a unique x, so no duplicates. Therefore, the total number is indeed 2865. So, I think that's the answer. It's a bit of a large number, but considering the function sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely as x approaches 0, but in this case, we're only considering up to x=0.001, so the number of oscillations is finite but quite large. Yeah, so I think 2865 is the correct number of x-intercepts in that interval.\n\nWait, but let me check my initial substitution again. I set sin(1/x) = 0, which implies 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). That's correct. So, the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer n. Then, substituting into the interval (0.0001, 0.001), we get 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n gives n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098 and n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which gives 2865 intercepts. So, I think that's correct.\n\nJust to make sure, let me consider a smaller interval and see if the formula works. Suppose I take (0.0005, 0.0006). Then, 1/x would be between 1/0.0006 \u2248 1666.6667 and 1/0.0005 = 2000. So, 1/x is between approximately 1666.6667 and 2000. Then, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so n\u03c0 must be between 1666.6667 and 2000. So, n must be between 1666.6667/\u03c0 \u2248 530.5 and 2000/\u03c0 \u2248 636.94. So, n ranges from 531 to 636 inclusive. The number of integers is 636 - 531 +1 = 106. Let me check with the formula: 1/(0.0005\u03c0) \u2248 2000/3.1416 \u2248 636.94, so n > 636.94, so n starts at 637. Wait, wait, that's conflicting. Wait, no, wait: if x is between 0.0005 and 0.0006, then 1/x is between 1666.6667 and 2000. So, n\u03c0 must be in that range. So, n must satisfy 1666.6667 < n\u03c0 < 2000. So, n > 1666.6667/\u03c0 \u2248 530.5 and n < 2000/\u03c0 \u2248 636.94. So, n ranges from 531 to 636 inclusive. So, number of integers is 636 - 531 +1 = 106. So, if I use the formula: lower n = floor(1/(0.0006\u03c0)) +1? Wait, no, in this case, n must be greater than 530.5, so n starts at 531, and less than 636.94, so n ends at 636. So, 636 - 531 +1 = 106. So, that's correct. So, applying the same logic, in the original problem, n ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 intercepts. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: The function sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. The number of oscillations between x = a and x = b (where 0 < a < b) is roughly proportional to the difference in 1/x between a and b. Specifically, the number of zeros should be approximately the difference between 1/(a\u03c0) and 1/(b\u03c0), since each zero occurs at intervals of \u03c0 in the argument of the sine function. So, in this case, a = 0.0001, b = 0.001. So, 1/a = 10000, 1/b = 1000. So, the number of zeros would be approximately (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 = 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866. But since we're dealing with exact counts, we have to adjust for the endpoints. However, our earlier calculation gave 2865, which is very close to this approximation. The slight difference is because we're counting integers and the approximation is continuous. So, that gives me more confidence that 2865 is correct.\n\nWait, but in the approximation, I got 2866, but the exact count is 2865. That's because when you subtract 10000 - 1000, you get 9000, and 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.23. But since we're dealing with discrete integers, the exact count is the floor of that value, which would be 2866, but in our exact calculation, it's 2865. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approximation. Let me think again. Wait, the number of zeros between x = a and x = b is given by the number of n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is between a and b. So, the number of n is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) +1. Wait, in our case, a = 0.0001, b = 0.001. So, 1/(a\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so floor(1/(a\u03c0)) = 3183. 1/(b\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) = 319. Therefore, the number of n is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, that's correct. So, the formula is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) +1. So, in the smaller example, a = 0.0005, b = 0.0006. 1/(a\u03c0) \u2248 636.94, floor(636.94) = 636. 1/(b\u03c0) \u2248 530.5, ceil(530.5) = 531. So, number of n is 636 - 531 +1 = 106, which matches our earlier count. So, the formula works. Therefore, applying it to the original problem, we get 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nSo, to recap: The function y = sin(1/x) has zeros at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for each integer n. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), these x-intercepts occur when 1/(n\u03c0) is between 0.0001 and 0.001. Solving for n gives n between approximately 318.309 and 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I've checked the logic with smaller examples, ensured that the endpoints are correctly handled, and confirmed that the formula gives the correct count. So, I'm confident that the answer is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0).

The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."
