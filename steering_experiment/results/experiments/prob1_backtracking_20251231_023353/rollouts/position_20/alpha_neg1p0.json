Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) < n Calculating that: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.3098862 So, n > approximately 318.3098862. Since n must be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319. So, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think: The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in that interval. Wait, let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I set sin(1/x) = 0, so 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). Then, I substituted x into the interval, getting 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Then, I solved for n in both inequalities, getting n > 1000/(\u03c0) \u2248 318.3098862 and n < 10000/(\u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Then, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. That seems correct. So, I think the answer is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nSolving for n:\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.10\n\nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3183. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) Calculating that: 1 / (0.001 * \u03c0) = 1 / 0.00314159265 \u2248 318.309886184 So, n > 318.309886184. Since n is an integer, the smallest n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between a and b inclusive, it's b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = Let's compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864; 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems like a lot of intercepts. Let me verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, x must be between 0.0001 and 0.001, so 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. So, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0, so 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). Therefore, x must be in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities because reciprocating positive numbers reverses the inequality): 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Then, dividing each part by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be integers greater than 318.309... and less than 3183.098..., so n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864; 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, that's 2865 intercepts. Wait, that seems correct? But I'm a bit surprised because that's a lot of intercepts in such a small interval. Let me think about it. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches zero. So, in the interval from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is from 10^-4 to 10^-3, the function sin(1/x) will oscillate between -1 and 1, crossing the x-axis each time 1/x increases by \u03c0. So, the number of zeros should be roughly the difference in 1/x divided by \u03c0. So, 1/0.001 = 1000, and 1/0.0001 = 10000. So, the difference is 9000. Divided by \u03c0, that's about 9000/3.1416 \u2248 2866. So, that's about 2866 zeros. Hmm, so my calculation of 2865 is very close to that estimate. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) crosses the x-axis whenever 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0, i.e., at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. Thus, n ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 intercepts.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

Now, let's take the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) Calculating the right side: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.3098 So, n must be greater than approximately 318.3098. Since n is an integer, the minimum possible n here is 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to count how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers inclusive, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add 1. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. Wait, 3183 - 319 is 2864? Let me compute that again. 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then minus 19 more is 2864. Yes, that's correct. So, adding 1 gives 2865. But wait, let me think again. The x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for n from 319 to 3183. So, each n in that range corresponds to exactly one x-intercept. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts should be equal to the number of integers n in that range. So, 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me double-check the initial substitution. When x is in (0.0001, 0.001), then 1/x is in (1000, 10000). So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. So, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, meaning n\u03c0 must be in (1000, 10000). Therefore, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. That seems correct. But wait, let me think about whether x=1/(n\u03c0) falls exactly into the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Let me check for n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.61) \u2248 0.000997, which is just under 0.001, so it's within the interval.

Similarly, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) Calculating this: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.3098 So, n > approximately 318.3098. Since n has to be an integer, n must satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Now, let's check if these values of n indeed give x within the interval. When n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.13) \u2248 0.0009968, which is just above 0.0001. When n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.00098) \u2248 0.000099999, which is just below 0.001. Wait, hold on, 0.000099999 is actually less than 0.0001, so that would be outside the interval. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me double-check. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, when n = 319, x \u2248 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001, so that's good. When n = 3183, x \u2248 0.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so that's outside the lower bound. So, the maximum n should be such that x is greater than 0.0001. Let me solve for n when x = 0.0001: 0.0001 = 1/(n\u03c0) \u21d2 n = 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988. So, n must be less than 3183.0988, so the maximum integer n is 3183. But as I saw earlier, n=3183 gives x \u2248 0.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, which would give x \u2248 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.00098) \u2248 0.000099999, but wait, that's the same as before. Wait, no, 3182\u03c0 is approximately 3182*3.1416 \u2248 10000.00098, so 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099999, which is still less than 0.0001. So, maybe n=3183 is too big, but n=3182 is also too big? Wait, that can't be. Let me think again. When x = 0.0001, n would be 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988, so n must be less than that. So, the maximum integer n is 3183, but that gives x just below 0.0001, which is not in the interval. So, actually, n must be less than 3183.0988, so n can be up to 3183, but that x is less than 0.0001, so not included. Therefore, the maximum n that gives x > 0.0001 is n=3183 - 1 = 3182. Wait, let me calculate x for n=3182: x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182*3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000.00098) \u2248 0.000099999, which is still less than 0.0001. Hmm, so maybe I need to find the smallest n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. Let's solve for n: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988. So, n must be less than 3183.0988, meaning the maximum integer n is 3183. But as we saw, n=3183 gives x \u2248 0.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not in the interval. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, but let's check x for n=3182: x \u2248 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099999, still less than 0.0001. Wait, this seems like a loop. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's instead consider that x must be greater than 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988. So, n must be less than 3183.0988, meaning the maximum integer n is 3183, but as we saw, that gives x just below 0.0001, which is not included. So, perhaps n can be up to 3182, but let's check x for n=3182: x \u2248 1/(3182*3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000.00098) \u2248 0.000099999, which is still less than 0.0001. So, maybe n=3181: x \u2248 1/(3181\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.00098 - 3.1416) \u2248 1/(9996.8584) \u2248 0.00010003, which is just above 0.0001. So, n=3181 gives x \u2248 0.00010003, which is within the interval. So, the smallest n is 319, as we saw earlier, giving x \u2248 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001. Wait, but 0.0009968 is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, the n's start at n=319 (x\u22480.0009968) and go up to n=3181 (x\u22480.00010003). So, the number of integers from 319 to 3181 inclusive. To find the number of integers between a and b inclusive, it's b - a + 1. So, 3181 - 319 + 1 = 3181 - 319 = 2862 +1=2863. Wait, but let me check: 3181 - 319 = 2862, so adding 1 gives 2863. But wait, let me confirm with smaller numbers. For example, from 3 to 5 inclusive: 5-3+1=3 numbers: 3,4,5. So, yes, that formula works. So, 3181 - 319 +1=2863. Therefore, there are 2863 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But wait, let me double-check. Alternatively, the number of n's is from n=319 to n=3181. So, the count is 3181 - 319 +1=2863. Alternatively, we can think of it as the number of integers between 319 and 3181 inclusive. Yes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 2863 x-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, leading to x = 1/(n\u03c0).

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 1/(0.0001\u03c0) is indeed 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886, so n must be less than that, so n_max is 3183. Similarly, 1/(0.001\u03c0) is 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886, so n must be greater than that, so n_min is 319. Then, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. Yep, that seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. Within the interval (0.0001, 0.001), we find that n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of such integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

Since n is an integer, n \u2264 3183.\n\nNow, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) Calculating the right side: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.3098 So, n must be greater than approximately 318.3098. Since n is an integer, n \u2265 319.\n\nSo, putting it all together, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183. To find the number of integers between two numbers inclusive, I can subtract the smaller number from the larger one and add 1. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me calculate that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with the inequalities:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nSo, solving for n:\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, we get n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988, so n \u2264 3183.\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, we get n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098, so n \u2265 319.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the function y = sin(1/x). As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a small interval near 0, the function will oscillate very rapidly. Each oscillation corresponds to a period of 2\u03c0 in the argument of the sine function. So, the number of zeros should correspond to the number of periods in that interval.\n\nBut wait, I think my initial approach using n is more straightforward and accurate for this problem. So, I'm confident that the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

Since n is an integer, the smallest possible n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, to find the number of integers in this range, I subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, number of x-intercepts = 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 = 2864; 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. So, 1/(0.0001\u03c0) is indeed 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618, so n must be less than that, so the maximum integer n is 3183.

The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me think again: as x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a finite interval, but very close to zero, the function will oscillate a lot. Each oscillation crosses the x-axis twice, except maybe the first one. But wait, in our case, we're only considering when sin(1/x) is zero, which occurs once per period, right? Because sin(\u03b8) is zero at \u03b8 = n\u03c0, so each x-intercept corresponds to one zero crossing. So, each n gives exactly one x-intercept. So, the number of zeros is equal to the number of integers n in that range, which is 2865. Wait, but let me check the exact values. Let me compute 1/(n\u03c0) for n=319 and n=3183 to make sure they lie within (0.0001, 0.001). For n=319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(319*3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(1003.03) \u2248 0.000997. Which is approximately 0.000997, which is less than 0.001 and greater than 0.0001. So, that's within the interval.

    "text": " 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) = 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1416 \u2248 3183.0988 So, n < approximately 3183.0988. Since n must be an integer, the maximum integer n can be is 3183. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) Calculating the right side: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.3098 So, n must be greater than approximately 318.3098. Since n is an integer, the smallest integer n can be is 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183, inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Wait, that seems too high. Let me check my calculations again. Wait, 3183 - 319 is 2864? Wait, 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more gives 2864. So, 2864 +1 = 2865. Hmm, but let me verify if n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. So, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 +1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me think again. Is each n corresponding to a unique x in the interval? Let me check with n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.87) \u2248 0.000997, which is approximately 0.001, but wait, 0.000997 is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Wait, but 1/(319\u03c0) is approximately 0.000997, which is just below 0.001. Similarly, n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.00) = 0.0001, but wait, 3183\u03c0 is approximately 3183*3.1416 \u2248 10000, so x\u22480.0001, but since our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), does x=0.0001 count? No, because it's an open interval, so x must be greater than 0.0001. So, n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001, which is not included. So, perhaps the maximum n is 3182. Let me check: 3182\u03c0 \u2248 3182*3.1416 \u2248 3182*3=9546, 3182*0.1416\u2248450. So total\u22489546+450\u22489996. So, x\u22481/9996\u22480.00010004, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. So, n=3182 gives x\u22480.00010004, which is in (0.0001, 0.001). So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 +1 = 3182 -319=2863, +1=2864. Wait, so earlier I thought n went up to 3183, but since x=1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, which is excluded, so n should go up to 3182. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, let me compute 3182 -319 +1: 3182-319=2863, +1=2864. So, 2864 x-intercepts. Wait, but let me check with n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is not included, so n=3183 is excluded. So, the maximum n is 3182. So, the number of integers is from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 -319 +1=2864. So, the answer is 2864. Wait, but let me confirm: 3182 -319=2863, plus 1 is 2864. Yes, that seems correct.

Since n is an integer, the smallest possible n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. Now, to find how many integers are in this range, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 + 1. Wait, that seems off. Let me think again. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the count is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n in that range. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check. When x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000 radians. Now, how many zeros does sin(\u03b8) have between \u03b8 = 1000 and \u03b8 = 10000? Each zero occurs at \u03b8 = n\u03c0, so n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must be between 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098862 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, which is the same as before. So, the number of n's is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that makes sense. Each time n increases by 1, \u03b8 increases by \u03c0, which is about 3.1416, so between 1000 and 10000, which is a span of 9000 radians, the number of zeros would be roughly 9000 / \u03c0 \u2248 2866.

That means n can take integer values from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. Now, to find how many integers are in this range, we subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. First, the lower bound: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n can be up to 3183. Upper bound: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309886184, so n starts at 319. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 x-intercepts in that interval. Wait, but let me think again. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. So, in the interval from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is a small interval near zero, the function will oscillate rapidly, crossing the x-axis many times. Each zero crossing corresponds to an n value, so the number of zeros should be roughly proportional to the reciprocal of the interval's width in terms of 1/x. Hmm, but my calculation gives 2865, which seems correct based on the math. Let me check if I considered all possible n's correctly. For x between 0.0001 and 0.001, 1/x is between 1000 and 10,000. So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10,000. The zeros occur at multiples of \u03c0, so between 1000 and 10,000, how many multiples of \u03c0 are there? The number of zeros would be approximately (10,000 - 1000)/\u03c0, but since each zero is at n\u03c0, the number of n's is floor(10,000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0). Let's compute 10,000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so floor of that is 3183. 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so ceil of that is 319. So, the number of n's is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865, which matches my earlier result. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). For x in (0.0001, 0.001), 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10,000. The smallest n is 319 (since 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31) and the largest is 3183 (since 10,000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.10).

Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me verify the range of n again. Starting with x = 1/(n\u03c0). We have x > 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u2192 n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.09886184, so n \u2264 3183. And x < 0.001 \u2192 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u2192 n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309886184, so n \u2265 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of it as starting from n = 319 up to n = 3183. So, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Yep, that's 2865. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) has x-intercepts where \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\).

Now, let's take the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Again, multiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, divide both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) Calculating that: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.309 So, n > approximately 318.309. Since n must be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1. Wait, no, actually, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, it would be 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, that suggests there are 2865 x-intercepts in that interval. But wait, I should double-check my calculations because that seems like a lot. Let me confirm the steps again. Starting with x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 1/x is in (1000, 10000). Because 1/0.001 = 1000 and 1/0.0001 = 10000. So, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. Now, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000. Therefore, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing all parts by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).

Similarly, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) Calculating that: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.3098862 So, n > approximately 318.3098862. Since n must be an integer, n must satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Now, let's find the number of integers between 319 and 3183, inclusive. To find this, subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both ends are inclusive). So, 3183 - 318 = 2865, and 2865 + 1 = 2866. Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check. Actually, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, so that's 2865 integers. But wait, let me check the calculations again because 1/(0.0001\u03c0) is approximately 3183.0988618, so n must be less than that, meaning n can be up to 3183. Similarly, n must be greater than 318.3098862, so the smallest integer n is 319. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n, each corresponding to an x-intercept in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me think again. Is each n in that range giving a unique x in the interval? Yes, because x = 1/(n\u03c0), and as n increases, x decreases. So, each n from 319 up to 3183 will give a distinct x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me verify the endpoints. When n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.237) \u2248 0.0009977, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. When n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.00003) \u2248 0.0001, but wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but since 0.0001 is the lower bound and it's not included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), we need to check if n=3183 gives x just above 0.0001. Wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.00003) \u2248 0.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's actually outside the interval. Wait, that's a problem. So, my initial calculation included n=3183, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's not in the interval. Therefore, I need to find the maximum n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n\u03c0 < 10000 => n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, the maximum integer n is 3183, but we need to check if x=1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0): \u03c0 \u2248 3.1415926535, so 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 10000.00003. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099999, which is less than 0.0001. Therefore, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u22480.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not in the interval. Therefore, the maximum n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3182. Let me check n=3182: 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 10000 - 0.00003, so 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. Similarly, the minimum n is 319. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 +1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 +1=2864. So, there are 2864 integers. Wait, but earlier I thought n goes up to 3183, but since n=3183 gives x below 0.0001, it's excluded. So, the correct upper bound is n=3182. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Let me confirm this again. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001). So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, for x=1/(n\u03c0), we have 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let's solve for n. From 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001: n\u03c0 < 10000 => n < 10000/\u03c0 \u22483183.0988618. So, n \u22643183. But since n must be integer, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, the maximum n is 3182. Similarly, from 1/(n\u03c0) <0.001: n\u03c0 >1000 =>n>1000/\u03c0\u2248318.3098862. So, n\u2265319. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Number of integers: 3182 -319 +1= 3182-319=2863; 2863+1=2864. Therefore, there are 2864 x-intercepts. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but now it's 2864. So, which one is correct? Let me do the math again. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b -a +1. So, a=319, b=3182. So, 3182 -319=2863; 2863+1=2864. Yes, that's correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Therefore, the final answer is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0).

Since n is an integer, the smallest possible n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers in this range, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check. Alternatively, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here a = 319, b = 3183. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 x-intercepts in that interval. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. So, x must be greater than 0.0001, which means 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, so n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988618, so n \u2264 3183.

Therefore, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me calculate that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, 2865 x-intercepts. Hmm, that seems like a lot, but considering the function oscillates rapidly as x approaches zero, it makes sense that there are many intercepts in that small interval. Let me just think about it another way. The interval from 0.0001 to 0.001 is from 10^{-4} to 10^{-3}. The function sin(1/x) has a period of 2\u03c0/(1/x) = 2\u03c0x, but as x approaches zero, the period becomes smaller, so the function oscillates more and more rapidly. So, in this interval, the number of oscillations is roughly proportional to the integral of 1/x over the interval, which is ln(0.001) - ln(0.0001) = ln(0.001/0.0001) = ln(10) \u2248 2.302585093. But wait, that might not directly give the number of zeros. Alternatively, the number of zeros is approximately the change in (1/x) divided by \u03c0, because each zero occurs every \u03c0 in the argument of sine. So, the change in (1/x) from x=0.001 to x=0.0001 is 1/0.0001 - 1/0.001 = 10000 - 1000 = 9000. So, the number of zeros would be approximately 9000 / \u03c0 \u2248 2866.197. Hmm, that's close to 2865, which matches our earlier calculation.

Since n must be an integer, n must be greater than 318.309... and less than 3183.098... So, n starts from the next integer after 318.309..., which is 319, and goes up to the integer just below 3183.098..., which is 3183. So, n can be 319, 320, 321, ..., 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is given by b - a + 1. So, substituting a = 319 and b = 3183: Number of x-intercepts = 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, let me double-check that subtraction. 3183 - 319 is 2864, then adding 1 gives 2865. Yeah, that seems right. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. So, x must be greater than 0.0001, which translates to n < 3183.098..., so n can be up to 3183. And x must be less than 0.001, which translates to n > 318.309..., so n starts at 319. So, the integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To count them: 3183 - 319 + 1.

So, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) for the function y = sin(1/x). I think that makes sense because as x approaches zero, 1/x becomes very large, and sin(1/x) oscillates rapidly. Between 0.0001 and 0.001, the function will cross the x-axis many times, each time corresponding to a zero of the sine function at a different multiple of \u03c0. So, the number of intercepts is proportional to the difference in the values of 1/(n\u03c0) as n increases. Therefore, the calculation seems solid.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, leading to x = 1/(n\u03c0).

The number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then 2864 + 1 is 2865. Yes, that seems correct.

Dividing all parts by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098. Since n is an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, 2865 x-intercepts. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, I remember that near x = 0, the function sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times, but in this interval, it's between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a finite interval, so the number of zeros should be finite, which it is. Let me also think about the behavior of the function. As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates between -1 and 1 more and more rapidly. So, in the interval from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is from 10^-4 to 10^-3, the function sin(1/x) will cross the x-axis every time 1/x increases by \u03c0, which corresponds to x decreasing by approximately \u03c0/(x^2) or something like that. But I think my initial approach is correct: each zero occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0), so counting the number of n's between 319 and 3183 gives the number of zeros. So, 2865 seems to be the answer. I think that's it.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. To find the number of such x in (0.0001, 0.001), we solve for n:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001  \n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000  \n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.10\n\nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

Now, let's look at the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) Calculating the right side: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.309 So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309. Since n is an integer, the smallest possible n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to count how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers, inclusive, we subtract the smaller from the larger and add 1. So, number of integers = 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. Hmm, 3183 minus 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Yes, that's correct. So, adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me think again. Is each n in that range corresponding to a unique x in the interval? Let me confirm that. For each integer n from 319 to 3183, x = 1/(n\u03c0) will be in (0.0001, 0.001). Let me check for n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.32) \u2248 0.0009967, which is just below 0.001, so it's within the interval. For n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0009) \u2248 0.00009999, which is just above 0.0001, so it's also within the interval. So, all these x's are indeed within (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the total number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's correct. But let me check if I considered all possible cases. Since the function sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0, but in the given interval, we're only considering x between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a small range near zero. Each oscillation corresponds to a zero crossing at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, each n in that range corresponds to exactly one x-intercept. Therefore, the count is indeed 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for each integer n. To find how many such x lie in (0.0001, 0.001), we solve for n:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nThis gives n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. Thus, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) Calculating that: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.309. So, n > approximately 318.309. Since n must be an integer, the minimum possible value for n is 319. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. To find the number of integers from a to b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the numbers: 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n, each corresponding to an x-intercept in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a lot of intercepts. So, 1/(n\u03c0) needs to be between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, n must be between 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2865. That seems correct. So, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me think about the behavior of the function. As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. The interval (0.0001, 0.001) is very close to zero, so the function is oscillating very rapidly, which means it crosses the x-axis many times. Each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the sine function completes a half-period, so each x-intercept corresponds to an increment of \u03c0 in 1/x. Therefore, the number of intercepts is proportional to the change in 1/x over the interval divided by \u03c0. Let's compute that: 1/0.0001 = 10000, and 1/0.001 = 1000. The difference is 10000 - 1000 = 9000. So, the change in 1/x is 9000. Each \u03c0 interval gives one x-intercept, so the number of intercepts is approximately 9000 / \u03c0 \u2248 2866. But wait, that's a bit different from 2865. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Wait, 9000 / \u03c0 is approximately 9000 / 3.1416 \u2248 2866.198. So, that would suggest 2866 intercepts. But my earlier calculation using n from 319 to 3183 gave 2865. So, there's a discrepancy here. Let me check where I went wrong. Wait, when I calculated n, I had n > 318.309 and n < 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of n's is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. But according to the change in 1/x being 9000, the number of intercepts should be 9000 / \u03c0 \u2248 2866. So, which one is correct? Let me think about it. The exact number is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000 / \u03c0 < n < 10000 / \u03c0. So, n must be greater than 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and less than 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that's precise. The approximation using 9000 / \u03c0 is slightly off because 10000 - 1000 = 9000, but when you divide by \u03c0, you get the number of \u03c0 intervals, which should correspond to the number of zeros. But since 1/x is continuous, the number of zeros is the floor of 10000 / \u03c0 minus the ceiling of 1000 / \u03c0. So, floor(10000 / \u03c0) = 3183, and ceiling(1000 / \u03c0) = 319. So, the number of zeros is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Therefore, the correct number is 2865. The discrepancy comes from the fact that 9000 / \u03c0 is an approximation, but the exact count is 2865. So, I think my initial calculation was correct.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), x ranges from 1/10000 to 1/1000. Thus, n ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 x-intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

    "text": " 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) = 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618 So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n is an integer, n \u2264 3183. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) < n Calculating 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.3098862 So, n must be greater than approximately 318.3098862. Since n is an integer, n \u2265 319. So, combining both inequalities, n must be an integer such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check. When I computed 1/(0.0001\u03c0), I got approximately 3183.0988618, so n must be less than that, so the maximum integer n is 3183. Similarly, 1/(0.001\u03c0) is approximately 318.3098862, so the minimum integer n is 319. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, yes, 2865 x-intercepts. Wait, but I should make sure that x = 1/(n\u03c0) actually lies within (0.0001, 0.001) for each n from 319 to 3183. Let me check for n=319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.13) \u2248 0.0009968, which is greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. For n=3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.001) \u2248 0.000099999, which is just below 0.0001, but wait, the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.000099999 is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Wait, that's a problem. Because when n=3183, x is just below 0.0001, so it's not in the interval. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. The upper limit is 0.001, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009968, which is less than 0.001 and greater than 0.0001, so it's included. For n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, the maximum n for which x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is when 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n can be up to 3183, but when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000099999 < 0.0001, which is not included. So, the maximum n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3183, but wait, no. Because 1/(3183\u03c0) \u22480.000099999 is less than 0.0001, so n must be less than 3183.0988618, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but when n=3183, x is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22481/(10000 - \u03c0)\u22481/10000\u22480.0001, but let me compute it more accurately. Let me compute 3182\u03c0: \u03c0\u22483.1415926535, so 3182*3.1415926535\u22483182*3.1415926535. Let's compute 3000\u03c0\u22489424.77796, 182\u03c0\u2248572.0023, so total\u22489424.77796 + 572.0023\u224810,000. So, 3182\u03c0\u224810,000. Therefore, 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.0001. But since 3182\u03c0 is slightly less than 10,000, because 3182*\u03c0\u22483182*3.1415926535\u224810,000 - a small amount, so 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.0001 + a tiny bit. So, 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.000100000... something, which is just above 0.0001. So, n=3182 would give x\u22480.000100000..., which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because n=3183 gives x\u22480.000099999, which is below 0.0001 and thus excluded. So, now, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, there are 2864 x-intercepts. Wait, but earlier I thought n went up to 3183, but now I'm adjusting because n=3183 gives x below 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, n must be from 319 to 3182 inclusive, giving 2864 intercepts. Let me confirm this with another approach. The interval for x is (0.0001, 0.001). Let me take the reciprocal of these bounds to find the corresponding \u03b8 values. So, when x=0.001, \u03b8=1/x=1000. When x=0.0001, \u03b8=1/x=10,000. So, \u03b8 ranges from 1000 to 10,000. Now, sin(\u03b8)=0 when \u03b8=n\u03c0, so we need to count the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10,000. So, find the smallest integer n such that n\u03c0 \u2265 1000, and the largest integer n such that n\u03c0 \u2264 10,000. The smallest n is the ceiling of 1000/\u03c0. Let me compute 1000/\u03c0\u2248318.3098862, so the smallest integer n is 319. The largest n is the floor of 10,000/\u03c0\u22483183.0988618, so the largest integer n is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but earlier I thought n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000099999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. But according to this reciprocal approach, \u03b8=10,000 corresponds to x=0.0001, so \u03b8=10,000 is the upper limit for \u03b8. So, n\u03c0 \u226410,000. So, n \u226410,000/\u03c0\u22483183.0988618, so n=3183 is allowed because 3183\u03c0\u224810,000 - a small amount. Wait, but 3183\u03c0\u224810,000 - let's compute 3183*\u03c0: 3183*3.1415926535\u22483183*3.1415926535. Let me compute 3000\u03c0\u22489424.77796, 183\u03c0\u2248574.9999, so total\u22489424.77796 + 574.9999\u22489999.77786, which is less than 10,000. So, 3183\u03c0\u22489999.77786, which is less than 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22481/9999.77786\u22480.0001000022, which is just above 0.0001, so x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001000022, which is in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n=3183 is included because x\u22480.0001000022 >0.0001. Therefore, the number of n's is from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Wait, but earlier I thought that n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001000022, which is in the interval, so it should be included. So, why did I think earlier that n=3183 gives x below 0.0001? I must have miscalculated. Let me check 3183\u03c0: 3183*3.1415926535. Let me compute it more accurately.\n\nCompute 3183 * \u03c0:\n\nFirst, 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796\n\nThen, 183\u03c0 \u2248 574.9999 (since 183*3.1415926535\u2248574.9999)\n\nAdding them: 9424.77796 + 574.9999 \u2248 9999.77786\n\nSo, 3183\u03c0 \u22489999.77786, which is less than 10,000.\n\nTherefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u22481/9999.77786\u22480.0001000022\n\nWhich is approximately 0.0001000022, which is just above 0.0001, so x=1/(3183\u03c0) is indeed in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 is included.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 +1.\n\nCompute 3183 - 319:\n\n3183 - 300 = 2883\n\n2883 - 19 = 2864\n\nThen, 2864 +1=2865.\n\nTherefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001000022, which is in the interval, so it's included. So, the count is 2865.\n\nBut earlier, when I took the reciprocal approach, I thought that \u03b8=10,000 corresponds to x=0.0001, so \u03b8=10,000 is the upper limit, so n\u03c0 must be \u226410,000, which allows n=3183 because 3183\u03c0\u22489999.77786 <10,000.\n\nTherefore, the correct count is 2865.\n\nBut wait, let me check with n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001000022, which is in (0.0001, 0.001). So, it's included.\n\nSimilarly, n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009968, which is less than 0.001 and greater than 0.0001, so included.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that 3183\u03c0\u22489999.77786, which is less than 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001000022, which is just above 0.0001, so included.\n\nTherefore, the count is 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that 3183\u03c0\u224810,000, but actually, it's slightly less, so 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001000022, which is in the interval.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that n=3183 is included. Since 3183\u03c0\u22489999.77786 <10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001000022 >0.0001, so it's included.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed 1/(n\u03c0) for n=3183, I thought it was below 0.0001, but that was a miscalculation. The correct value is just above 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nTherefore, the correct count is 2865.\n\nSo, the final answer is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001). The x-intercepts occur at x=1/(n\u03c0), where n is integer. We need x >0.0001 and x <0.001.\n\nSo, 0.0001 <1/(n\u03c0) <0.001\n\nWhich implies:\n\n1/0.001 <n\u03c0 <1/0.0001\n\nWhich is 1000 <n\u03c0 <10,000\n\nDivide by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 <n <10,000/\u03c0\n\nCompute:\n\n1000/\u03c0\u2248318.3098862\n\n10,000/\u03c0\u22483183.0988618\n\nSo, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nNumber of integers: 3183 -319 +1=2865.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).
