    "text": " 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) = 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618 So, n < approximately 3183.0988618. Since n has to be an integer, the maximum n can be is 3183. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618 So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618. Since n has to be an integer, the smallest n can be is 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. Now, to find how many integers are in this range, we can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, number of integers = 3183 - 319 + 1 Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then adding 1 gives 2865. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check the calculations. 3183 minus 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, so 2865 x-intercepts. That seems like a lot, but considering the function oscillates rapidly as x approaches 0, especially in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is very close to zero, the number of oscillations could indeed be large. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the inequalities. So, x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, so 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. So, 1/x is between 1000 and 10000. Now, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000. Therefore, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, dividing all parts by \u03c0, we get 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, leading to x = 1/(n\u03c0). For x in (0.0001, 0.001), 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. Thus, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, giving n from 319 to 3183. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

    "text": " 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) is the same as 10000/\u03c0. Since \u03c0 is approximately 3.14159, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098861. So, n < 3183.098861. Similarly, for the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) Which is 1000/\u03c0. Again, using \u03c0 \u2248 3.14159, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098862. So, n > 318.3098862. Since n has to be an integer, n must be greater than 318.3098862, so the smallest integer n can be is 319. Similarly, n must be less than 3183.098861, so the largest integer n can be is 3183. Now, to find how many integers are between 319 and 3183, inclusive. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the values: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. So, 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more, which is 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, but let me think about this again. The x-intercepts are at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for n from 319 to 3183. So, each n in that range gives a distinct x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, the number of x-intercepts should be equal to the number of integers n between 319 and 3183, inclusive. So, 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, that would be 2865 x-intercepts. But wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check if I did the inequalities correctly. So, x is between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, 0.0001 < x < 0.001. x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me solve for n in both inequalities. Starting with 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 0.0001 * n\u03c0 < 1. So, n < 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098861. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.098861, so the maximum integer n is 3183. Now, the other inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0. So, n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098862. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.3098862, so the smallest integer n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, 2865 x-intercepts. Hmm, but wait, I feel like that's correct, but let me think about the behavior of the function. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0, because 1/x becomes very large. So, as x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x goes to infinity, and sin(1/x) oscillates between -1 and 1 infinitely many times. However, in our case, we're only looking between x = 0.0001 and x = 0.001. So, 1/x in this interval goes from 1000 to 10000. So, \u03b8 = 1/x varies from 1000 to 10000 radians. Now, each time \u03b8 increases by \u03c0, sin(\u03b8) completes a half-period, so it crosses zero every \u03c0 radians. So, the number of zeros between \u03b8 = a and \u03b8 = b is roughly (b - a)/\u03c0. Let's compute that: (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 = 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.198. Hmm, that's close to 2865, which is what I got earlier. The slight difference is because 9000/\u03c0 is approximately 2866.198, but since n must be integers, we take the floor of the upper bound and the ceiling of the lower bound, which gives us 2865. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me check again: if \u03b8 goes from 1000 to 10000, the number of zeros is the number of times \u03b8 crosses a multiple of \u03c0 in that interval. So, the number of zeros is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0) + 1. Let me compute ceil(1000/\u03c0) and floor(10000/\u03c0). 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098862, so ceil(1000/\u03c0) = 319. 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098861, so floor(10000/\u03c0) = 3183. So, the number of zeros is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that matches. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts at x = 1/(n\u03c0) where n is an integer. To find the number of these intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), we solve for n:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001  \n=> 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183\n\nThe number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

Since n must be an integer, n \u2264 3183.\n\nNow, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) < n Calculating that: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.3098 So, n > approximately 318.3098. Since n must be an integer, n \u2265 319.\n\nSo, putting it together, n must satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers inclusive, we subtract the smaller from the larger and add 1. So, number of integers = 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 = 2864; 2864 + 1 = 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 integer values of n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 1/(0.0001\u03c0) is indeed 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 3183.0988, so n must be less than that, so n \u2264 3183. Then, 1/(0.001\u03c0) is 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098, so n must be greater than that, so n \u2265 319. So, the number of integers is from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 is 2865. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me check if 1/(319\u03c0) is indeed greater than 0.001. Let's compute 1/(319 * \u03c0). 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 1002. So, 1/1002 \u2248 0.000998, which is just under 0.001, but wait, that's less than 0.001, which would mean that x = 1/(319\u03c0) is approximately 0.000998, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but I thought n must be greater than 318.3098, so n \u2265 319, which would give x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000998, which is indeed less than 0.001, so it's included. Similarly, n = 318 would give x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.008) \u2248 0.000999992, which is just under 0.001, but wait, 318\u03c0 \u2248 318*3.1416 \u2248 1000.008, so 1/(1000.008) \u2248 0.000999992, which is indeed less than 0.001, so x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999992 is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Wait, but earlier I thought n must be greater than 318.3098, so n \u2265 319. But 318\u03c0 \u2248 1000.008, which is just over 1000, so 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999992, which is less than 0.001, so x = 1/(318\u03c0) is in the interval. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the lower bound.\n\nWait, let me recast the inequalities. The lower bound is x > 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988, so n \u2264 3183.\n\nThe upper bound is x < 0.001, so 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which implies n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.3098, so n \u2265 319.\n\nBut when n = 318, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999992, which is less than 0.001, so x = 1/(318\u03c0) is within the interval. So, does that mean n can be 318? Wait, but 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999992 < 0.001, so yes, it's included. So, perhaps I should include n = 318 as well. So, the lower bound for n is 319? Or is it 318?\n\nWait, let me check: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.3098, so n must be greater than 318.3098, so the smallest integer n is 319. Therefore, n starts at 319. So, n = 319, 320, ..., 3183.\n\nSo, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but when n = 318, x = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999992, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. But according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.3098, so n = 319 is the first integer. So, n = 318 would give x \u2248 0.000999992, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval. Therefore, perhaps my initial calculation was wrong because I excluded n = 318.\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\nWe have x = 1/(n\u03c0) must satisfy 0.0001 < x < 0.001.\n\nSo, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nLet's solve for n in each inequality.\n\nFirst inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 > 0.0001 * n\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by 0.0001\u03c0: 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) > n\n\nWhich is n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988, so n \u2264 3183.\n\nSecond inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by 0.001\u03c0: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) < n\n\nWhich is n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098, so n \u2265 319.\n\nTherefore, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that: 3183 - 319 = 2864; 2864 + 1 = 2865.\n\nSo, that's correct. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183, inclusive, giving 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that n=318 would give x \u2248 0.000999992, which is less than 0.001, so why isn't n=318 included?\n\nBecause when we solve 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, we get n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098, so n must be greater than 318.3098, so the smallest integer n is 319. So, n=318 would give x \u2248 0.000999992, which is less than 0.001, but does it satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001? Let's compute 1/(318\u03c0):\n\n318\u03c0 \u2248 318 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 1000.0076. So, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999992, which is indeed less than 0.001. So, that x is in the interval. But according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.3098, so n=318 is less than that, so it's not included. Wait, that seems contradictory.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inequality direction. Let's go back.\n\nWe have 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0\n\nThen, divide both sides by 0.001\u03c0: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) < n\n\nWhich is n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098.\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.3098, so the smallest integer n is 319.\n\nBut when n=318, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999992 < 0.001, so it's included in the interval. So, why isn't n=318 included in the solution?\n\nWait, perhaps because when we solve 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, we get n > 1000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.3098. So, n must be greater than that, so n=319 is the first integer. But n=318 is less than 318.3098, so it doesn't satisfy n > 318.3098, so n=318 is excluded.\n\nBut wait, when n=318, 1/(n\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999992, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, why is it excluded?\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is arising because the inequality is strict. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. So, let's check if x=1/(318\u03c0) is less than 0.001.\n\n1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999992, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. But according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.3098, so n=318 is less than that, so it's excluded. Therefore, x=1/(318\u03c0) is not in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), because 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999992, which is less than 0.001, but wait, 0.000999992 is less than 0.001, so it's included. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, no, 0.000999992 is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, why is n=318 excluded?\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that when we derived n > 318.3098, we're saying that n must be greater than that value to satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. But n=318 is less than 318.3098, so 1/(318\u03c0) would be greater than 0.001. Wait, but that's not the case because 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999992 < 0.001.\n\nWait, perhaps my initial inequality solving was wrong. Let's re-examine:\n\nWe have 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0.\n\nThen, divide both sides by 0.001\u03c0: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) < n.\n\nSo, n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098.\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.3098, so n=319 is the first integer. Therefore, n=318 is less than 318.3098, so it doesn't satisfy n > 318.3098, so x=1/(318\u03c0) is not less than 0.001, but in reality, it is less. So, perhaps my inequality is incorrect.\n\nWait, no, if n=318, then 1/(n\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999992 < 0.001, so it does satisfy the inequality. Therefore, perhaps my earlier conclusion that n must be greater than 318.3098 is incorrect.\n\nWait, let's re-express the inequality:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by 0.001: 1000 < n\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n\n\nSo, n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098.\n\nTherefore, n must be greater than 318.3098, so n=319 is the first integer. Therefore, n=318 is less than 318.3098, so 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999992 < 0.001, which is true, so why isn't n=318 included?\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is that when n=318, 1/(n\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999992 < 0.001, so it's included, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.3098, so n=318 is not included. Therefore, perhaps the initial inequality is wrong because when n=318, 1/(n\u03c0) is less than 0.001, which is within the interval, so n=318 should be included.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the inequality. Let's go back.\n\nWe have 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0\n\nThen, divide both sides by 0.001: 1000 < n\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n\n\nSo, n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.3098, so n=319 is the first integer. Therefore, n=318 is excluded.\n\nBut when n=318, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.000999992 < 0.001, so it's included in the interval. So, there's a contradiction here.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that when n=318, 1/(n\u03c0) is approximately 0.000999992, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=318 should be included in the count.\n\nBut according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.3098, so n=318 is less than that, so it's excluded. Therefore, perhaps my initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001, so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nSo, for n, we have:\n\n1/(0.001) < n\u03c0 < 1/(0.0001)\n\nWhich is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDivide all parts by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nSo, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988\n\nTherefore, n must be integers greater than 318.3098 and less than 3183.0988.\n\nTherefore, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest is 3183.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nTherefore, n=318 is excluded because 318 < 318.3098, so x=1/(318\u03c0) is \u22480.000999992, which is less than 0.001, but since n=318 is less than 318.3098, it's excluded. Therefore, the count starts at n=319.\n\nBut wait, when n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0) \u22480.000999992 is less than 0.001, so it's in the interval. So, why is n=318 excluded?\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is that when n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0) \u22480.000999992, which is less than 0.001, so it's included, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.3098, so n=318 is excluded, which would mean x=1/(318\u03c0) is excluded. But that's not correct because x=0.000999992 is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the inequality direction. Let me check:\n\nWe have x = 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nSo, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nWhich implies n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.3098\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.3098, so n=319 is the first integer.\n\nBut when n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0) \u22480.000999992 < 0.001, so it's included in the interval. Therefore, perhaps the inequality is correct, but n=318 is less than 318.3098, so it's excluded, but x=1/(318\u03c0) is still less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval. Therefore, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001, so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nSo, taking reciprocals (and reversing inequalities because reciprocals reverse inequality signs for positive numbers):\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDivide by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nSo, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248318.3098 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u22483183.0988.\n\nTherefore, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nSo, even though x=1/(318\u03c0) is less than 0.001, n=318 is less than 318.3098, so it's excluded, which means x=1/(318\u03c0) is not in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but 1/(318\u03c0) \u22480.000999992 is less than 0.001, so it's included. Therefore, perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is arising because when we take reciprocals, we have to consider the direction of the inequalities correctly.\n\nGiven 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nTaking reciprocals:\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDivide by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248318.3098 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u22483183.0988\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.3098 and less than 3183.0988.\n\nTherefore, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183, inclusive.\n\nSo, n=318 is less than 318.3098, so it's excluded, even though 1/(318\u03c0) is less than 0.001, because x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001, but in this case, 1/(318\u03c0) is approximately 0.000999992, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, perhaps my approach is wrong because n=318 is excluded, but x=1/(318\u03c0) is included in the interval.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if 1/(318\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001.\n\n1/(318\u03c0) \u22480.000999992, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. Therefore, n=318 should be included, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.3098, so n=318 is excluded. Therefore, perhaps my initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is that when I take reciprocals, I should reverse the inequalities, but I have to make sure that I'm considering the correct direction.\n\nGiven 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nTaking reciprocals (since all terms are positive), we get:\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDivide by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nSo, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248318.3098 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u22483183.0988.\n\nTherefore, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, n=318 is excluded, even though x=1/(318\u03c0) is in the interval, because n must be greater than 318.3098.\n\nWait, but that seems contradictory because n=318 gives x=1/(318\u03c0) \u22480.000999992, which is less than 0.001 and greater than 0.0001, so it's in the interval. Therefore, perhaps the initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is that when we take reciprocals, we have to reverse the inequalities, but we also have to consider that n must satisfy both 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nSo, let's write both inequalities:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u22483183.0988\n\n1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248318.3098\n\nTherefore, n must satisfy 318.3098 < n < 3183.0988\n\nTherefore, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nTherefore, even though x=1/(318\u03c0) is in the interval, n=318 is not in the range because n must be greater than 318.3098, so n=319 is the first integer. Therefore, the count is 2865.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\). This occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for some integer \\( n \\), which implies \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n\nWe need \\( x \\) to satisfy \\( 0.0001 < x < 0.001 \\). Substituting \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\), we get the inequalities:\n\\[ 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\]\n\nRewriting these inequalities:\n1. \\( \\frac{1}{n\\pi} > 0.0001 \\) implies \\( n < \\frac{1}{0.0001\\pi} \\approx 3183.0988 \\)\n2. \\( \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\) implies \\( n > \\frac{1}{0.001\\pi} \\approx 318.3098 \\)\n\nThus, \\( n \\) must be an integer such that:\n\\[ 318.3098 < n < 3183.0988 \\]\n\nThe smallest integer \\( n \\) is 319, and the largest integer \\( n \\) is 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is calculated as:\n\\[ 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts is \\(\\boxed{2865}\\)."

    "text": " 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) is the same as 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n < approximately 3183.0988618. Since n has to be an integer, n must be less than or equal to 3183. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) 1 / (0.001\u03c0) is 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618. Since n is an integer, n must be at least 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Wait, let me check that again. If n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, add 1: 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n that satisfy 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Each of these n corresponds to an x-intercept in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the range of n. Let me double-check the inequalities. Starting with x = 1/(n\u03c0) in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and remembering that flipping inequalities when taking reciprocals because all terms are positive), we get 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Then, dividing all parts by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, so n must be greater than 318.30988618, so the smallest integer n is 319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618, so n must be less than 3183.0988618, so the largest integer n is 3183.

Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) Calculating that: 1 / 0.001 is 1000, so 1 / (0.001\u03c0) \u2248 1000/3.1416 \u2248 318.309. Since n must be an integer, the minimum possible n is 319. So, n must be an integer from 319 up to 3183. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, let me check that again. Wait, 3183 - 319 is 2864, so adding 1 gives 2865. But wait, is that correct? Let me see: from 1 to N, there are N numbers. So, from 319 to 3183, it's 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more to get 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. Let me double-check the substitution. When x is in (0.0001, 0.001), then 1/x is in (1000, 10000). So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. Now, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so n\u03c0 must be between 1000 and 10000. Therefore, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, which gives n > 1000/\u03c0 and n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n must be less than 3183.098, so the largest integer n is 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but just to be thorough, let me check if n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0) which is approximately 1/(1003.13) \u2248 0.0009969, which is greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. Similarly, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.00) \u2248 0.0001, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), we need to check if 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Let's compute 3183\u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 10000.00, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since the interval is open at 0.0001, we need to check if 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but let's compute it more accurately. Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0: 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let me compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.777, 183\u03c0 \u2248 574.643, so total is approximately 9424.777 + 574.643 = 9999.42. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.42 \u2248 0.0001000058, which is just slightly above 0.0001. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001000058, which is indeed greater than 0.0001. Therefore, x=1/(3183\u03c0) is within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.0009969, which is less than 0.001. So, both endpoints are included.

So, there are 2865 integers in that range. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I found that x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0). Then, I set up the inequalities 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n, I correctly inverted the inequalities by taking reciprocals and adjusting the inequality signs, which changes the direction when taking reciprocals.

    "text": " 1 / 0.0001 is 10000, so 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n < approximately 3183.0988618. Since n must be an integer, the maximum possible n is 3183. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) 1 / 0.001 is 1000, so 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.3098862. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.3098862. Since n must be an integer, the smallest possible n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both ends are inclusive). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recalculate 3183 - 319. 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then minus 19 more is 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should check if n starts at 319 or 318. Wait, because when I calculated n > 318.3098862, so n must be at least 319. So that part is correct. Similarly, n < 3183.0988618, so n can be up to 3183. So, yes, n runs from 319 to 3183, which gives 2865 values. Hmm, but wait, let me check if 1/(n\u03c0) is indeed within (0.0001, 0.001) for n = 319 and n = 3183. For n = 319: 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.328) \u2248 0.0009967, which is less than 0.001 and greater than 0.0001. For n = 3183: 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.000003) \u2248 0.0001, but wait, 0.0001 is the lower bound, but the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, does 1/(3183\u03c0) equal exactly 0.0001? Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0). Since 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but exactly, it's slightly more than 0.0001 because 3183 * \u03c0 is slightly more than 10000. Wait, 3183 * 3.1415926535 is exactly 3183 * \u03c0, which is approximately 10000.000003, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0000999997, which is just below 0.0001. So, 0.0000999997 < 0.0001, which is the lower bound of the interval, which is open. So, x must be greater than 0.0001, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, n cannot be 3183 because that would give x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999997, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) would be greater than 0.0001. Let me check that: 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, and 182 * \u03c0 \u2248 571.5828. So, 9424.77796 + 571.5828 \u2248 10,000.36076. So, 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 10,000.36076, so 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999964, which is still less than 0.0001. Hmm, that's still below 0.0001. So, maybe I need to find the smallest n where 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. Let's solve for n in 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than 3183.0988618, so the maximum integer n is 3183. But as we saw, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999997, which is less than 0.0001. So, perhaps n needs to be less than or equal to 3182? Wait, no, because 1/(3182\u03c0) is even smaller. Wait, I'm getting confused. Wait, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0). So, n must be less than 3183.0988618, so the maximum integer n is 3183. But when n=3183, 1/(n\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999997, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not in the interval. So, the maximum n where 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3183? Wait, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it doesn't satisfy the inequality. So, perhaps the maximum n is 3182? Let me check 1/(3182\u03c0). As I calculated before, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 10,000.36076, so 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999964, which is still less than 0.0001. Hmm, so maybe I need to go lower. Let's try n=318, let's compute 1/(318\u03c0). 318\u03c0 \u2248 318 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 1000.000003. So, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009967, which is greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001, so that's good. Similarly, n=319: 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.328) \u2248 0.0009967, which is still within the interval. Wait, but earlier when I calculated n=319, I thought it was 0.0009967, which is less than 0.001, so that's fine. But for the lower bound, I need x > 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, solving for n: n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n can be up to 3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999997, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182? Wait, but 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999964, which is still less than 0.0001. So, perhaps I need to find the smallest n where 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. Let's solve for n: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988618. So, the maximum integer n is 3183, but as we saw, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999997 < 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, but 1/(3182\u03c0) is also less than 0.0001. Wait, this seems like a problem. Maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me think differently. The interval is x \u2208 (0.0001, 0.001). So, 0.0001 < x < 0.001. We have x = 1/(n\u03c0), so substituting, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let's solve for n in each inequality. First inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Multiply both sides by n\u03c0: 0.0001 * n\u03c0 < 1. Then, n < 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618, so the maximum integer n is 3183. But as we saw, n=3183 gives x\u22480.0000999997, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, the maximum n is 3182? Wait, but let's compute 1/(3182\u03c0). 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 10,000.36076. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999964, which is still less than 0.0001. Hmm, so even n=3182 gives x less than 0.0001. So, perhaps I need to find the smallest n such that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. Let's set up the inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than 3183.0988618, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but as we saw, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999997 < 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, but 1/(3182\u03c0) is still less than 0.0001. So, perhaps the maximum n is lower. Let me try n=318: 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.000003) \u2248 0.0009967, which is greater than 0.0001. So, n=318 gives x\u22480.0009967, which is within the interval. Similarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.0009967 as well? Wait, no, n=319 would be 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.328) \u2248 0.0009967, which is still within the interval. Wait, but as n increases, x decreases. So, the smallest x in the interval is 0.0001, so we need the largest n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, solving for n: n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n can be up to 3183, but as we saw, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999997 < 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, but 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999964 < 0.0001, so still excluded. Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let me find the range of n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let's solve for n in both inequalities.\n\nFirst inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988618.\n\nSecond inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.3098862.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 318.3098862 < n < 3183.0988618.\n\nSince n must be an integer, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nWait, but earlier I saw that n=3183 gives x\u22480.0000999997 < 0.0001, which is excluded. So, perhaps the upper limit is n=3182? Let me check.\n\nIf n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0000999997 < 0.0001: excluded.\n\nn=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.0000999964 < 0.0001: excluded.\n\nn=3181: x=1/(3181\u03c0)\u22480.0001000003 > 0.0001: included.\n\nSo, n=3181 gives x\u22480.0001000003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval.\n\nSimilarly, n=3180: x=1/(3180\u03c0)\u22480.0001000010 > 0.0001: included.\n\nWait, so perhaps the maximum n is 3181, because n=3181 gives x\u22480.0001000003, which is just above 0.0001.\n\nSimilarly, n=3182: x\u22480.0000999964 < 0.0001: excluded.\n\nSo, the maximum n is 3181.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n could go up to 3183, but that gives x below 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3181.\n\nSimilarly, the minimum n is 319, as 319 gives x\u22480.0009967 < 0.001, which is within the interval.\n\nWait, no, 0.0009967 is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nWait, 0.0009967 is approximately 0.0009967, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval.\n\nWait, but 0.0009967 is greater than 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nWait, but let me check n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22481/(1003.328)\u22480.0009967, which is within (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nSimilarly, n=318: x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22481/(1000.000003)\u22480.0009967, which is also within the interval.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n=318 gives x\u22480.0009967, which is within the interval, but when I computed n=3183, it was below 0.0001, so excluded.\n\nSo, to summarize, n must be greater than 318.3098862, so n starts at 319, and less than 3183.0988618, so n goes up to 3183, but n=3183 gives x\u22480.0000999997, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, but n=3182 gives x\u22480.0000999964, which is still less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3181, which gives x\u22480.0001000003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nSo, now, the range of n is from 319 to 3181 inclusive.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n could go up to 3183, but since n=3183 is excluded, the maximum n is 3181.\n\nWait, let me verify this with exact calculations.\n\nLet me compute 1/(3181\u03c0):\n\n3181 * \u03c0 \u2248 3181 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 ?\n\nLet me compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796\n\n181\u03c0 \u2248 568.1432\n\nSo, 9424.77796 + 568.1432 \u2248 10,000.92116\n\nSo, 1/(3181\u03c0) \u2248 1/10,000.92116 \u2248 0.0000999908, which is less than 0.0001? Wait, that can't be right because 1/10,000.92116 is approximately 0.0000999908, which is less than 0.0001. Hmm, so that's still below 0.0001, so it's excluded.\n\nWait, so maybe n=3180:\n\n3180 * \u03c0 \u2248 3180 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 ?\n\n3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796\n\n180\u03c0 \u2248 565.4867\n\nSo, 9424.77796 + 565.4867 \u2248 9990.26466\n\nWait, that can't be right because 3180\u03c0 should be approximately 3180 * 3.1415926535.\n\nWait, 3180 * 3.1415926535:\n\n3000 * 3.1415926535 = 9424.77796\n\n180 * 3.1415926535 = 565.4867\n\nSo, total is 9424.77796 + 565.4867 \u2248 9990.26466\n\nSo, 1/(3180\u03c0) \u2248 1/9990.26466 \u2248 0.000100097, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nSimilarly, n=3180 gives x\u22480.000100097, which is just above 0.0001, so included.\n\nn=3179: 3179\u03c0 \u2248 3179 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 ?\n\n3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796\n\n179\u03c0 \u2248 562.3755\n\nSo, 9424.77796 + 562.3755 \u2248 9987.15346\n\n1/9987.15346 \u2248 0.000100127, which is greater than 0.0001.\n\nSimilarly, n=3178: 3178\u03c0 \u2248 3178 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 ?\n\n3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796\n\n178\u03c0 \u2248 559.3838\n\nTotal \u2248 9424.77796 + 559.3838 \u2248 9984.16176\n\n1/9984.16176 \u2248 0.000100163, which is greater than 0.0001.\n\nWait, so as n decreases, x increases.

So, the correct number is 2862.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let me compute the number of n's where n > 318.3098862 and n < 3183.0988618, but with the correction that n=3183 is excluded, so n goes up to 3180.\n\nSo, n starts at 319 and ends at 3180.\n\nNumber of terms: 3180 - 319 +1 = 2862.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 3180\u03c0 \u2248 9990.26466, so 1/(3180\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100097, which is just above 0.0001, so included.\n\nSimilarly, n=3181: 3181\u03c0 \u2248 10,000.92116, so 1/(3181\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999908 < 0.0001: excluded.\n\nTherefore, n=3180 is the maximum n.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2862.\n\nWait, but let me check this with another approach.\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has a period of 2\u03c0/(1/x) = 2\u03c0x, but that's not quite right because the period of sin(1/x) isn't constant. Instead, the zeros occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0), as we established earlier.\n\nSo, the number of zeros in the interval (a, b) is equal to the number of integers n such that a < 1/(n\u03c0) < b.\n\nWhich is equivalent to finding n such that 1/(b\u03c0) < n < 1/(a\u03c0).\n\nSo, in this case, a=0.0001, b=0.001.\n\nSo, 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.3098862 < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988618.\n\nSo, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nBut as we saw, n=3183 gives x\u22480.0000999997 < 0.0001: excluded.\n\nn=3182: x\u22480.0000999964 < 0.0001: excluded.\n\nn=3181: x\u22480.0000999908 < 0.0001: excluded.\n\nn=3180: x\u22480.000100097 > 0.0001: included.\n\nSo, the number of integers n is from 319 to 3180 inclusive.\n\nNumber of integers: 3180 - 319 +1 = 2862.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2862.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but that was before realizing that n=3183, 3182, and 3181 give x below 0.0001, so they're excluded. So, the correct number is 2862.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to see if my approach is correct.\n\nSuppose I have an interval (0.0002, 0.0003). How many x-intercepts would y = sin(1/x) have there?\n\nUsing the same method: x = 1/(n\u03c0).\n\nSo, 0.0002 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.0003.\n\nSolving for n:\n\n1/(0.0003\u03c0) \u2248 1030.928 < n < 1/(0.0002\u03c0) \u2248 1545.389.\n\nSo, n ranges from 1031 to 1545 inclusive.\n\nNumber of integers: 1545 - 1031 +1 = 515.\n\nWait, but let me compute 1545 - 1031 = 514, plus 1 is 515.\n\nBut let me check if n=1545 gives x=1/(1545\u03c0) \u2248 1/(4853.840) \u2248 0.0002056, which is greater than 0.0002, so included.\n\nn=1546: x=1/(1546\u03c0) \u2248 1/(4864.840) \u2248 0.0002052, which is still greater than 0.0002.\n\nWait, but 0.0002052 is greater than 0.0002, so included.\n\nWait, but in this case, the upper limit is 0.0003, so n must be less than 1/(0.0003\u03c0) \u2248 1030.928, so n=1031 is the minimum.\n\nWait, but in this example, the number of x-intercepts would be 515.\n\nBut wait, in reality, the function y = sin(1/x) oscillates more as x approaches 0, so in a small interval"

Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Similarly, multiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, divide both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.3098 So, n > approximately 318.3098. Since n must be an integer, n \u2265 319. So, combining both inequalities, n must be integers from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers between a and b inclusive is given by b - a + 1. So, plugging in the numbers: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 = 2864; 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. So, 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, that's correct. But let me think about whether all these n values actually give x within (0.0001, 0.001). Let me check for n=319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1004.33) \u2248 0.0009957, which is just under 0.001, so that's okay. For n=3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), we don't include 0.0001. So, actually, n=3183 gives x \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but since the interval is open, we should exclude it. Therefore, n should be less than 3183.0988, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but since x=1/(3183\u03c0) is equal to approximately 0.0001, which is not included in the interval, we need to take n up to 3182. Let me verify that: For n=3182: x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000 - \u03c0) \u2248 1/9997.06 \u2248 0.00010003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0) numerically. \u03c0 \u2248 3.1415926535, so 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let me compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, and 183\u03c0 \u2248 574.8456, so total \u2248 9424.77796 + 574.8456 \u2248 10000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. So, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), we don't include x=0.0001, so n=3183 is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Now, let's compute the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive. The formula is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 3182 - 319 = 2863; 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, there are 2864 integers. Therefore, there are 2864 x-intercepts. But wait, let me think again. Each n corresponds to a unique x-intercept, so each n from 319 to 3182 gives a distinct x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me check if I made any mistakes in the initial steps. I started by setting sin(1/x) = 0, which implies 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). Then, I substituted into the interval: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n, I got n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098, so n \u2265 319, and n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988, so n \u2264 3183. But since x=1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, which is excluded, n should go up to 3182. Therefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. Yes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. This gives x = 1/(n\u03c0). To find x in (0.0001, 0.001), we solve 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, leading to 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3182. The number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}."

    "text": " 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) = 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1416 \u2248 3183.098. So, n < approximately 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, the maximum possible value for n is 3183. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Similarly, multiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, divide both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.309. So, n > approximately 318.309. Since n must be an integer, the smallest possible value for n is 319. Therefore, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n in that range, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts in the given interval. Wait, but let me check if I did that correctly. Because 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute it as 3183 - 318 = 2865. Hmm, because 319 is 318 + 1, so subtracting 318 from 3183 gives 2865. Yeah, that works too. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me make sure that the endpoints are correctly handled. The interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. So, when I substituted, I had 0.0001 < x < 0.001, which translates to 1/(n\u03c0) being strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. So, n must be strictly less than 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183. Similarly, n must be strictly greater than 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309, so n starts at 319. Therefore, the endpoints are not included, which is consistent with the open interval. So, the count remains 2865. Wait, but let me check the exact values. Let me compute 1/(0.0001\u03c0) exactly. 0.0001 is 10^-4, so 1/(10^-4 * \u03c0) = 10^4 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than this, so the maximum integer n is 3183. Similarly, 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 10^3 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than this, so the smallest integer n is 319. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 gives 2865. So, 2865 x-intercepts. But wait, I'm a bit concerned because the function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0, so between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a very small interval near zero, it should have a lot of oscillations. So, 2865 seems plausible, but let me check if I made any miscalculations. Alternatively, maybe I can approach it differently. The x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, the number of x-intercepts between a and b is the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is between a and b. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > a => n < 1/(a\u03c0) and 1/(n\u03c0) < b => n > 1/(b\u03c0). So, n must satisfy 1/(b\u03c0) < n < 1/(a\u03c0). Since n must be an integer, the number of n's is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because n must be greater than 1/(b\u03c0) and less than 1/(a\u03c0). So, the number of integers n is floor(1/(a\u03c0) - 1) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) + 1. Hmm, maybe it's better to compute it as floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) + 1. Let me test with the numbers I have. So, 1/(a\u03c0) where a=0.0001 is 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so floor(10000/\u03c0) = 3183. 1/(b\u03c0) where b=0.001 is 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so ceil(1000/\u03c0) = 319. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that's consistent with my previous calculation. Therefore, I think 2865 is correct. But just to make sure, let me consider a smaller interval to test. Suppose I take the interval (0.0005, 0.0006). Then, 1/(0.0005\u03c0) = 2000/\u03c0 \u2248 636.619, and 1/(0.0006\u03c0) \u2248 1666.666/\u03c0 \u2248 530.516. So, n would range from 531 to 636. The number of integers is 636 - 531 + 1 = 106. Let me compute how many times sin(1/x) crosses zero between x=0.0005 and x=0.0006. Each x-intercept is at x=1/(n\u03c0). So, x=1/(531\u03c0) \u2248 0.000598, and x=1/(636\u03c0) \u2248 0.000498. Wait, but 0.000598 is greater than 0.0006, which is the upper bound of the interval. Hmm, that suggests that my method might be off. Wait, no, because 1/(n\u03c0) must be between 0.0005 and 0.0006, so n must satisfy 1/(0.0006\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0005\u03c0). Let me compute 1/(0.0006\u03c0) \u2248 1/(0.0006 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(0.00188496) \u2248 530.516. So, n must be greater than 530.516, so n=531. Similarly, 1/(0.0005\u03c0) \u2248 1/(0.0005 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(0.0015708) \u2248 636.619. So, n must be less than 636.619, so n=636. Therefore, n ranges from 531 to 636 inclusive. The number of integers is 636 - 531 + 1 = 106. But when I plug in n=531, x=1/(531\u03c0) \u2248 0.000598, which is less than 0.0006, so it's within the interval. Similarly, n=636, x=1/(636\u03c0) \u2248 0.000498, which is greater than 0.0005, so it's also within the interval. So, the count is correct. So, applying the same logic to the original problem, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.

    "text": " 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) is the same as 10000/\u03c0. Since \u03c0 is approximately 3.14159, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.14159 \u2248 3183.098. So, n < 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, n can be at most 3183. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) 1 / (0.001\u03c0) is 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.14159 \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309. Since n is an integer, the smallest n can be is 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a = 319 and b = 3183. So, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me calculate that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but let me double-check that subtraction. 3183 minus 319. Let's do it step by step: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. So, yes, 2864, then add 1: 2865. So, there are 2865 x-intercepts in that interval. But wait, let me think again. Is there a possibility that 1/(n\u03c0) could be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001? Because the interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), so we don't include the endpoints. So, we have to make sure that 1/(n\u03c0) is strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. So, n must satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which is exactly what we did. So, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check with another approach. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. The number of oscillations increases as x gets closer to 0. The interval (0.0001, 0.001) is from x = 0.0001 to x = 0.001. Let me consider the behavior of 1/x in this interval. When x = 0.001, 1/x = 1000. When x = 0.0001, 1/x = 10000. So, as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001, 1/x increases from 1000 to 10000. So, \u03b8 = 1/x goes from 1000 to 10000 radians. Now, sin(\u03b8) is zero at every multiple of \u03c0, so between \u03b8 = 1000 and \u03b8 = 10000, how many multiples of \u03c0 are there? The number of zeros would be the number of integers n such that n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing all parts by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Solving for x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) gives n ranging from 319 to 3183, resulting in 2865 x-intercepts.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

Since n is an integer, n \u2264 3183.\n\nNow, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184. Since n is an integer, n \u2265 319.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n that satisfy the condition. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me verify the calculations step by step. Starting with 1/(n\u03c0) between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, for the lower bound: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184, so n \u2264 3183. For the upper bound: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184, so n \u2265 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, then plus 1 is 2865. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about whether all these x-values are indeed within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). For n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.24) \u2248 0.0009977, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. For n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.03) \u2248 0.000099999, which is greater than 0.0001, so that's also within the interval. So, all the values from n=319 to n=3183 will produce x in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is indeed 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not missing any edge cases. For example, when n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.6) \u2248 0.0009994, which is still greater than 0.0001, but wait, that's actually greater than 0.001, right? Wait, no, 0.0009994 is less than 0.001, so it's still within the interval. Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, n must be greater than 318.309..., so n starts at 319. So, n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009994, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Hmm, so that suggests that n=318 would also be included, but my initial calculation said n > 318.309..., so n starts at 319. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake there.\n\nWait, let's recast the inequality. We have 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which is equivalent to n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184. Since n must be an integer, n must be at least 319. So, n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009994, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309886184, so n=318 is less than that, so it's not included. Hmm, that seems contradictory because when n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009994, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, perhaps my initial approach is missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the inequalities. Let me write them again:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nDividing all parts by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nCalculating these:\n\n1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184\n\n10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, n must satisfy:\n\n318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184\n\nSince n is an integer, n must be from 319 up to 3183 inclusive.\n\nSo, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. Now, how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive?\n\nThe formula is (last - first) + 1.\n\nSo, 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 = 2865.\n\nSo, that's correct. So, n=318 is excluded because 318 is less than 318.309886184, so 1/(318\u03c0) would be greater than 0.001, but wait, no, 1/(318\u03c0) is approximately 0.0009994, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, perhaps my initial calculation was wrong in terms of the inequality direction.\n\nWait, let me double-check: If I have 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, then n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184. So, n must be greater than that. So, n=319 is the first integer greater than 318.309886184. So, n=318 would be less than 318.309886184, so 1/(318\u03c0) would be greater than 0.001, but wait, that's not correct because 1/(318\u03c0) is approximately 0.0009994, which is less than 0.001. Wait, that seems contradictory.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inequality direction. Let me go through it again.\n\nGiven that 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, we can solve for n:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by 0.001\u03c0: 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n\n\nWhich is: 1000/\u03c0 < n\n\nSo, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184. Therefore, n must be at least 319.\n\nBut when n=318, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009994 < 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, why is n=318 excluded? Because according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309886184, so n=318 is less than that, so it's not included. But when n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009994, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Therefore, I think my initial approach is missing n=318 because I used strict inequality, but perhaps I should include it.\n\nWait, let's check: 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.6) \u2248 0.0009994, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n=318 should be included. But according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309886184, which is approximately 318.31, so n=318 is less than that, so it's excluded. But that contradicts the actual value.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the inequality. Let me consider: If I have 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, then n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184. So, n must be greater than 318.309886184, which means n=319 is the first integer that satisfies this. So, n=318 would not satisfy n > 318.309886184, so it's excluded. But then, why does 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009994 < 0.001? That seems contradictory. Wait, no, 0.0009994 is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval, but according to the inequality, n=318 is less than 318.309886184, so n=318 is not included, which would imply that x=1/(318\u03c0) is not in the interval, but it is. So, perhaps my initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me consider that 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nSo, taking reciprocals (and remembering to reverse the inequalities because we're taking reciprocals of positive numbers):\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nThen, dividing by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nWhich is approximately:\n\n318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184\n\nSo, n must be an integer strictly greater than 318.309886184 and strictly less than 3183.09886184.\n\nTherefore, the smallest integer n can be is 319, and the largest is 3183.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n3183 - 319 = 2864\n\n2864 + 1 = 2865\n\nSo, there are 2865 integer values of n, which correspond to 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009994, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. But according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309886184, so n=318 is excluded. So, perhaps my initial assumption is correct, and n=318 is not included because it's less than 318.309886184, which would mean that x=1/(318\u03c0) is greater than 0.001. But wait, 1/(318\u03c0) is approximately 0.0009994, which is less than 0.001, so it's included.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inequality direction. Let me clarify:\n\nGiven 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, solving for n:\n\nn > 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886184\n\nSo, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184, so the smallest integer n is 319.\n\nSimilarly, for the lower bound:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001\n\nSolving for n:\n\nn < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886184\n\nSo, n must be less than approximately 3183.09886184, so the largest integer n is 3183.\n\nTherefore, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, inclusive.\n\nSo, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with an example. Let's take n=319:\n\nx = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.24) \u2248 0.0009977, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval.\n\nn=3183:\n\nx = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.03) \u2248 0.000099999, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's within the interval.\n\nn=318:\n\nx = 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.6) \u2248 0.0009994, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. But according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309886184, so n=318 is excluded. But in reality, x=1/(318\u03c0) is within the interval. So, perhaps my approach is missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the inequalities. Let me re-express the original condition:\n\nWe have 0.0001 < x < 0.001\n\nAnd x = 1/(n\u03c0), so substituting:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001\n\nWhich is:\n\n1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nThen, dividing by \u03c0:\n\n1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0\n\nWhich is approximately:\n\n318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184\n\nSo, n must be strictly greater than 318.309886184 and strictly less than 3183.09886184.\n\nTherefore, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest is 3183.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nSo, even though n=318 gives x\u22480.0009994, which is within the interval, n=318 is less than 318.309886184, so it's excluded. Therefore, the initial calculation is correct, and n starts at 319.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check for n=318.309886184, what is x?\n\nx = 1/(318.309886184 * \u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.000000001) \u2248 0.000999999999999, which is just below 0.001, so n=318.309886184 corresponds to x\u22480.001. So, n must be greater than that to have x < 0.001. Therefore, n=319 is the first integer where x=1/(319\u03c0) \u22480.0009977 < 0.001.\n\nSimilarly, for the lower bound, n=3183.09886184 corresponds to x\u22480.0001, so n must be less than that to have x > 0.0001.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n gives 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184. Thus, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

    "text": " 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) is the same as 10000 / \u03c0. Let me compute that. Since \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, 10000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 3183.0988618. So, n < approximately 3183.0988618. Since n must be an integer, the maximum integer n can be is 3183. Now, let's take the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) 1 / (0.001\u03c0) is the same as 1000 / \u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 divided by \u03c0 is approximately 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618. Since n must be an integer, the smallest integer n can be is 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183, inclusive, I can subtract 319 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 integer values of n, which correspond to 2865 x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 3183 - 319: Let's compute 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865. Yes, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, let me consider whether n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, n = 319, 320, ..., 3183. The number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Yep, that's consistent. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's the answer. Just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. Let me check: For x = 1/(n\u03c0), when n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.07) \u2248 0.000997, which is approximately 0.001. Wait, but 0.000997 is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Similarly, when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.00) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound. So, x = 0.0001 is not included because the interval is open, but x approaches 0.0001 from the right. So, does n = 3183 give x = 1/(3183\u03c0) which is slightly greater than 0.0001? Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0): 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.14159265 \u2248 10000.00 (since 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 10000). So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but is it greater than 0.0001? Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0 exactly. 3183 * \u03c0: Let's compute 3183 * 3.1415926535. 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 0.1416 \u2248 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, 3183 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0928. Adding those up: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.0928 \u2248 450.7128. So total is 9549 + 450.7128 \u2248 9999.7128. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9999.7128, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.7128 \u2248 0.00010000284. So, that's just a bit more than 0.0001, which is within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, for n = 319, let's compute 319\u03c0: 319 * 3.14159265 \u2248 319 * 3 = 957, 319 * 0.14159265 \u2248 319 * 0.1 = 31.9, 319 * 0.04 = 12.76, 319 * 0.00159265 \u2248 0.508. Adding those: 31.9 + 12.76 = 44.66 + 0.508 \u2248 45.168. So, 319\u03c0 \u2248 957 + 45.168 \u2248 1001.168. So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/1001.168 \u2248 0.00099883, which is just under 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, both endpoints are included because x is greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, giving 2865 x-intercepts. I think that's solid. So, the answer is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). To find the number of such x in (0.0001, 0.001), we solve for n:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001  \n=> 318.31 < n < 3183.098  \n\nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) Calculating that: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618 So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618. Since n is an integer, n starts from 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, to find the number of integers in this range, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, number of x-intercepts = 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 x-intercepts in that interval. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 is 2865. That seems correct. But wait, I should make sure that x = 1/(n\u03c0) is indeed within the interval for n = 319 and n = 3183. Let's check n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.972) \u2248 0.000996, which is just above 0.0001, so it's within the interval. For n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but since the interval is open at 0.0001, we need to check if x is greater than 0.0001. Wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but actually, 3183\u03c0 is approximately 10000.0, so 1/10000 is 0.0001. But the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001. So, n = 3183 gives x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is not included. Therefore, n should go up to 3182. Let me recalculate the upper bound. So, when n = 3182: x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000 - a bit). Let me compute 3182 * \u03c0: 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 Let me compute 3000*3.1416 = 9424.8, 182*3.1416 \u2248 571.58, so total \u2248 9424.8 + 571.58 \u2248 9996.38. So, 1/9996.38 \u2248 0.000100037, which is just above 0.0001. So, x \u2248 0.000100037, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. So, n can be 3182. Wait, but earlier I thought n could be up to 3183, but since 3183 gives x \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded, so n should be up to 3182. Therefore, the upper bound for n is 3182, not 3183. Let me recalculate the number of x-intercepts. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3182. So, number of terms is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 = 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865. So, I need to correct that. So, the correct number is 2864. Let me confirm this again. So, n must satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which gives n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988618, so n can be up to 3183, but as we saw, n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001, which is excluded, so n must be up to 3182. Similarly, n must be greater than 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.30988618, so n starts at 319. Therefore, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 is 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Therefore, the answer is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need to find how many such x lie in (0.0001, 0.001). Solving 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 gives n between approximately 319 and 3182. The number of integers in this range is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}."

Since n has to be an integer, the maximum n can be is 3183.\n\nNow, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, divide both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) 1 / 0.001 is 1000, so 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.309. Since n has to be greater than this, the smallest integer n can be is 319.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, to find the number of integers in this range, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, for the lower bound, 1/(0.001\u03c0) is approximately 318.309, so n starts at 319. For the upper bound, 1/(0.0001\u03c0) is approximately 3183.098, so n goes up to 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more to get 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct.\n\nWait another thought: since x must be between 0.0001 and 0.001, and x = 1/(n\u03c0), I should ensure that 1/(n\u03c0) is indeed within that interval. Let me test n=319: 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(319*3.1416) \u2248 1/1002 \u2248 0.000998, which is approximately 0.001, but just a bit less, so it's within the upper bound. For n=3183: 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183*3.1416) \u2248 1/10000 \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound. So, yes, n=319 gives x\u22480.000998 < 0.001, and n=3183 gives x\u22480.0001. So, both endpoints are included, so the count from 319 to 3183 inclusive is correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized, when I substituted the inequalities, I took 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which gives 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0). But let me make sure that's correct. Starting with 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and remembering that reversing inequalities when taking reciprocals because reciprocals reverse the order for positive numbers), we get 1/0.001 > n\u03c0 > 1/0.0001, which is 1000 > n\u03c0 > 10000. Then, dividing each part by \u03c0, we get 1000/\u03c0 > n > 10000/\u03c0. So, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309 and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that's 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but I should check if 1/(319\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Let me compute 1/(319\u03c0): 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 319*3 = 957, 319*0.1416 \u2248 319*0.1=31.9, 319*0.04=12.76, 319*0.0016\u22480.5104. Adding up: 31.9 + 12.76 = 44.66 + 0.5104 \u2248 45.1704. So total is 957 + 45.1704 \u2248 1002.1704. So, 1/1002.1704 \u2248 0.0009978, which is approximately 0.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so that's correct. Similarly, 1/(3183\u03c0): 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 3183 * 3 = 9549, 3183 * 0.1416 \u2248 let's compute 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.04 = 127.32, 3183 * 0.0016 \u2248 5.0928. Adding up: 318.3 + 127.32 = 445.62 + 5.0928 \u2248 450.7128. So total is 9549 + 450.7128 \u2248 10,000. So, 1/10,000 is 0.0001, which is the lower bound. So, n=3183 gives x=0.0001, but the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so does x=0.0001 count? Wait, the interval is open, so 0.0001 is excluded. Hmm, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, x=0.0001 is excluded, so n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is not included. Therefore, n should go up to 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) would be just a bit larger than 0.0001. Wait, that changes things.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recast the problem.\n\nWe have x = 1/(n\u03c0) must satisfy 0.0001 < x < 0.001, so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\nSo, solving for n:\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, we get n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10,000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098.\n\nFrom 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, we get n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309.\n\nSince n must be an integer, n can be from 319 up to 3183, but wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, x cannot be equal to 0.0001, so n cannot be 3183 because that would give x=0.0001, which is excluded. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but since x=1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001 is excluded, the maximum n is 3182.\n\nWait, let me check that. If n=3183, then x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so n=3183 would give x=0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) would be slightly greater than 0.0001. Let me compute 1/(3182\u03c0): 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's see, 3000*3.1416=9424.8, 182*3.1416\u2248182*3=546, 182*0.1416\u224825.82, so total \u2248546 + 25.82=571.82, so total is 9424.8 + 571.82\u224810,000. So, 1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.0001, but slightly more because 3182\u03c0 is slightly less than 10,000, so 1/(3182\u03c0) is slightly more than 0.0001. So, x=1/(3182\u03c0) is just over 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n can be from 319 up to 3183, but n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so the maximum n is 3182.\n\nWait, but earlier when I calculated 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, so n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. So, n must be less than 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but since x=0.0001 is excluded, n can go up to 3182. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: if n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001 exactly, which is excluded. So, the next lower n is 3182, which gives x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.00010002, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, n goes from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nSo, now, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 gives 2864. So, there are 2864 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 2865, but that included n=3183, which gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. So, the correct number is 2864.\n\nWait, let me make sure. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3182. The number of terms in this sequence is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 +1=2864. So, 2864 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought n went up to 3183, I had 2865, but that included n=3183, which is excluded, so the correct count is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me double-check with another approach. The number of integers between a and b inclusive is b - a +1. So, from n=319 to n=3182, that's 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again: 3183 - 319 +1=2865, but since n=3183 is excluded, it's 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, another way: the number of integers greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098 is floor(3183.098) - ceil(318.309) +1? Wait, no, because floor(3183.098)=3183, ceil(318.309)=319, so 3183 - 319 +1=2865. But since x=0.0001 is excluded, we have to subtract 1, giving 2864.\n\nWait, maybe that's complicating it. Alternatively, since n must satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which translates to n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0)=3183.098 and n > 1/(0.001\u03c0)=318.309. So, n can be 319,320,...,3183, but since n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, n goes up to 3182. So, the count is 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial substitution. So, starting with y=sin(1/x)=0, which implies 1/x = n\u03c0, so x=1/(n\u03c0). Then, x must lie in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n, we get 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0), which is approximately 318.309 <n< 3183.098. So, n can be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, but since x=1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001 is excluded, n goes up to 3182, making the count 3182 -319 +1=2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with specific values. For n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009978, which is less than 0.001, so included. For n=3182, x=1/(3182\u03c0)\u22480.00010002, which is greater than 0.0001, so included. For n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001 exactly, which is excluded.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought it was 2865, but after considering the exclusion, it's 2864. Let me just compute 3182 -319 +1: 3182 -319 is 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive is 3183 -319 +1=2865, but since n=3183 is excluded, it's 2865 -1=2864.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the final answer is 2864 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n gives 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3182. The number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 2864.\n\n$\\boxed{2864}$"

Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.309886 So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886. Since n is an integer, n \u2265 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 = 2864; 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again. Hmm, 3183 - 319 is indeed 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. Let me double-check the values of n. The lower bound was 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.31, so n must be greater than that, so the smallest integer n is 319. The upper bound was 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.09886, so the largest integer n is 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, there are 2865 x-intercepts in that interval. Wait, but let me think again. Each n corresponds to a unique x-intercept at x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, each n in that range gives a distinct x in (0.0001, 0.001). So, yes, the number of x-intercepts is equal to the number of integers n from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 2865. But wait, let me check if 1/(3183\u03c0) is indeed greater than 0.0001. Let me compute 1/(3183 * \u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000) \u2248 0.0001. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, so x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, which is the lower bound of the interval. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, does that include x = 0.0001? No, it's open, so x must be greater than 0.0001. So, does that mean that n must be less than 3183.09886, so n = 3183 would give x \u2248 0.0001, which is not included. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.09886, so n can be up to 3183, but x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001 (approximately), but since the interval is open, we have to exclude x = 0.0001. Therefore, n must be less than 3183.09886, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but we need to check if 1/(3183\u03c0) > 0.0001. Wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000.0) = 0.0001 exactly. So, x = 0.0001 is exactly at n = 3183, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, x must be greater than 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) = 0.0001 is not included, so the maximum n is 3182, because n=3183 would give x=0.0001, which is excluded. Similarly, let's check the lower end. The lower bound is x > 0.0001, so n must be such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n\u03c0 < 10000 => n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886. So, n can be up to 3183, but as we saw, x=0.0001 is excluded, so n can be up to 3182. Similarly, at the lower end, x must be less than 0.001, so 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886, so n \u2265 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Now, let's compute the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive. That's 3182 - 319 + 1 = 3182 - 319 = 2863; 2863 +1 = 2864. So, there are 2864 x-intercepts. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but now I'm getting 2864. Which is correct? Let me clarify. When n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. When n=3182, x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182*3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000) \u2248 0.0001, but slightly more than 0.0001 because 3182 is less than 3183. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010003, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n=3182 is included, and n=3183 would give x=0.0001 exactly, which is excluded. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863; 2863 +1 = 2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the subtraction. 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882; 2882 - 19 = 2863. Yes, that's correct. So, 2863 +1 = 2864. So, the final answer is 2864. But wait, let me think again. The function sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times as x approaches 0, but in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a finite interval, the number of zeros should be finite. Each zero corresponds to a solution of 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, the number of such x in (0.0001, 0.001) is the number of integers n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in that interval. So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Which implies 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. But wait, earlier I thought n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, so n should go up to 3182. But let's compute 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886, so n must be less than that. So, n can be up to 3183, but as x=1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded, so n must be up to 3182. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. I think that's correct. Let me just check with an example. If n=319, x\u22480.000997, which is less than 0.001, so included. If n=3182, x\u22480.00010003, which is greater than 0.0001, so included. If n=3183, x\u22480.0001, which is excluded. So, yes, n goes up to 3182. So, the number of x-intercepts is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe number of x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001) is determined by finding the integer values of n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies within the interval. \n\n1. Set sin(1/x) = 0, which implies 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0).\n2. The interval 0.0001 < x < 0.001 translates to 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n3. Solving for n:\n   - Lower bound: n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31 \u21d2 n \u2265 319.\n   - Upper bound: n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886 \u21d2 n \u2264 3183.\n4. However, since x must be greater than 0.0001, n \u2264 3182 to exclude x = 0.0001.\n5. The number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}."

So, flipping them: 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0). Which is 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098862 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098862.

So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, so 2865 x-intercepts. That seems correct, but I should make sure I didn't make a mistake in the bounds. Let me check the exact values: 1/(0.0001\u03c0) is exactly 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 3183.098862, so n must be less than that, so n can be up to 3183. Similarly, 1/(0.001\u03c0) is exactly 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098862, so n must be greater than that, so the smallest n is 319. Therefore, the number of n's is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.

Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.3098862 So, n > approximately 318.3098862. Since n is an integer, the minimum possible n here is 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 = 2864; 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again. Wait, 3183 - 319 is 2864, right? Because 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more to get 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial inequality setup. So, x must be greater than 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001, which gives n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988618, so n \u2264 3183. Similarly, x must be less than 0.001, so 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which gives n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.3098862, so n \u2265 319. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n in that range, which would correspond to 2865 x-intercepts. But wait, that seems like a lot. Let me think again. Is there a possibility that I'm missing something? Because the function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0, so between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a small interval near zero, the function would oscillate rapidly, crossing the x-axis many times. So, 2865 intercepts in that interval might make sense. Alternatively, maybe I should check with specific numbers. Let me try plugging in n=319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.228) \u2248 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001, so that's within the interval. For n=3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.003) \u2248 0.000099999, which is just above 0.0001, so that's also within the interval. So, n=319 gives x\u22480.0009968, which is less than 0.001, and n=3183 gives x\u22480.000099999, which is greater than 0.0001. So, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive are valid. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but let me make sure that I'm not including any n beyond that. For example, n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009993, which is less than 0.0001, so it's outside the interval. Similarly, n=318 would give x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009996, which is just above 0.001, so it's outside the interval as well. So, n=319 is the first valid n, and n=3183 is the last valid n. So, the count is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, sometimes when counting inclusive ranges, it's easy to make an off-by-one error, so I want to be sure. Let me take a smaller example. Suppose I have n from 3 to 5 inclusive. Then, 5 - 3 = 2, plus 1 is 3 numbers: 3,4,5. So, that works. Similarly, from 319 to 3183 inclusive: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. So, for each integer n starting at 319 up to 3183, there's a corresponding x-intercept at x=1/(n\u03c0). So, the total number is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 minus 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0). Let me compute 319\u03c0: \u03c0\u22483.14159265, so 319*3.14159265 \u2248 1003.228. So, 1/1003.228 \u2248 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Similarly, n=3183: 3183*\u03c0 \u2248 3183*3.14159265 \u2248 10000.003. So, 1/10000.003 \u2248 0.000099999, which is just above 0.0001, so it's within the interval. Therefore, both endpoints are included, and the count is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using the behavior of the function near zero. As x approaches zero from the positive side, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates between -1 and 1 infinitely many times. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a finite interval, how many oscillations occur? Each oscillation corresponds to a period of 2\u03c0 in the argument of the sine function. So, the number of oscillations would be the change in 1/x over the interval divided by 2\u03c0.\n\nWait, that might be another way to compute the number of zeros. Let me try that approach. The function sin(\u03b8) has zeros at \u03b8 = n\u03c0. So, the number of zeros in an interval \u03b81 to \u03b82 would be approximately (\u03b82 - \u03b81)/(\u03c0), since each zero is \u03c0 apart. So, \u03b8 here is 1/x, so when x is in (0.0001, 0.001), \u03b8 is in (1000, 10000). So, \u03b8 ranges from 1000 to 10000. The number of zeros would be (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 \u2248 9000/3.14159265 \u2248 2866.197. Hmm, that's approximately 2866 zeros. But earlier, I calculated 2865. The difference is because one of the endpoints might not be included. Let me see: when \u03b8 is 1000, x is 0.001, and when \u03b8 is 10000, x is 0.0001. So, the interval for \u03b8 is [1000, 10000], but the original x interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so \u03b8 is in (1000, 10000). So, the number of zeros would be the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000. So, the first \u03b8 where sin(\u03b8)=0 is \u03b8=1000 + \u03c0, but wait, that's not necessarily the case. Wait, actually, the zeros occur at \u03b8 = n\u03c0, so we need to find the number of n where 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Calculating those: 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098862, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is the same as before. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865, which matches my earlier calculation. The difference between this approach and the previous one is that when I calculated using \u03b8, I got approximately 2866, but that was because I was considering the interval as inclusive, whereas the actual interval is open, so perhaps one of the endpoints doesn't count, leading to 2865. So, both methods lead to the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about the function sin(1/x) between x=0.0001 and x=0.001. Each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, the function completes a half-period, right? So, the number of zeros would be approximately the change in 1/x divided by \u03c0. So, 1/x goes from 10000 to 1000, so the change is 9000. Divided by \u03c0, that's about 2866. But since the interval is open, perhaps we don't include the endpoints, so it's 2865. So, that aligns with my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that each zero occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0), so for x in (0.0001, 0.001), we have 1/(n\u03c0) in (0.0001, 0.001), which implies n in (1000/\u03c0, 10000/\u03c0), which is approximately (318.3098862, 3183.0988618). So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 2865 numbers. So, that's consistent.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I'm not making any mistake in the subtraction. 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Yes, that's correct. So, 319 is the first n, and 3183 is the last n, so the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that step by step: 3183 - 319. Let's break it down: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, add 1: 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should consider whether the endpoints are included or not. Since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001, so the corresponding \u03b8 values are \u03b8=10000 and \u03b8=1000, but not including those points. So, the zeros occur at \u03b8=n\u03c0, where n is such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098862 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. Therefore, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check with specific values. For example, when n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.228) \u2248 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. When n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.003) \u2248 0.000099999, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's within the interval. Therefore, both n=319 and n=3183 correspond to x within the interval. So, the count is correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that between \u03b8=1000 and \u03b8=10000, how many multiples of \u03c0 are there? The number of zeros would be the number of n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. The number of integers n in this interval is floor(10000/\u03c0) - ceil(1000/\u03c0) + 1. Let me compute that: floor(10000/\u03c0) = floor(3183.0988618) = 3183. ceil(1000/\u03c0) = ceil(318.3098862) = 319. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, that's consistent with everything else.\n\nTherefore, after all these checks, I'm confident that the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\).

So, n must satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let's solve for n in each inequality.\n\nFirst inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001 = 10000 => n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098861. So, n can be up to 3183, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, which is 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 10000/\u03c0, so n=3183 would give x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded. So, n must be less than 3183.098861, so the maximum integer n is 3183, but since x must be greater than 0.0001, n must be less than 3183.098861, so n can be up to 3183, but when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000 - \u03c0) \u2248 slightly more than 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nSimilarly, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n\u03c0 > 1000 => n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098862. So, the smallest integer n is 319.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive.\n\nNow, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that:\n\n3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 + 1 = 2864.\n\nSo, there are 2864 integers n such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3182, which means there are 2864 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but let me double-check with a concrete example. Let's take n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.14) \u2248 0.0009968, which is approximately 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. Similarly, n=3182: x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000 - something) \u2248 approximately 0.0001, but slightly more, so it's greater than 0.0001, thus included in the interval.\n\nWait, but 1/(3182\u03c0) is approximately 1/(3182 * 3.14159265) \u2248 1/(10000.000... - a tiny bit), so it's just over 0.0001. So, yes, included.\n\nTherefore, the total number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I subtracted correctly. 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. Alternatively, if I think of the number of integers from a to b inclusive as b - a + 1, then 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864, which matches.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of it as the number of terms in the sequence starting at 319 and ending at 3182, each term increasing by 1, it's (3182 - 319) + 1 = 2864.\n\nSo, I think that's correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nBut wait, I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial setup. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. The closer x is to 0, the more oscillations. But in this case, we're looking at x between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a small interval near 0. So, each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, we get another zero crossing. So, the number of zeros is roughly proportional to the change in 1/x divided by \u03c0.\n\nLet me compute 1/x at the endpoints. At x=0.001, 1/x=1000. At x=0.0001, 1/x=10000. So, the interval in terms of \u03b8=1/x is from 1000 to 10000. The number of zeros of sin(\u03b8) between \u03b8=1000 and \u03b8=10000 is approximately the number of times \u03b8 crosses a multiple of \u03c0 in that interval. So, the number of zeros is roughly (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0 \u2248 9000/3.14159265 \u2248 2866.197. Hmm, that's approximately 2866. But my earlier calculation gave 2864. There's a slight discrepancy here. Maybe because the exact number of zeros is the floor of (10000/\u03c0) minus the ceiling of (1000/\u03c0). Let me compute 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.3098862, so the ceiling is 319. 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098861, so the floor is 3183. So, the number of zeros would be 3183 - 319 +1? Wait, no, because the number of zeros is the number of integers n where \u03b8 = n\u03c0 is in (1000, 10000). So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248318.3098862, so n \u2265319, and less than 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.098861, so n \u22643183. So, the number of integers n is from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. But wait, earlier I thought that n=3183 gives \u03b8=3183\u03c0\u224810000.000..., which is exactly 10000, but our \u03b8 interval is from 1000 to 10000, but open at 1000 and 10000? Wait, no, in terms of x, the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which corresponds to \u03b8=1/x in (1000, 10000). So, \u03b8 is in (1000,10000), so \u03b8 must be greater than 1000 and less than 10000. So, n\u03c0 must be in (1000,10000). So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 <10000.\n\nSo, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0\u2248318.3098862, so n\u2265319, and less than 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.098861, so n\u22643183. But since \u03b8 must be less than 10000, n\u03c0 must be less than 10000, so n<3183.098861, so n can be up to 3183, but when n=3183, n\u03c0\u22483183*3.14159265\u224810000.000..., which is exactly 10000, which is excluded because \u03b8 must be less than 10000. So, n can only go up to 3182, because 3182\u03c0\u22483182*3.14159265\u224810000 - something. Let me compute 3182*\u03c0:\n\n3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.14159265 \u2248 Let's compute 3000*3.14159265=9424.77795, 182*3.14159265\u2248182*3=546, 182*0.14159265\u224825.81, so total\u2248546+25.81\u2248571.81. So, 9424.77795 + 571.81\u22489996.588. So, 3182\u03c0\u22489996.588, which is less than 10000. So, n=3182 gives \u03b8\u22489996.588, which is less than 10000, so included. Then, n=3183 gives \u03b8\u22483183\u03c0\u224810000.000..., which is exactly 10000, which is excluded. Therefore, n can go up to 3182.\n\nSimilarly, n=319 gives \u03b8=319\u03c0\u22481003.14, which is greater than 1000, so included.\n\nTherefore, the number of n is from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 +1=2864.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought of the number of zeros as (10000 - 1000)/\u03c0\u22489000/3.14159265\u22482866.197, which is approximately 2866. But according to the integer count, it's 2864. The difference is because the endpoints are not included. So, the actual number is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Suppose I have \u03b8 between a and b, and I want to count the number of n such that a < n\u03c0 < b. Let's say a=10, b=20. Then, n\u03c0 must be between 10 and 20. So, n must be between 10/\u03c0\u22483.183 and 20/\u03c0\u22486.366. So, n=4,5,6. So, that's 3 numbers. Let's compute using the formula: floor(b/\u03c0) - ceil(a/\u03c0) +1. So, floor(20/\u03c0)=6, ceil(10/\u03c0)=4. So, 6 -4 +1=3, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, in our problem, a=1000, b=10000. So, floor(10000/\u03c0)=3183, ceil(1000/\u03c0)=319. So, number of n is 3183 - 319 +1=2865. But wait, in the smaller example, the formula worked when the interval was open. Wait, in our problem, the interval is open at \u03b8=1000 and \u03b8=10000, so \u03b8 must be strictly greater than 1000 and strictly less than 10000. So, in the smaller example, if a=10, b=20, and \u03b8 must be between 10 and 20, exclusive, then n\u03c0 must be greater than 10 and less than 20, so n must be greater than 10/\u03c0\u22483.183 and less than 20/\u03c0\u22486.366, so n=4,5,6, which is 3 numbers. So, using the formula floor((b-\u03b5)/\u03c0) - ceil(a+\u03b5)/\u03c0) +1, where \u03b5 is a small positive number. So, in our problem, a=1000, b=10000, so we need to compute floor((10000 - \u03b5)/\u03c0) - ceil((1000 + \u03b5)/\u03c0) +1. So, floor(9999.999/\u03c0)=floor(3183.098861 - \u03b5/\u03c0)=3183, ceil(1000.0001/\u03c0)=ceil(318.3098862 + \u03b5/\u03c0)=319. So, 3183 - 319 +1=2865.\n\nBut wait, in the smaller example, when we have \u03b8 strictly between 10 and 20, we have n=4,5,6, which is 3 numbers, but according to the formula, it's 6 -4 +1=3, which is correct. So, in our problem, the number should be 3183 - 319 +1=2865. But earlier, I thought that n=3183 gives \u03b8=3183\u03c0\u224810000, which is excluded, so n should go up to 3182, giving 2864. There's a contradiction here.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because in the smaller example, \u03b8=20 is excluded, so n=6 gives \u03b8=6\u03c0\u224818.849, which is less than 20, so included. Wait, no, 6\u03c0\u224818.849, which is less than 20, so n=6 is included. So, in the smaller example, \u03b8=20 is excluded, but n=6 gives \u03b8=6\u03c0\u224818.849, which is less than 20, so included. So, in our problem, \u03b8=10000 is excluded, but n=3183 gives \u03b8=3183\u03c0\u224810000.000..., which is exactly 10000, so excluded. Therefore, n=3183 is excluded, so the maximum n is 3182, giving \u03b8=3182\u03c0\u22489996.588, which is less than 10000, so included.\n\nTherefore, the number of n is from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 - 319 +1=2864.\n\nBut according to the formula using floor and ceil, it's 3183 - 319 +1=2865, which would include n=3183, but that's excluded because \u03b8=3183\u03c0=10000 is excluded. So, perhaps the formula needs to be adjusted when the interval is open.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is floor((b - \u03b5)/\u03c0) - ceil((a + \u03b5)/\u03c0) +1. So, in our case, floor((10000 - \u03b5)/\u03c0)=3183, ceil((1000 + \u03b5)/\u03c0)=319. So, 3183 - 319 +1=2865. But since n=3183 is excluded, the actual number is 2865 -1=2864.\n\nTherefore, the correct number is 2864.\n\nWait, but in the smaller example, if I set a=10, b=20, and use the formula floor((20 - \u03b5)/\u03c0)=6, ceil((10 + \u03b5)/\u03c0)=4, so 6 -4 +1=3, which is correct because n=4,5,6 are included, each giving \u03b8=4\u03c0\u224812.566, 5\u03c0\u224815.708, 6\u03c0\u224818.849, all less than 20, so included. So, in that case, the formula works without subtracting 1. So, perhaps in our problem, since \u03b8=3183\u03c0=10000 is excluded, we need to subtract 1 from the formula's result.\n\nSo, using the formula floor((10000 - \u03b5)/\u03c0)=3183, ceil((1000 + \u03b5)/\u03c0)=319, so 3183 -319 +1=2865, but since \u03b8=10000 is excluded, we subtract 1, getting 2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the answer is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Solving for x gives x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001  \n=> 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000  \n=> 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0  \n\u2248 318.31 < n < 3183.098\n\nThus, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. The number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\n$\\boxed{2864}$"

    "text": " 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) is equal to 10000/\u03c0, since 0.0001 is 10^-4, so 1/10^-4 is 10^4 = 10000. So, n < 10000/\u03c0. Similarly, for the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) Which is 1000/\u03c0, because 0.001 is 10^-3, so 1/10^-3 is 10^3 = 1000. So, n > 1000/\u03c0. Now, I need to find the integer values of n that satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute these values numerically to get a better idea. I know that \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be an integer greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n must be an integer, n can take values from the smallest integer greater than 318.309886184, which is 319, up to the largest integer less than 3183.09886184, which is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 319 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 1000/\u03c0 is approximately 318.31, so n starts at 319. 10000/\u03c0 is approximately 3183.098, so n ends at 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's the answer. But let me just think if there's any possibility I missed something. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates more and more frequently as x approaches 0. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is very close to 0, the function oscillates very rapidly. Each oscillation corresponds to a peak and a trough, and between each peak and trough, the function crosses the x-axis twice, once going up and once going down. Wait, no, actually, each time sin(\u03b8) goes from 0 to 1 to 0 to -1 to 0, it crosses zero twice per period. But in this case, each x-intercept is when 1/x = n\u03c0, so each x-intercept corresponds to a zero crossing. Wait, but actually, each time sin(1/x) crosses zero, it's at a different x. So, each zero crossing corresponds to a different n. So, the number of x-intercepts in the interval is the number of n's such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in (0.0001, 0.001). So, as I did before, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which gives n from 319 to 3183, which is 2865 integers. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) has x-intercepts where \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\). This occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for integer \\( n \\), so \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).

Thus, \\( n \\) ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, yielding \\( 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 \\) intercepts.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

When x is 0.001, n must be 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.30988618, so the smallest integer n is 319. So, from n=319 to n=3183, inclusive. Now, the count is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute 3183 - 319: 3183 minus 300 is 2883, then minus 19 is 2864. Adding 1 gives 2865. So, yes, that seems correct.

Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, no, actually, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, for the lower bound: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, so n_max = 3183. For the upper bound: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309, so n_min = 319. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Yes, that seems correct. So, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n. Within the interval (0.0001, 0.001), n ranges from 319 to 3183, resulting in 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

    "text": " 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) = 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618 So, n < approximately 3183.0988618. Since n must be an integer, n \u2264 3183. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Similarly, multiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, divide both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618 So, n > approximately 318.30988618. Since n is an integer, n \u2265 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the values: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 = 2864; 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, let me check that subtraction again: 3183 - 319. Let me compute 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. So, yes, 2864, then +1 is 2865. So, there are 2865 integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. Let me double-check the substitution: 0.0001 < x < 0.001, and x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me solve for n in each inequality. For the lower bound: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) \u21d2 n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001 \u21d2 n\u03c0 < 10000 \u21d2 n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618, so the maximum integer n is 3183. For the upper bound: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u21d2 n\u03c0 > 1/0.001 \u21d2 n\u03c0 > 1000 \u21d2 n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618, so the minimum integer n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, yes, 2865 intercepts. I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let me check with n=319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.3) \u2248 0.0009977, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. For n=3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.00) \u2248 0.0001, but since the interval is open at 0.0001, we need to check if x=1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.00) \u2248 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.00, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.0001. So, does x=1/(3183\u03c0) equal exactly 0.0001? Let's compute 1/(3183\u03c0) exactly: \u03c0 \u2248 3.1415926535, so 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 183\u03c0 \u2248 575.01862, so total \u2248 9424.77796 + 575.01862 \u2248 10000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 exactly. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.0001, x=0.0001 is not included. So, does n=3183 give x=0.0001 exactly? Well, if 3183\u03c0 = 10000 exactly, then yes, but \u03c0 is irrational, so 3183\u03c0 is not exactly 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly greater than 0.0001, right? Because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.000000000... but actually, 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001. Wait, no, if 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000, then 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001. So, x=1/(3183\u03c0) would be less than 0.0001, which is not in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3183 would give x=1/(3183\u03c0) < 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3183, but since x=1/(3183\u03c0) < 0.0001, we need to take n=3182. Let me check: 3182\u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 182\u03c0 \u2248 572.00000 (since 180\u03c0=565.48667, 2\u03c0=6.28319, so 565.48667 + 6.28319 \u2248 571.77). So, 3000\u03c0 + 182\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796 + 571.77 \u2248 9996.54796. So, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9996.54796, so 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.54796 \u2248 0.000100035, which is slightly greater than 0.0001. So, x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100035, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, n=3182 is the largest n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. Similarly, for n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.3) \u2248 0.0009977, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, now, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but now I'm getting 2864. So, which one is correct? Let me make sure. The issue is whether n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3182. So, the number of terms is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, the correct number is 2864. Therefore, the initial calculation was off by one because n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) which is less than 0.0001, so it's not included. So, the correct count is 2864. Let me double-check this. So, the lower bound is 0.0001 < x < 0.001. So, x=1/(n\u03c0) must satisfy 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, solving for n: 1/(0.001) < n\u03c0 < 1/(0.0001), which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, so n \u2265 319, and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618, so n \u2264 3183. But wait, earlier I thought that n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since the interval is open at 0.0001, we need to exclude n=3183. So, n must be less than 3183.0988618, so n \u2264 3183, but since x=1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, it's excluded, so n must be \u2264 3182. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. So, I think that's the correct answer. To recap: The x-intercepts occur at x=1/(n\u03c0) for integer n. We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n gives 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3182, which gives 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864 intercepts.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3182. The number of integers in this range is 2864.\n\n$\\boxed{2864}$"

So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309. Since n is an integer, the smallest n can be is 319. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the numbers: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 = 2864; 2864 + 1 = 2865. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again. Hmm, 3183 - 319 is indeed 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. So, x is between 0.0001 and 0.001, which translates to 1/(n\u03c0) between 0.0001 and 0.001. Therefore, n must satisfy 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0). Calculating 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be integers greater than 318.309 and less than 3183.098. Therefore, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, 2865 x-intercepts. That seems correct, but let me think about it differently to verify. Another way to approach this is to consider the behavior of the function y = sin(1/x). As x approaches 0 from the positive side, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times. However, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a finite interval, the function will oscillate a certain number of times. Each oscillation of sin(1/x) corresponds to a half-period, and each zero crossing is an x-intercept. The period of sin(\u03b8) is 2\u03c0, so the period of sin(1/x) as x changes is different. Let me find the derivative to see the behavior, but maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, I can think about how many times 1/x increases by 2\u03c0 as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001. Let me compute the difference in 1/x at the endpoints: At x = 0.001, 1/x = 1000. At x = 0.0001, 1/x = 10000. So, the total change in \u03b8 = 1/x is 10000 - 1000 = 9000 radians. Since each period of sin(\u03b8) is 2\u03c0, the number of periods is 9000 / (2\u03c0) \u2248 9000 / 6.283 \u2248 1432.39. Each period has two x-intercepts (one at the start and one at the end, but actually, between each peak and trough, there's one intercept). Wait, no, actually, each period of sin(\u03b8) has two zero crossings: one when going from positive to negative, and one when going from negative to positive. But in terms of x-intercepts, each period contributes two points where y=0. However, in our case, we're looking for the number of times sin(1/x) crosses zero, which occurs every \u03c0 radians in \u03b8, not every 2\u03c0. Because sin(\u03b8) is zero at every multiple of \u03c0, so between \u03b8 = 0 and \u03b8 = 2\u03c0, there are two zeros: at \u03b8 = \u03c0 and \u03b8 = 2\u03c0. Wait, actually, at \u03b8 = 0, it's zero, then again at \u03b8 = \u03c0, and again at \u03b8 = 2\u03c0, etc. So, between \u03b8 = a and \u03b8 = b, the number of zeros is floor(b/\u03c0) - floor(a/\u03c0). So, in our case, \u03b8 goes from 1000 to 10000. So, the number of zeros is floor(10000/\u03c0) - floor(1000/\u03c0). Let's compute that: 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so floor(3183.098) = 3183. 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so floor(318.309) = 318. Therefore, the number of zeros is 3183 - 318 = 2865. That matches my previous result. So, that confirms that there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the answer should be 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0. This occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n, so x = 1/(n\u03c0).

Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then +1 is 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me double-check that. Sometimes when dealing with inequalities, especially with reciprocals, it's easy to flip the inequality signs incorrectly. So, let me make sure I did that right. The original inequalities were 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me solve for n step by step. Starting with 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0). Taking reciprocals on both sides, remembering that taking reciprocals reverses the inequality: 1/0.0001 > n\u03c0. Which is 10000 > n\u03c0, so n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, which is what I had before. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals again: n\u03c0 > 1/0.001 = 1000, so n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. So, n goes from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so solving 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 gives n between 319 and 3183. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) 1 / 0.001 is 1000, so 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.309.

To find the number of integers in this range, I subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add one (since both endpoints are included). So, number of x-intercepts = 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, when I calculated 1 / (0.0001\u03c0), I got 10,000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than that, so n = 3183 is the largest integer. Then, for the lower bound, 1 / (0.001\u03c0) is 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so the next integer is 319. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Yeah, that seems correct.

So, number of x-intercepts = 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Wait, but let me double-check that subtraction: 3183 minus 319. Let me compute that: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. So, 2864 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, but wait a second. I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me think again. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, if n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, then the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then +1 is 2865. So, that seems correct. But let me check with a smaller example to make sure. Suppose I have n from 2 to 5. The numbers are 2,3,4,5, which is 4 numbers. Using the formula: 5 - 2 + 1 = 4. That works. So, applying it here, 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me think again. Is each n from 319 to 3183 inclusive giving a unique x in (0.0001, 0.001)? Let me confirm that. For n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.99) \u2248 0.000997, which is just below 0.001, so it's within the interval.

Let me verify that. First, check 1/(3183\u03c0): 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 let's compute 3000 * 3.1416 = 9424.8, 183 * 3.1416 \u2248 183*3=549, 183*0.1416\u224825.97, so total \u2248549+25.97\u2248574.97. So, total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.8 + 574.97 \u2248 9999.77. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.77 \u2248 0.000100002, which is just over 0.0001, so that's correct. Now, 1/(319\u03c0): 319 * \u03c0 \u2248 319 * 3.1416 \u2248 300*3.1416=942.48, 19*3.1416\u224859.6904, so total \u2248942.48 + 59.6904 \u22481002.1704. So, 1/(319\u03c0) \u22481/1002.1704\u22480.0009978, which is just under 0.001, so that's correct. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, giving 2865 x-intercepts. But wait, let me think again: when n increases, x decreases because x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, as n goes from 319 up to 3183, x goes from approximately 0.0009978 down to approximately 0.000100002. So, all these x's lie within (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, each integer n from 319 to 3183 corresponds to exactly one x-intercept in that interval. So, the total number is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but let me check if n=3183 is included. Since 1/(3183\u03c0) is just over 0.0001, which is within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.0009978, which is just under 0.001, so it's included. Therefore, the count is correct.
