    "text": " So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the calculation of n's range. Let me compute 1/(0.0001\u03c0) and 1/(0.001\u03c0) again to confirm.\n\n1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618\n\n1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618\n\nSo, n must be greater than 318.30988618 and less than 3183.0988618. Since n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1.\n\nCalculating that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 +1 = 2865.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but just to double-check, let me think about how the function behaves. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. So, between 0.0001 and 0.001, which is a small interval near zero, the function oscillates very rapidly. Each oscillation crosses the x-axis twice, once going up and once going down. But wait, actually, each full period of sin(1/x) corresponds to an increase in n by 1, right? Because the period of sin(1/x) is 2\u03c0/(1/x) = 2\u03c0x, but as x approaches zero, the period decreases. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, the function sin(1/x) has a period of 2\u03c0 in terms of its argument. So, each time 1/x increases by 2\u03c0, the function completes a full cycle. So, the distance between consecutive zeros is when 1/x increases by \u03c0, because between two zeros, the argument increases by \u03c0. So, the distance between consecutive zeros is when 1/(x1) - 1/(x2) = \u03c0, which would correspond to x1 = 1/(n\u03c0) and x2 = 1/((n+1)\u03c0), so the difference in x is 1/(n\u03c0) - 1/((n+1)\u03c0) = (n+1 - n)/(n(n+1)\u03c0) )= 1/(n(n+1)\u03c0). But perhaps that's complicating things.\n\nAlternatively, since each zero occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0), the number of zeros between x = a and x = b is the number of integers n such that a < 1/(n\u03c0) < b. Which is exactly what I did earlier. So, the count is floor(1/(a\u03c0)) - ceil(1/(b\u03c0)) +1, but wait, in our case, a = 0.0001, b = 0.001.\n\nWait, no, actually, 1/(n\u03c0) must be between a and b, so n must be between 1/(b\u03c0) and 1/(a\u03c0). So, n must be greater than 1/(b\u03c0) and less than 1/(a\u03c0). So, n_min = floor(1/(b\u03c0)) +1, and n_max = floor(1/(a\u03c0)). Then, the number of integers is n_max - n_min +1.\n\nWait, let me compute 1/(b\u03c0) where b = 0.001: 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.30988618, so n must be greater than that, so n_min = 319.\n\nSimilarly, 1/(a\u03c0) where a = 0.0001: 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988618, so n must be less than that, so n_max = 3183.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we need to determine where the function crosses the x-axis, i.e., where \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\). This occurs when \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) for some integer \\( n \\), which implies \\( x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\).\n\nWe need \\( x \\) to be within the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\). Therefore, we solve the inequalities:\n\\[ 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\]\n\nRewriting these inequalities:\n\\[ 0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\implies n < \\frac{1}{0.0001\\pi} \\approx 3183.098 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001 \\implies n > \\frac{1}{0.001\\pi} \\approx 318.309 \\]\n\nThus, \\( n \\) must be an integer in the range from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers in this range is calculated as:\n\\[ 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts is \\(\\boxed{2865}\\)."

    "text": " So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but let me just think again: is there a possibility that some n's might result in x outside the interval? For example, n=318 gives x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22481/(1000.5)\u22480.0009995, which is just below 0.001, so it's within the interval. But wait, n=318 is less than 318.309, so according to our earlier calculation, n must be greater than approximately 318.309, so n=319 is the first integer. So, n=318 would give x\u22480.0009995, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Wait, but according to our earlier calculation, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=319 is the first integer. But wait, n=318 gives x\u22480.0009995, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, why did we set n > 318.309? Because 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, so the smallest integer n is 319. So, n=318 would give x\u22480.0009995, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Wait, but according to our inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is less than that, which would give x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.0009995, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, does that mean that n=318 also gives an x-intercept within (0.0001, 0.001)? But according to our initial calculation, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is less than that, which would imply that x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.0009995 is greater than 0.001? Wait, no, 0.0009995 is less than 0.001. Wait, 0.0009995 is 0.0009995, which is 9.995 x 10^-4, which is less than 0.001 (which is 1 x 10^-3). Wait, no, 0.0009995 is 0.0009995, which is less than 0.001. So, 0.0009995 is within (0.0001, 0.001). So, that would mean that n=318 also gives an x-intercept within the interval. But according to our earlier calculation, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is less than that, so n=318 would not satisfy n > 318.309. So, is there a contradiction here? Wait, let's recast the inequality. We had 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which implies n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than 318.309, meaning the smallest integer n is 319. But when n=318, which is less than 318.309, then 1/(n\u03c0) \u2248 0.0009995, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. So, that would suggest that n=318 also gives an x-intercept within the interval, but according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.309, so n=318 is excluded. But that's a problem because when n=318, x is still within the interval. So, perhaps my initial approach was incorrect. Let me re-examine the inequalities.\n\nWe have x in (0.0001, 0.001), which is equivalent to 0.0001 < x < 0.001.\n\nGiven x = 1/(n\u03c0), we substitute:\n\n0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nLet me solve each inequality separately.\n\nFirst inequality: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0)\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0: 0.0001 * n\u03c0 < 1\n\nDivide both sides by 0.0001: n\u03c0 < 10000\n\nSo, n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618\n\nSecond inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001\n\nMultiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by 0.001: n\u03c0 > 1000\n\nSo, n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618\n\nSo, n must satisfy 318.30988618 < n < 3183.0988618\n\nSince n must be an integer, n can take integer values from 319 up to 3183.\n\nWait, but when n=318, let's compute x: x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1000.5) \u2248 0.0009995, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. But according to the inequality, n must be greater than 318.30988618, so n=318 is less than that, which would mean x=1/(318\u03c0) is greater than 0.001? Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me compute 1/(318\u03c0):\n\nCompute 318 * \u03c0 \u2248 318 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 318 * 3 = 954, 318 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 318 * 0.1 = 31.8, 318 * 0.0415926535 \u2248 13.224. So total \u2248 954 + 31.8 + 13.224 \u2248 999.024. So, 1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 1/999.024 \u2248 0.001000976, which is approximately 0.001000976, which is greater than 0.001. So, x=0.001000976 is outside the interval (0.0001, 0.001) because it's greater than 0.001. Therefore, n=318 gives x\u22480.001000976, which is outside the upper bound of the interval. Therefore, n must be greater than 318.30988618, so the smallest integer n is 319. Similarly, for n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.0, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound of the interval. Since the interval is open, x=0.0001 is not included, but x=1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. Therefore, n can be from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Wait, but let me confirm with n=318: x=1/(318\u03c0)\u22480.001000976>0.001, so it's excluded. n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009965<0.001, so included. Similarly, n=3183: x\u22480.0001000028>0.0001, included. So, the count is correct: 3183 - 319 +1=2865.

For x in (0.0001, 0.001), n ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 intercepts.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify When y = 0:**\n   The sine function equals zero at integer multiples of \u03c0. Thus, sin(1/x) = 0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, where n is an integer.\n\n2. **Express x in Terms of n:**\n   Solving for x gives x = 1/(n\u03c0).\n\n3. **Determine the Range for x:**\n   The interval is 0.0001 < x < 0.001. Substitute x with 1/(n\u03c0):\n   - 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.\n\n4. **Solve for n:**\n   - From 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001: n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098.\n   - From 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001: n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309.\n\n5. **Determine Integer Values of n:**\n   n must be an integer between 319 and 3183 inclusive.\n\n6. **Count the Number of Integers:**\n   Number of integers = 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n**Answer:** The number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

    "text": " So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me just think again about whether n=3183 is included. Since 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001000028, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the open interval. Similarly, n=3184 would give x=1/(3184\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099997, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. So, n can go up to 3183.

So, n=318 gives x=0.001, which is excluded, so the smallest n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, giving 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865 intercepts.
