    "text": " 0.0001 * n\u03c0 < 1 Then, dividing both sides by 0.0001\u03c0: n < 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) Similarly, for the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) So now I have: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) < n < 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) Let me compute these values numerically. First, 1 / (0.001\u03c0). 0.001 is 10^-3, so 1/0.001 is 1000. Therefore, 1 / (0.001\u03c0) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 1 / (0.0001\u03c0). 0.0001 is 10^-4, so 1/0.0001 is 10,000. Therefore, 1 / (0.0001\u03c0) = 10,000 / \u03c0 \u2248 10,000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must satisfy: 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n can take integer values from the next integer after 318.309886184, which is 319, up to the integer just below 3183.09886184, which is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can compute 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me calculate that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n in that range, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check that. Sometimes when dealing with inequalities, it's easy to make a mistake with the endpoints. So, the interval is open: (0.0001, 0.001), which means we don't include the endpoints. So, x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. Therefore, the corresponding n values would not include n = 318 or n = 3183, because when n=318, x=1/(318\u03c0) \u2248 0.001000317, which is just above 0.001, so it's excluded. Similarly, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000099915, which is just below 0.0001, so it's also excluded. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184, so the smallest integer n is 319. Similarly, n must be less than approximately 3183.09886184, so the largest integer n is 3183. Therefore, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that makes sense. Each integer n gives a unique x-intercept at x=1/(n\u03c0), and within the interval (0.0001, 0.001), these x-values correspond to n from 319 to 3183, inclusive, giving a total of 2865 intercepts.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Solving for x gives x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to the inequality 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n, we find n must be between approximately 318.31 and 3183.09. Thus, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive, yielding 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 x-intercepts.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

    "text": " 0.0001 * n\u03c0 < 1. Then, dividing both sides by 0.0001: n\u03c0 < 1 / 0.0001. Wait, 1 / 0.0001 is 10000. So, n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n < 10000 / \u03c0. Let me calculate that: 10000 divided by \u03c0, which is approximately 3.1415926535. So, 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618. Since n is an integer, the maximum possible n is 3183. Now, looking at the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Similarly, multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0. Then, dividing both sides by 0.001: n\u03c0 > 1000. So, n > 1000 / \u03c0. Calculating that: 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618. Since n is an integer, the smallest possible n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1. Wait, no. Wait, 3183 minus 319 plus 1. Let me check: if n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and 2864 + 1 is 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me check the calculations again. First, for the lower bound: 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618, so n can be up to 3183. For the upper bound: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u21d2 n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, so n starts at 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then 2864 + 1 is 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. Wait, but I should make sure that all these x-values are within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Let me check for n=319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.18) \u2248 0.0009968, which is approximately 0.0009968, which is between 0.0001 and 0.001. Similarly, for n=3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, which is exactly the lower bound. But since the interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), we need to make sure that x doesn't equal exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. So, for n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since it's open, does that count? Wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but let me compute it more accurately. Let me compute 3183 * \u03c0: 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, and 183\u03c0 \u2248 574.7358. So, total is approximately 9424.77796 + 574.7358 \u2248 10,000. So, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10,000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, does x=0.0001 count? No, because it's not included. So, we need to check whether 1/(n\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. So, for n=3183, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since it's equal, and the interval is open, we might need to check if n=3183 is included. Wait, let's see: 1/(3183\u03c0) = 0.0001 exactly?

    "text": " 0.0001 * n\u03c0 < 1 Then, dividing both sides by 0.0001\u03c0: n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) Let me calculate that: 1/(0.0001) is 10000, so 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n < approximately 3183.0988618. Since n must be an integer, the maximum possible n here is 3183. Now, let's take the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) Let me compute that: 1/0.001 is 1000, so 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618. Since n is an integer, the smallest possible n here is 319. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers inclusive, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add 1. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, and then adding 1 gives 2865. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. 3183 minus 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more gives 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me make sure that 1/(319\u03c0) is indeed greater than 0.001 and 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001. Let me check for n=319: 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(319 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(1003.102) \u2248 0.0009969, which is just under 0.001, so that's correct. For n=3183: 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000.000000000004) \u2248 0.0001, but since it's 1/(n\u03c0), as n increases, x decreases. Wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), we're looking for x strictly greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but since 0.0001 is not included in the interval, we need to check if 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Let me compute 1/(3183\u03c0): 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 10000.000000000004. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 exactly. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so x=0.0001 is excluded. Therefore, n=3183 would give x=0.0001, which is not included, so the maximum n should be 3182. Let me check that: 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182 * 3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000 - a tiny bit) \u2248

    "text": " 0.0001 * n\u03c0 < 1 Then, dividing both sides by 0.0001 * \u03c0: n < 1 / (0.0001 * \u03c0) Let me compute 1/(0.0001\u03c0). Since 0.0001 is 10^(-4), so 1/(10^(-4)\u03c0) = 10^4 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1416 \u2248 3183.098. So, n < approximately 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, the maximum possible n is 3183. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) Compute 1/(0.001\u03c0): 0.001 is 10^(-3), so 1/(10^(-3)\u03c0) = 10^3 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.3099. So, n > approximately 318.3099. Since n must be an integer, the minimum possible n is 319. So, n ranges from 319 up to 3183. Now, I need to count how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, plugging in the numbers: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again. Wait, 3183 - 319: Let's compute 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 -19 = 2864. So, 2864 +1 = 2865. Hmm, that's correct. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the inequalities. Let's double-check the bounds. When x is 0.001, 1/x is 1000, and when x is 0.0001, 1/x is 10000. So, 1/x ranges from 1000 to 10000. So, sin(1/x) will oscillate between -1 and 1 as 1/x increases from 1000 to 10000. The zeros occur at multiples of \u03c0, so the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Therefore, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 and less than 10000/\u03c0. Let me compute 1000/\u03c0: approximately 318.3099, so n starts at 319. 10000/\u03c0 is approximately 3183.098, so n ends at 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive, which is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) crosses the x-axis whenever \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\), where \\( n \\) is an integer.

So, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184.

So, n can take integer values from 319 to 3183, inclusive.

Similarly, 10000 / \u03c0 is approximately 3183.09886184, so the integer part is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183. The number of terms in this sequence is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then add 1: 2864 + 1 = 2865. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me think again. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates as x approaches 0. The number of oscillations increases as x gets smaller. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is from 0.0001 to 0.001, so it's a very small interval near zero. Each time x passes a point where 1/x is a multiple of \u03c0, the function crosses zero. So, each n corresponds to a zero crossing. So, the number of zeros is equal to the number of integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in (0.0001, 0.001). Which is exactly what I computed. So, yeah, 2865 seems right. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n gives 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, leading to 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.31 < n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. Thus, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive.

But wait, let me think about whether n starts at 319 or 318. When I calculated 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.3098862, so n must be greater than that, so the smallest integer n is 319. Similarly, 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.098861, so the largest integer n is 3183. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Wait, but let me make sure that each n in this range corresponds to a unique x in (0.0001, 0.001). Since x = 1/(n\u03c0), and as n increases, x decreases. So, n=319 gives x\u22481/(319*3.1415926535)\u22481/(1002.000000)\u22480.000998, which is just above 0.0001 (since 0.001 is 0.001, so 0.000998 is just below 0.001). Wait, no, 0.000998 is 0.000998, which is less than 0.001, but greater than 0.0001. Wait, actually, 0.0001 is 1e-4, and 0.001 is 1e-3. So, 0.000998 is just below 0.001, but still within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=3183 gives x\u22481/(3183*3.1415926535)\u22481/(10000.000000)\u22480.0001, which is just above 0.0001. So, each n from 319 to 3183 inclusive gives an x in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me check if n=3183 gives x exactly 0.0001. Since 3183*\u03c0\u22483183*3.1415926535\u224810000.000000, so x=1/(10000.000000)=0.0001 exactly. But the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open at 0.0001. So, x=0.0001 is not included. Therefore, n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. So, we need to exclude n=3183. Similarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.000998, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. So, the upper bound for n should be 3182 instead of 3183. Let me recalculate. So, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n > 1000/\u03c0\u2248318.3098862, so n\u2265319. And 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.098861, so n\u22643183. But since x=1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001 is excluded, n can only go up to 3182. So, the range is n from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Now, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 +1 = 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but let me confirm this. When n=3183, x=0.0001 is excluded, so we stop at n=3182. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 +1=2864. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the number of integers between a and b inclusive is b - a +1. So, 3182 -319 +1=2864. So, that seems correct. But let me check with an example. Suppose n=319: x\u22481/(319*3.1415926535)=1/(1002.000000)=\u22480.000998, which is within (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=3182: x=1/(3182*\u03c0)=1/(3182*3.1415926535)=1/(10000 - some small amount). Let me compute 3182*\u03c0: 3182*3.1415926535\u22483182*3.1415926535\u22483182*3=9546, 3182*0.1415926535\u22483182*0.1=318.2, 3182*0.0415926535\u2248approx 3182*0.04=127.28, so total\u22489546 + 318.2 + 127.28\u22489991.48. So, 3182\u03c0\u22489991.48, so x\u22481/9991.48\u22480.00010008, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but 0.00010008 is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Wait, but earlier I thought that n=3183 gives x=0.0001 exactly, which is excluded, so n=3182 gives x\u22480.00010008, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. So, n=3182 is included, but n=3183 is excluded. So, the number of n's is from 319 to 3182 inclusive, which is 3182 -319 +1=2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Solving for x, we get x = 1/(n\u03c0). To find the number of such x in (0.0001, 0.001), we determine the range of n:\n\n1. 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 \u21d2 n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n \u2264 3183.\n2. 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 \u21d2 n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n \u2265 319.\n\nHowever, since x=0.0001 is excluded, n=3183 is excluded.

Since \u03c0 is approximately 3.14159, 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.098. Since n is an integer, the maximum possible n is 3183. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Similarly, multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) Calculating that: 1 / 0.001 is 1000, so n > 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309. Since n is an integer, the smallest possible n is 319. Therefore, n ranges from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1. Wait, no, let's see: If I have numbers from a to b inclusive, the count is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the count is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then +1 is 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the function y = sin(1/x) has 2865 x-intercepts in that interval. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake with the inequalities. So, starting again: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and remembering to reverse the inequalities because reciprocating positive numbers reverses the order): 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. So, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing all parts by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. As before, 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, and 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more is 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, that's correct.

Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts of the function y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, minus 19 more is 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me consider the behavior of the function near x = 0.0001 and x = 0.001. As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates more and more rapidly. But in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is a finite interval, the function will oscillate between -1 and 1, crossing the x-axis each time 1/x increases by \u03c0. So, each time 1/x increases by \u03c0, we get another zero crossing. Therefore, the number of zero crossings is approximately the difference in 1/x at the endpoints divided by \u03c0. Let me compute that. At x = 0.0001, 1/x = 10000. At x = 0.001, 1/x = 1000. So, the difference is 10000 - 1000 = 9000. Then, dividing by \u03c0 gives 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.198. Hmm, wait a minute, that's approximately 2866, but earlier I got 2865. There's a slight discrepancy here. Let me think why. Because when I calculated using n, I had n starting at 319 (which corresponds to 1/x = 319\u03c0 \u2248 1002.13) and ending at n = 3183 (which corresponds to 1/x = 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.0). So, the number of zeros is from n = 319 to n = 3183, which is 2865. But when I compute the difference in 1/x divided by \u03c0, I get 9000/\u03c0 \u2248 2866.198. So, which one is correct? Let me see: the exact number of zeros is the number of integers n where 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001). So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n starts at 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. The number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that's correct. The other approach where I took the difference in 1/x and divided by \u03c0 gives an approximate value, but since the endpoints might not exactly align with the zeros, the exact count is 2865. So, I think 2865 is the correct number of x-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. This gives x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n gives 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

Calculating that: 1/(0.0001) is 10000, so 1/(0.0001\u03c0) is approximately 10000/3.1416 \u2248 3183.098. Similarly, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0. Then, dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1/(0.001\u03c0). Calculating that: 1/0.001 is 1000, so 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 1000/3.1416 \u2248 318.309. So, putting it together, n must satisfy: 318.309 < n < 3183.098. Since n has to be an integer, n ranges from the smallest integer greater than 318.309, which is 319, up to the largest integer less than 3183.098, which is 3183. Now, to find how many integers are in this range from 319 to 3183 inclusive. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, that would be 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then 2864 + 1 is 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 integer values of n, each corresponding to an x-intercept in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, 1/(0.0001\u03c0) is indeed 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098. And 1/(0.001\u03c0) is 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309 and less than approximately 3183.098. Therefore, the smallest integer n is 319, and the largest is 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, that seems correct. But wait, let me check if n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0), which is approximately 1/(1003.12) \u2248 0.0009968, which is greater than 0.0001. Similarly, n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.001) \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.001. Wait, but 0.00009999 is actually less than 0.0001, which is 0.0001. So, that would be outside the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Hmm, that's a problem. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the upper limit. Let me see: The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, x = 1/(n\u03c0) must satisfy 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, let's re-examine the upper bound: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.309. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309, so n starts at 319. Similarly, the lower bound: 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.098, so the maximum integer n is 3183. But wait, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.001) \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's actually outside the interval. So, that means n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's not in the interval. Therefore, the maximum n should be such that x=1/(n\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, the maximum integer n is 3183, but when n=3183, x is just below 0.0001, which is outside the interval. So, actually, we need x > 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098. So, the maximum n is 3183, but when n=3183, x is just below 0.0001, so it's not included. Therefore, the maximum n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n=3183, but since x=1/(3183\u03c0) < 0.0001, that's not included. Therefore, the maximum n should be 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) would be slightly larger than 0.0001. Let me check: 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3182*3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000.000) \u2248 0.0001. Wait, actually, 3182\u03c0 is approximately 3182*3.1416 \u2248 10000.000, so 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. So, x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound of the interval. But since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001, so x=0.0001 is not included. Therefore, the x-intercepts must satisfy x > 0.0001, so n must be less than 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.098, but since x must be strictly greater than 0.0001, n must be less than 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183, but when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999 < 0.0001, which is excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182, because 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010000003, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included. Wait, let me compute 1/(3182\u03c0). Let's compute 3182 * \u03c0: 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, and 182\u03c0 \u2248 571.1878. So, total is approximately 9424.77796 + 571.1878 \u2248 10,000.000. Wait, that can't be. Wait, 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 3182 * 3 = 9546, 3182 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 3182 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 450. So, total \u2248 9546 + 450 \u2248 9996. So, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9996, so 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996 \u2248 0.00010004, which is just above 0.0001. Therefore, x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010004, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. Therefore, n can go up to 3182. So, now, the range for n is from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then +1 is 2864. So, 2864 integer values of n, which correspond to 2864 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but earlier I thought the upper limit was 3183, but since n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00009999, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n is 3182. So, the number of x-intercepts is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. Let me confirm this again. The lower bound for n is 319, because n must be greater than 318.309, so n starts at 319. The upper bound for n is 3182, because n must be less than 3183.098, but since n must be an integer, n=3182 is the maximum. Therefore, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863. Then, adding 1 gives 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2865, but now it's 2864. So, which one is correct? Let's see: If n starts at 319 and ends at 3182, the number of terms is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, 2882 - 19 = 2863, then +1 = 2864. So, 2864 is correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. But wait, let me think again: When n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.12) \u2248 0.0009968, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. When n=3182, x=1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010004, which is just above 0.0001, so it's also within the interval. So, all n from 319 to 3182 inclusive give x in (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the number is 2864. So, the final answer is 2864 x-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of the function \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we determine where \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\).

Each x-intercept is at x = 1/(n\u03c0), so as n increases, x decreases. So, from n=319 to n=3183, each n gives a unique x in the interval. So, the number of intercepts is indeed 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.

So, 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n < approximately 3183.0988618. Since n is an integer, n can be up to 3183.\n\nNow, let's take the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: 1 / (0.001\u03c0) < n Let me compute 1 / (0.001\u03c0). 0.001 is 1e-3, so 1/(1e-3) is 1000. So, 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618. Since n is an integer, n starts from 319.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183 inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, substituting a = 319 and b = 3183: 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Wait, let me check that again. 3183 minus 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, so that would mean there are 2865 x-intercepts. But wait, let me think again. Because when n increases, x decreases. So, as n increases from 319 to 3183, x decreases from 1/(319\u03c0) to 1/(3183\u03c0). Wait, but 1/(319\u03c0) is approximately 1/(319*3.1416) \u2248 1/1003. So, that's about 0.000997, which is just above 0.0001. Similarly, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 1/(3183*3.1416) \u2248 1/10000, which is 0.0001. So, the x-values go from just above 0.0001 to just below 0.001. But wait, the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, I need to check if the endpoints are included or not. Since the interval is open, the endpoints are not included, so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. Therefore, I need to ensure that 1/(n\u03c0) is strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. So, let's go back to the inequalities:\n\n1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 => n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) \u2248 3183.0988618, so n can be up to 3183.\n\n1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 => n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) \u2248 318.30988618, so n starts from 319.\n\nBut wait, when n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so that's okay. When n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0000999, which is just below 0.0001, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), x must be greater than 0.0001. So, does x = 1/(3183\u03c0) satisfy 1/(3183\u03c0) > 0.0001?\n\nWait, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183*3.1416) \u2248 1/10000 \u2248 0.0001, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001 because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 exactly? Wait, no, because 3183*3.1416 is approximately 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, but slightly less. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) is just below 0.0001, which is the lower bound of the interval. Since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001. Therefore, n must be less than 1/(0.0001\u03c0), which is approximately 3183.0988618, so n can be up to 3183, but we need to check if n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) > 0.0001.\n\nWait, 1/(3183\u03c0) = 1/(3183*3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001 exactly? Wait, no, because 3183*\u03c0 is approximately 3183*3.1415926535. Let me compute 3183*3.1415926535:\n\nFirst, 3000*3.1415926535 = 9424.7779605.\n\nThen, 183*3.1415926535: 100*3.1415926535 = 314.15926535.\n\n80*3.1415926535 = 251.32741228.\n\n3*3.1415926535 = 9.4247779605.\n\nAdding those together: 314.15926535 + 251.32741228 = 565.48667763 + 9.4247779605 \u2248 574.91145559.\n\nSo, total 3183*\u03c0 \u2248 9424.7779605 + 574.91145559 \u2248 10,000 (approximately). Wait, that's exactly 10,000. So, 3183*\u03c0 \u2248 10,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001 exactly. But since 3183*\u03c0 is slightly more than 10,000, because \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 3183*3.1415926535 is exactly 10,000.000000000000000000...? Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me check:\n\nWait, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535.\n\nLet me compute 3183 * 3.1415926535:\n\nCompute 3000 * 3.1415926535 = 9424.7779605.\n\nCompute 183 * 3.1415926535:\n\n183 * 3 = 549.\n\n183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 183 * 0.1415926535 \u2248 25.9415926535.\n\nSo, 183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 549 + 25.9415926535 \u2248 574.9415926535.\n\nSo, total 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.7779605 + 574.9415926535 \u2248 9999.7195531535.\n\nSo, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 9999.7195531535, which is less than 10,000. Therefore, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.7195531535 \u2248 0.00010000285. Wait, that's just over 0.0001. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.00010000285, which is greater than 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is just above 0.0001, which is within the interval (0.0001, 0.001). So, n=3183 is acceptable because x=1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Similarly, n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so that's also acceptable.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers in that range, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001).\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because when n increases by 1, x decreases by a small amount. So, each n corresponds to exactly one x-intercept. So, the count should be correct. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the number of terms in the sequence from n=319 to n=3183. So, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to ensure I'm not making a mistake. Suppose I have n from 5 to 10 inclusive. The number of terms is 10 - 5 + 1 = 6, which is correct: 5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nSo, applying that here, 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait, but let me think again about whether n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0) which is just above 0.0001, so it's included in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Similarly, n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0) which is less than 0.001, so it's also included. So, all n from 319 to 3183 inclusive give x in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Therefore, the count is 2865.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n gives 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. The number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Similarly, multiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0. Then, divide both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0).

So, here, it's 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, and 2864 + 1 = 2865.

First, when I calculated 1 / (0.0001\u03c0), that's 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n must be less than that, so the maximum integer n is 3183. Then, 1 / (0.001\u03c0) is 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n must be greater than that, so the smallest integer n is 319. So, the range is from n = 319 to n = 3183. The number of terms in this sequence is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. I think that's the answer. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, when solving for n in the inequalities, I had 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001.

Let me calculate 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. That seems correct.

Let me think. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183, inclusive.

The number of integers is indeed 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, yes, 2865 x-intercepts. Wait, but another thought: does each n correspond to exactly one x-intercept in the interval? Let me think about the behavior of sin(1/x). As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, and sin(1/x) oscillates increasingly rapidly. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is between 10^{-4} and 10^{-3}, the function sin(1/x) will cross the x-axis every time 1/x increases by \u03c0. So, each time x decreases by a factor that corresponds to an increase in 1/x by \u03c0. So, each x-intercept is at x = 1/(n\u03c0), and as n increases, x decreases. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0) where n is an integer such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, which we've already translated into n being between 319 and 3183. So, each n gives a unique x-intercept in that interval. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is indeed 2865. I think that makes sense.

Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Wait, that seems too high. Let me check my calculations again. Wait, 3183 minus 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more to get 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 is 2865. Hmm, but I should make sure that both endpoints are included correctly. Let me see: when n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0), which is approximately 1/(1003.14) \u2248 0.0009968, which is just above 0.0001. Similarly, when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001. Wait, but 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 is about 10000, so 1/(3183\u03c0) is about 0.0001. But our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, x = 0.0001 is excluded, but x approaching 0.0001 from the right is included.

When n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, but since it's open, we have to check if 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001.

So, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 10000 - (0.0988618 * \u03c0). Let's compute 0.0988618 * \u03c0 \u2248 0.0988618 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 0.3098. So, 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 10000 - 0.3098 \u2248 9999.6902.

So, since our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, 0.000100003 is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. So, n = 3183 is included because x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.000100003 > 0.0001. Similarly, n = 319 gives x \u2248 0.0009968 < 0.001, so that's included. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. Now, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then +1 gives 2865. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check. Alternatively, the number of integers between a and b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, there are 2865 integer values of n between 319 and 3183 inclusive. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me think again. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches 0. So, in the interval from 0.0001 to 0.001, which is a very small interval near zero, the function oscillates infinitely many times as x approaches zero, but in our case, we're considering a finite interval. However, since our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is between 0.0001 and 0.001, and we've calculated that n ranges from 319 to 3183, giving 2865 intercepts. But wait, is that correct? Let me think about the behavior of sin(1/x). Each time x decreases by a certain amount, 1/x increases by a certain amount, leading to another oscillation. So, the number of zeros should correspond to how many times 1/x passes through multiples of \u03c0 as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001. So, the number of zeros is essentially the number of n such that 1/(n\u03c0) is in (0.0001, 0.001). So, n must satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Which gives n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.09886 and n > 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309886. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. That seems correct. But wait, let me check with n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000100003, which is just above 0.0001, so included. n=3184: x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.0001000003, which is also above 0.0001, but wait, 3184\u03c0\u224810000.314, so 1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.000099997, which is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, no: 3183\u03c0\u22489999.6902, so 1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000100003, which is greater than 0.0001. But 3184\u03c0\u22483184*3.1415926535\u22483184*3.1415926535. Let me compute that: 3000*3.1415926535=9424.77796, 184*3.1415926535\u2248184*3=552, 184*0.1415926535\u224826.032, so total\u2248552+26.032\u2248578.032. So, 3184\u03c0\u22489424.77796 + 578.032\u224810002.80996. Therefore, 1/(3184\u03c0)\u22481/10002.80996\u22480.000099972, which is less than 0.0001. So, x=1/(3184\u03c0)\u22480.000099972 < 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, n=3183 is the largest n such that x=1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. Similarly, n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.0009968 < 0.001, so included. So, n goes from 319 to 3183, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865. But wait, let me check if n=3183 is included. Since x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.000100003 >0.0001, so it's included. So, yes, n=3183 is included. Similarly, n=319 gives x\u22480.0009968 <0.001, so included. So, the total number is 2865. Therefore, the answer is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). For x in (0.0001, 0.001), n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. Thus, there are 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 x-intercepts.\n\n$\\boxed{2865}$"

Similarly, for the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Then, divide both sides by 0.001\u03c0: n > 1 / (0.001\u03c0) Calculating that: 1 / 0.001 is 1000, so n > 1000/\u03c0. Now, let's compute the numerical values to find the range of n. First, 1000/\u03c0: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 1000 divided by that is roughly 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000/\u03c0 is 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. But n has to be an integer, so n must be from the next integer after 318.309886184, which is 319, up to the integer just below 3183.09886184, which is 3183. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. Now, I need to find how many integers are there from 319 to 3183, inclusive. To find the number of integers between two numbers a and b inclusive, the formula is b - a + 1. So, plugging in a = 319 and b = 3183, we get 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. Therefore, there are 2865 integers n in that range, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts of y = sin(1/x) in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check if I did that correctly. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3183. The number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. Yeah, that seems right. But just to make sure, maybe I can check a smaller example. Suppose I have n from 2 to 5. Then, numbers are 2,3,4,5. So, 5 - 2 = 3, plus 1 is 4, which is correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, I think 2865 is the correct number of x-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of x-intercepts of \\( y = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\), we determine where \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0 \\).

Since \u03c0 is approximately 3.1416, 10000/3.1416 is roughly 3183.098. So, n < 3183.098. Since n must be an integer, the maximum possible n is 3183.

Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). Wait, let me check that. If I have numbers from a to b inclusive, the count is b - a + 1. So, here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, then adding 1 gives 2865. Wait, but let me double-check that subtraction. 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. So, 2864 + 1 = 2865. Hmm, but wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, maybe I should compute it as 3183 - 318 = 2865, because 319 is 318 +1, so subtracting 318 from 3183 gives 2865. Either way, I get 2865. But wait, let me verify with a smaller example to make sure the formula is correct. For example, from 3 to 5 inclusive: 3,4,5. That's 3 numbers. Using the formula: 5 - 3 +1 = 3. Correct. So, applying that, 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. So, that suggests there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but I should also consider whether the endpoints 0.0001 and 0.001 are included. The problem specifies the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be strictly greater than 0.0001 and strictly less than 0.001. So, I need to check if x = 1/(n\u03c0) lies strictly within this interval. So, for n=319: x=1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.9) \u2248 0.000996, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. For n=3183: x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.0) \u2248 0.0001, but since the interval is open at 0.0001, I need to check if x=1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001. Wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000) = 0.0001, but since 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10000, because \u03c0 \u2248 3.1416, so 3183 * 3.1416 \u2248 3183 * 3 = 9549, plus 3183 * 0.1416 \u2248 3183 * 0.1 = 318.3, 3183 * 0.0416 \u2248 132. So, total \u2248 9549 + 318.3 + 132 \u2248 9549 + 450.3 \u2248 9999.3, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/9999.3 \u2248 0.000100007, which is just slightly above 0.0001. Since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 0.000100007 is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Similarly, for n=319, as we saw, x\u22480.000996, which is less than 0.001, so included. So, both endpoints are included in the interval. Therefore, the count from n=319 to n=3183 inclusive is correct, giving 2865 x-intercepts. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial substitution. I set x = 1/(n\u03c0), so for each integer n, we get an x-intercept. So, as n increases, x decreases, approaching zero. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is between 1/10000 and 1/1000, the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0), so n must satisfy 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 and 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, solving for n, we get n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.098, so n can be up to 3183. And n > 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.309, so n starts at 319. Therefore, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 +1 = 2865. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of it as the number of integers between a and b is floor(b) - ceil(a) +1, where a=1000/\u03c0\u2248318.309 and b=10000/\u03c0\u22483183.098. So, ceil(a)=319, floor(b)=3183, so 3183 - 319 +1=2865. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to n ranging from 319 to 3183. The count of integers in this range is 2865.\n\n\\boxed{2865}"

So, the count is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n\nWait a second, that seems like a lot. Let me think if that makes sense. The function sin(1/x) oscillates more and more as x approaches zero. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is quite close to zero, the function should have many oscillations. Each oscillation crosses the x-axis twice, but wait, no, actually, each zero crossing is once per period. Wait, no, the zeros occur every \u03c0/(1/x) change, but I think I might be overcomplicating it. Since each n corresponds to a zero crossing at x = 1/(n\u03c0), and n ranges from 319 to 3183, the number of zeros is indeed the number of integers in that range, which is 2865. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integers n.

    "text": " 0.0001 * n\u03c0 < 1 Then, dividing both sides by 0.0001\u03c0: n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0) Let me compute that: 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 1/(1e-4 * \u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.14159265 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n < approximately 3183.09886184. Since n is an integer, the maximum integer n can be is 3183.\n\nNow, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Dividing both sides by 0.001\u03c0: 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n So, 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1/(1e-3 * \u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.14159265 \u2248 318.309886184. So, n > approximately 318.309886184. Since n is an integer, the smallest integer n can be is 319.\n\nTherefore, n ranges from 319 up to 3183, inclusive. Now, to find the number of integers in this range, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add one (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check the arithmetic. 3183 - 300 is 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. Hmm, that seems right. So, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). But wait a second, I should make sure that each n in this range gives an x within the interval. Let me check for n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1003.32) \u2248 0.0009966, which is less than 0.001. And for n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.001) \u2248 0.000099999, which is just above 0.0001. So, both endpoints are included correctly. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is indeed 2865. Wait, but let me think again. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001, but since the x-intercepts occur at x = 1/(n\u03c0), and n is an integer, we need to make sure that 1/(n\u03c0) is strictly between 0.0001 and 0.001. So, for n = 319, x \u2248 0.0009966, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. For n = 3183, x \u2248 0.000099999, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included. Therefore, the count remains 2865. Wait, but let me check if n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of terms is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that again: 3183 - 319 = 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2865.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs at 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), leading to n ranging from 319 to 3183. The number of integers in this range is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2865}."

    "text": " 0.0001 * n\u03c0 < 1. Then, solving for n: n < 1/(0.0001 * \u03c0) Let me compute that. 0.0001 is 1e-4, so 1/(1e-4 * \u03c0) = 1/(\u03c0 * 1e-4) = 1e4 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1416 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n < approximately 3183.0988618. Since n must be an integer, n can be up to 3183. Now, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Again, multiply both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0. Then, solving for n: n > 1/(0.001 * \u03c0) = 1/(\u03c0 * 0.001) = 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1416 \u2248 318.30988618. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.30988618. Since n is an integer, n starts at 319. So, n ranges from 319 to 3183, inclusive. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this range. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, substituting a = 319 and b = 3183: Number of intercepts = 3183 - 319 + 1 = 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. Wait, let me check that subtraction again: 3183 minus 319. Let me compute 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. So, 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 x-intercepts in that interval. But wait a second, I should make sure that the endpoints are correctly handled. The interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x cannot be exactly 0.0001 or 0.001. So, I need to check if the values at n = 319 and n = 3183 give x exactly equal to 0.001 or 0.0001. Let's compute x when n = 319: x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(319 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(1003.05) \u2248 0.000997, which is just under 0.001. So, it's within the interval. Now, n = 3183: x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183 * 3.1416) \u2248 1/(10000.0) = 0.0001. But since the interval is open, 0.0001 is excluded, so x = 0.0001 is not included. Therefore, n = 3183 gives x = 0.0001, which is not in the interval, so we should exclude n = 3183. Similarly, n = 319 gives x \u2248 0.000997, which is just under 0.001, so it's included. Therefore, the upper bound for n is 3182, not 3183. Let me recalculate the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, 3182 - 319 + 1 = 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. Wait, that's different from before. Hmm, so I think I made a mistake earlier by including n = 3183. Let me verify this. When n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound of the interval, but since the interval is open at 0.0001, that point is excluded. Therefore, n must be less than 3183, so the maximum n is 3182. Therefore, the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. Let me check that subtraction again: 3182 - 319. 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863. Then, 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, the correct number is 2864. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything else. The function y = sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely many times as x approaches 0, but in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), it's a finite interval, so the number of zeros should be finite. Each zero corresponds to a value of n where 1/x = n\u03c0, so x = 1/(n\u03c0). Therefore, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Which translates to 1/(0.001\u03c0) < n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0). Calculating those: 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, so n must be greater than that, so n \u2265 319. Similarly, 1/(0.0001\u03c0) = 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618, so n must be less than that, so n \u2264 3183. But since x must be greater than 0.0001, which is 1/(3183\u03c0), we exclude n = 3183 because that would make x = 0.0001, which is not included. Therefore, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) crosses the x-axis whenever 1/x is an integer multiple of \u03c0, leading to x = 1/(n\u03c0) for integer n. In the interval (0.0001, 0.001), n ranges from 319 to 3182, inclusive. Thus, there are 2864 x-intercepts.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}."

    "text": " 0.0001 * n\u03c0 < 1 Dividing both sides by 0.0001: n\u03c0 < 1 / 0.0001 n\u03c0 < 10000 Similarly, the second inequality: 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 Multiplying both sides by n\u03c0: 1 < 0.001 * n\u03c0 Dividing both sides by 0.001: 1000 < n\u03c0 So now we have: 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000 To find n, we can divide all parts by \u03c0: 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0 Let me compute these values. First, 1000 divided by \u03c0. I know \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 1000 / \u03c0 \u2248 1000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 318.309886184. Similarly, 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.09886184. So, n must be greater than approximately 318.309886184 and less than approximately 3183.09886184. Since n has to be an integer, n can take integer values from 319 up to 3183. Now, to find the number of integers between 319 and 3183 inclusive, I can subtract 318 from 3183 and add 1 (since both endpoints are inclusive). Wait, no, actually, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So here, a is 319 and b is 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers n such that 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3183. Therefore, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check that. Sometimes when dealing with inequalities, especially with reciprocals, it's easy to make a mistake. So, let me verify the steps again.\n\nStarting from 0.0001 < x < 0.001, and x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, substituting gives 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and remembering that reversing the inequalities because reciprocals reverse the order for positive numbers), we get 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which simplifies to 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, as I had before. Then dividing by \u03c0 gives 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.309886184 < n < 3183.09886184. So n must be from 319 to 3183 inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then adding 1 gives 2865. So, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, let me consider the endpoints. When n = 319, x = 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.77) \u2248 0.000997, which is approximately 0.001, but slightly less. Wait, 0.000997 is actually 0.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the interval. Similarly, when n = 3183, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(10000.00) \u2248 0.0001, which is exactly 0.0001. But since the interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), we need to check whether x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is greater than 0.0001 or not. Wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, but let me compute it more accurately. 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 3183 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let me compute 3000 * \u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, and 183 * \u03c0 \u2248 574.51947. So total is approximately 9424.77796 + 574.51947 \u2248 10,000. So, 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/10000 \u2248 0.0001. But since 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10,000, because 3183 * \u03c0 = 3183 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute 3183 * 3.1415926535 more accurately.\n\nCompute 3000 * \u03c0 = 9424.77796\n\n183 * \u03c0: 100\u03c0 = 314.159265, 80\u03c0 \u2248 251.327412, 3\u03c0 \u2248 9.42477796. So adding those: 314.159265 + 251.327412 = 565.486677 + 9.42477796 \u2248 574.911455.\n\nSo total 3183\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796 + 574.911455 \u2248 10,000. (Approximately exactly 10,000 because 3183 * \u03c0 \u2248 10,000). So 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001. But since 3183\u03c0 is slightly more than 10,000, 1/(3183\u03c0) is slightly less than 0.0001. So, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is just below 0.0001, which is the lower bound of the interval. But our interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, so x must be greater than 0.0001. Therefore, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is not included. So, n must be less than 3183.09886184, but since n must be an integer, the maximum n is 3183, but as we saw, x = 1/(3183\u03c0) is less than 0.0001, so it's excluded. Therefore, the maximum n such that x = 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 is n = 3182. Let me check that.\n\nIf n = 3182, then x = 1/(3182\u03c0). Compute 3182\u03c0: 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535. Let me compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796, 182\u03c0 \u2248 182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 Let's compute 100\u03c0 \u2248 314.159265, 80\u03c0 \u2248 251.327412, 2\u03c0 \u2248 6.283185307. So 314.159265 + 251.327412 = 565.486677 + 6.283185307 \u2248 571.769862. So, total 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796 + 571.769862 \u2248 9996.547822. So, x = 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.547822 \u2248 0.000100034, which is just over 0.0001. So, x \u2248 0.000100034, which is greater than 0.0001, so it's included in the interval. Therefore, n can be 3182, but not 3183. So, earlier, I thought n goes up to 3183, but actually, n can only go up to 3182 because 3183 gives x less than 0.0001, which is excluded. So, correcting that, the upper bound for n is 3182. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Now, let's compute the number of integers from 319 to 3182 inclusive. That would be 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, then 2863 + 1 = 2864. So, there are 2864 integers in that range. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. Wait, but earlier I thought n went up to 3183, giving 2865 intercepts, but now I see that n=3183 gives x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is excluded because the interval is open. So, the correct upper limit is n=3182, which gives x\u22480.000100034, which is included. So, the number of intercepts is 2864. Let me double-check that calculation.\n\nn starts at 319 and ends at 3182. So, the number of terms is 3182 - 319 + 1. 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, 2864 intercepts. But wait, let me think again. When n=319, x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.000997, which is less than 0.001, so it's included. When n=3182, x\u22480.000100034, which is just over 0.0001, so included. So, n runs from 319 to 3182, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3182 - 319: 3182 - 300 = 2882, then subtract 19 more: 2882 - 19 = 2863. Then add 1: 2864. So, 2864 intercepts. But wait, earlier I thought 3183\u03c0\u224810,000, so 1/(3183\u03c0)=0.0001, but since it's open, we exclude it, so n=3183 is excluded, so the maximum n is 3182. Therefore, the number of intercepts is 2864. But let me check if n=319 gives x=1/(319\u03c0)\u22480.000997, which is less than 0.001, so included. And n=3182 gives x\u22480.000100034, which is just over 0.0001, so included. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. But wait, let me think again about the initial substitution. We have sin(1/x)=0 when 1/x = n\u03c0, so x=1/(n\u03c0). So, for each integer n, we have an x-intercept at x=1/(n\u03c0). Now, we need x to be in (0.0001, 0.001). So, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Taking reciprocals (and flipping inequalities because reciprocals reverse the order for positive numbers): 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. As calculated earlier, 1000/\u03c0\u2248318.309886184 and 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.09886184. So, n must be integers from 319 to 3183. But wait, when n=3183, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is the lower bound, but since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001. So, x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001 is not included, so n=3183 is excluded. Therefore, n goes up to 3182. So, n ranges from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Therefore, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864. But wait, let me confirm with a small example. Suppose the interval is (a, b), and we have x=1/(n\u03c0). So, a < 1/(n\u03c0) < b. Taking reciprocals: 1/b < n\u03c0 < 1/a. So, n must satisfy (1/b)/\u03c0 < n < (1/a)/\u03c0. Since n must be integer, n starts at the ceiling of (1/b)/\u03c0 and ends at the floor of (1/a)/\u03c0. So, in our case, a=0.0001, b=0.001. So, (1/b)/\u03c0 = 1000/\u03c0\u2248318.309886184, so ceiling is 319. (1/a)/\u03c0 = 10000/\u03c0\u22483183.09886184, so floor is 3183. But since x=1/(3183\u03c0)\u22480.0001, which is excluded, we take n up to 3182. So, n from 319 to 3182 inclusive. Therefore, number of n is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. Therefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.

To find x in (0.0001, 0.001), we solve 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, leading to 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Dividing by \u03c0, we get approximately 318.31 < n < 3183.09. The integers n range from 319 to 3182, inclusive. The number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\nThe number of x-intercepts is \\boxed{2864}."

The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, substituting a = 319 and b = 3183, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1.

Then the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. 3183 - 319 is indeed 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. Yeah, that seems correct.

To find the number of integers between two numbers inclusive, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add 1. So, number of integers = 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 = 2864, then 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, there are 2865 integers in that range, which means there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, the substitution: x = 1/(n\u03c0), correct. Then, 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) implies n < 1/(0.0001\u03c0), which is correct. Similarly, 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001 implies n > 1/(0.001\u03c0), correct. Calculating 1/(0.0001\u03c0): 0.0001 is 1e-4, so 1/(1e-4\u03c0) = 1e4/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618, so n < 3183.0988618, so n_max = 3183. Then, 1/(0.001\u03c0) = 1e3/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618, so n must be greater than 318.30988618, so n_min = 319. Then, the number of integers from 319 to 3183 inclusive is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let's compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 = 2883, then subtract 19 more: 2883 - 19 = 2864. Then, 2864 + 1 = 2865. So, that seems correct.

Let me compute that: \u03c0 is approximately 3.1415926535, so 10000 / \u03c0 \u2248 10000 / 3.1415926535 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than approximately 3183.0988618.

Now, to find the number of integers in this range, we can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add one (since both endpoints are included). So, the number of x-intercepts is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, and adding 1 gives 2865. So, there are 2865 x-intercepts in the interval (0.0001, 0.001). Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me verify the inequalities again.\n\nStarting with 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Rearranged, that's 1/(0.001) > n\u03c0 > 1/(0.0001). So, 1000 > n\u03c0 > 10000. Dividing all parts by \u03c0, we get 1000/\u03c0 > n > 10000/\u03c0. Wait, that seems conflicting with what I did earlier. Wait, hold on, perhaps I mixed up the inequalities.\n\nWait, let me correct this. The original inequalities are 0.0001 < x < 0.001, and x = 1/(n\u03c0). So, substituting x, we have 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Let me take reciprocals on all parts, remembering that taking reciprocals reverses the inequalities. So, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001. That is, 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. Then, dividing all parts by \u03c0, we get 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0. So, n must be greater than 1000/\u03c0 \u2248 318.30988618 and less than 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. Since n must be an integer, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3183 - 319 is 2864, plus 1 is 2865. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so n is between 318.31 and 3183.098. So, n starts at 319 and ends at 3183, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1. Let me compute 3183 - 319: 3183 - 300 is 2883, minus 19 is 2864. Then, adding 1 gives 2865. So, 2865 x-intercepts.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the reciprocals. So, if 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001, then taking reciprocals, 1/0.001 < n\u03c0 < 1/0.0001, which is 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000. So, that's correct. Therefore, n must satisfy 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0, which is approximately 318.31 < n < 3183.098. So, n is from 319 to 3183, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865.\n\nWait, but let me check if n=319 is included. So, 1/(319\u03c0) is approximately 1/(319*3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(1002.28) \u2248 0.0009977, which is less than 0.001, so it's within the upper bound. Similarly, n=3183: 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 1/(3183*3.1415926535) \u2248 1/(10000.0) = 0.0001, which is exactly the lower bound. But since the interval is open, (0.0001, 0.001), we need to check if x=0.0001 is included or not. Since it's open, x=0.0001 is not included, so we need to ensure that 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n\u03c0 < 10000, so n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n can be up to 3183, because 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.0, but since 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is the lower bound, and the interval is open, so x=0.0001 is not included. So, does that mean n=3183 is not included? Wait, because 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, which is the lower limit, but since the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), which is open, x=0.0001 is not included. So, does that mean n=3183 is excluded? Hmm, that's a good point.\n\nWait, let me think again. So, x must be greater than 0.0001 and less than 0.001. So, 0.0001 < x < 0.001. So, x=1/(n\u03c0) must satisfy 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001, which implies n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. Since n must be an integer, the maximum n is 3183. But 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is exactly the lower bound. Since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so 1/(n\u03c0) must be greater than 0.0001. So, 1/(n\u03c0) > 0.0001 implies n < 10000/\u03c0 \u2248 3183.0988618. So, n must be less than that, so the maximum integer n is 3183. But wait, 1/(3183\u03c0) is approximately 0.0001, so it's equal to the lower bound. Since the interval is open, x must be greater than 0.0001, so x=0.0001 is excluded. Therefore, n=3183 would give x=1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded. So, does that mean n can only go up to 3182? Let me check that.\n\nWait, let's compute 1/(3182\u03c0). Let me compute 3182 * \u03c0 \u2248 3182 * 3.1415926535 \u2248 let's see, 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77, 182\u03c0 \u2248 571.84, so total \u2248 9424.77 + 571.84 \u2248 9996.61. So, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.61 \u2248 0.000100034, which is slightly above 0.0001. So, that's acceptable because the interval is (0.0001, 0.001), so x must be greater than 0.0001, so 0.000100034 is acceptable. On the other hand, n=3183: 3183\u03c0 \u2248 10000.0, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is exactly the lower bound, but since the interval is open, it's excluded. Therefore, n can go up to 3182. So, the upper limit for n is 3182.\n\nSimilarly, let's check the lower limit. n=319: 1/(319\u03c0) \u2248 1/(1002.28) \u2248 0.0009977, which is less than 0.001, so it's included in the interval. So, n starts at 319 and goes up to 3182, inclusive. So, the number of integers is 3182 - 319 + 1. Let me compute that: 3182 - 319 = 2863, plus 1 is 2864. So, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n went up to 3183, but since n=3183 gives x=0.0001, which is excluded, the maximum n is 3182. So, the number of x-intercepts is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864. Hmm, so I think I made a mistake earlier by including n=3183, which gives x=0.0001, which is excluded because the interval is open. So, the correct number is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this. Let's compute 3182\u03c0 and 3183\u03c0 to see exactly where they fall.\n\nCompute 3182 * \u03c0:\n\n\u03c0 \u2248 3.1415926535\n\n3182 * 3.1415926535\n\nLet me compute 3000\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796\n\n182\u03c0: 180\u03c0 \u2248 565.48667, 2\u03c0 \u2248 6.28319, so total \u2248 565.48667 + 6.28319 \u2248 571.770\n\nSo, 3182\u03c0 \u2248 9424.77796 + 571.770 \u2248 9996.54796\n\nSo, 1/(3182\u03c0) \u2248 1/9996.54796 \u2248 0.000100034, which is just above 0.0001, so it's included.\n\nNow, 3183\u03c0 \u2248 3182\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2248 9996.54796 + 3.1415926535 \u2248 10000.0, so 1/(3183\u03c0) \u2248 0.0001, which is excluded.\n\nSo, n goes up to 3182, so the number of x-intercepts is 3182 - 319 + 1.\n\nCompute 3182 - 319:\n\n3182 - 300 = 2882\n\n2882 - 19 = 2863\n\nSo, 3182 - 319 = 2863\n\nAdd 1: 2863 + 1 = 2864\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 3183 - 319 +1 was 2865, but that included n=3183, which gives x=0.0001, which is excluded. So, the correct count is 2864.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the subtraction.\n\nCompute 3182 - 319:\n\n3182 - 300 = 2882\n\n2882 - 19 = 2863\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 2863 +1 = 2864.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a +1.\n\nSo, from n=319 to n=3182, inclusive, the number of terms is 3182 - 319 +1.\n\nCompute 3182 - 319:\n\n3182 - 300 = 2882\n\n2882 - 19 = 2863\n\nSo, 2863 +1 = 2864.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is 2864.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering the behavior of the function.\n\nWe know that as x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x approaches infinity, so sin(1/x) oscillates increasingly rapidly between -1 and 1. So, in the interval (0.0001, 0.001), which is close to zero, the function oscillates very rapidly, crossing the x-axis many times.\n\nEach time 1/x passes through a multiple of \u03c0, the function crosses the x-axis. So, the number of zeros is the number of times 1/x passes through n\u03c0 as x decreases from 0.001 to 0.0001.\n\nSo, the values of 1/x go from 1000 to 10000 as x goes from 0.001 to 0.0001.\n\nSo, the number of times sin(1/x) crosses zero is the number of integer multiples of \u03c0 between 1000 and 10000.\n\nSo, the number of zeros is the number of integers n such that 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000.\n\nWhich is the same as n satisfying 1000/\u03c0 < n < 10000/\u03c0.\n\nWhich is approximately 318.31 < n < 3183.098.\n\nSo, n ranges from 319 to 3183, but since 1/(3183\u03c0) is exactly 0.0001, which is excluded, n goes up to 3182.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, the number of zeros is the number of n where n\u03c0 is between 1000 and 10000, exclusive at 10000 because x=0.0001 is excluded.\n\nSo, n must satisfy 1000 < n\u03c0 < 10000, so n must be from 319 to 3182, inclusive.\n\nTherefore, the number of zeros is 3182 - 319 +1 = 2864.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function y = sin(1/x) has x-intercepts where sin(1/x) = 0, which occurs when 1/x = n\u03c0 for integer n. Thus, x = 1/(n\u03c0). We need x in (0.0001, 0.001), so 0.0001 < 1/(n\u03c0) < 0.001. Solving for n gives 319 \u2264 n \u2264 3182. The number of integers in this range is 3182 - 319 + 1 = 2864.\n\n$\\boxed{2864}$"
