    "text": " Let me think about how to find the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). If I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be when the exponent on \\(a\\) is 2 and on \\(b\\) is 2. Since the total exponent is 4, that makes sense because 2 + 2 = 4. So, using the binomial theorem, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I need to consider the other part as well? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me see. The expression is a product of two binomials: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient from the second part doesn't affect it? Or does it? Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient is just 6? But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would imply that we are looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, leaving just \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) can't really cancel out unless we have equal exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(-c\\), but in this case, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded will have terms with exponents from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, unless we're specifically looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which would be the constant term, that term would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), giving just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6 to get the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). Okay, so let me work on that. To find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can again use the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me compute it correctly. \\(6! = 720\\), and \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 720 / (6 \\times 6) = 720 / 36 = 20\\). Yes, that's correct. So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and then it's multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I were to expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) with the constant term in the second expansion, since any other term would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would change the term. So, yeah, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nThe constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two parts:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient here is 6. But wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider both expansions and see how they interact. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the second part of the product involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, I think that the terms in the second expansion won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the second part would contribute to the overall expression, but not to the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 times whatever the entire second part is, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), maybe I just need to take 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion. But that would be 6 times \\(2^6\\) because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would have terms that sum up when evaluated at certain points, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by 6, it would contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) for each possible power of \\(c\\). So, to find the total coefficient, I need to compute 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expression is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me double-check that. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first part, and the second part can be any term, so the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.

    "text": " Let me think about expanding that part first. \n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), using the binomial theorem, each term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\). That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), I think the coefficients in the first part don't directly influence the second part. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever coefficient comes from the second part when considering the same term? Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply for each term. But in this case, the terms are separate because one part involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms.

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) would just contribute a coefficient that doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) is 1, and multiplying by that doesn't change the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and I multiply it by \\(c^k\\) from the second part, the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be part of the expansion. But if I'm only interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\), I need the coefficient when \\(k = 0\\), because that's when the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nSo, let me calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the coefficient from the second part (20), giving 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 for \\(c^0\\), so when you multiply these together, you get 120 for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) because the \\(c^0\\) term is just 1, so it doesn't change the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient is 120. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the entire expansion being the product of the two expansions, so each term is a product of a term from each expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, you have to multiply it by any term from the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we have to consider the term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one polynomial and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the other, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by the constant term (c^0) from the second polynomial. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, that seems consistent.\n\nLet me just double-check my calculations. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying these together gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, I'm confident the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for each part separately.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

When I expand that, it will have terms with different powers of c, but since the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the c terms don't affect that? Or do they? Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in c, but the problem is just asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these out, each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second expansion multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in c. But that seems complicated, and the problem might just be expecting a numerical coefficient, which suggests that maybe the c terms are supposed to cancel out or something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating c as a variable independent of a and b, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in c. But the problem didn't specify, so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, let me check the original problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms. So, in other words, when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in c, not a single number. That doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by other variables. But that seems odd because the two parts are multiplied together, so the coefficients would combine. Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to treat the entire expression as a product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, meaning that the coefficient would be a sum over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in c, which might not be what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the c terms are separate variables, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. Hmm, this is confusing. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating c as a separate variable, so the coefficient would include the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the entire second expansion. But again, that would result in a polynomial, not a number. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, and since the c terms are separate, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved, and the problem might just be expecting a numerical coefficient, which suggests that maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a product of two separate expansions, and the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by other variables. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something like that, but it's not specified. Alternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\), but that's just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and since the c terms are separate, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems too much. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is there to test if I realize that it doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that seems a bit too simplistic. Wait, let me think again. When you have two separate expressions multiplied together, like \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the terms in the product are the products of terms from each expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in c, which might not be what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, meaning that the c terms are treated as separate variables, so the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated, and the problem might just be expecting a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. When you multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in c, which is not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating c as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the c terms are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the c terms are part of the other variables. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, the coefficients combine. Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is there to test if I realize that it doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that seems too simple, and the problem includes both parts, so I think that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of a, b, and c are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. But that's not specified in the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But again, that's a polynomial, not a number. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, but considering that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just expecting me to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and since the other part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is separate, the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simplistic, and I think the problem is expecting me to consider the entire product. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where a and b are squared and c is to the zero power. In that case, I would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has c^0, which is the constant term, and then multiply it by 6. That seems plausible. So, let me try that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the constant term (c^0) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and multiply those two coefficients together. That would give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product. So, let's do that. First, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of c is 0, so 6 - 2k = 0. Solving for k: 6 - 2k = 0 \u2192 2k = 6 \u2192 k = 3. So, the constant term is when k = 3, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 6} = \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20 \\times 1 = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but the problem didn't specify anything about c, so maybe I'm overcomplicating it by considering the c terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. So, maybe the problem is actually expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the c terms are separate, so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simple, and I think the problem is expecting me to consider the entire product. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the c terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial. Hmm, this is confusing. Let me try to clarify. The problem is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. When you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in c, which is not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by other variables. But that seems too simplistic, and the problem includes both parts, so I think that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the c terms are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the c terms are part of the other variables. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, the coefficients combine. Hmm, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\), but that's just a guess. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the entire second expansion. But again, that would result in a polynomial, not a number. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating c as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

So, the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Got that down.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Looking at the expansion, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 6. But wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nHmm, let me think. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, every term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can focus on the part of the multiplication that affects \\(a^2b^2\\). Specifically, the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the multiplication by terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) won't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because each term in the second expression is multiplied by 6a^2b^2, so the overall coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), or just \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by all possible terms in \\(c\\)?\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me rephrase the problem: I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like the coefficient would be 6 times a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I need to find the term in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" Hmm, it just says \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is considering the entire product and just wants the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. That doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, I think that's the correct interpretation. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\) in the product. That is, the term where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero.\n\nSo, to clarify, the term we're looking for is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, first, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's \\(6! / (3! \\cdot (6 - 3)!) = (720)/(6 \\cdot 6) = 720 / 36 = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, including the \\(c^0\\) term. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the binomial coefficients. For \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's 20, correct? Let me compute it again: 6 choose 3 is (6*5*4)/(3*2*1) = 120/6 = 20. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAnd in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, as calculated before. So, multiplying them gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (considering \\(c^0\\)) is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so maybe I'm misinterpreting it. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that seems odd because the coefficient is usually a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That makes more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't seem right for this question.\n\nSo, to confirm, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6*20=120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. But that can't be right because coefficients are numbers, not polynomials. So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, and the rest of the expression is multiplied by it, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nLet me also consider another approach. The entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, the correct interpretation must be that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1.\n\nSo, to find that, I need to compute 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6*20=120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent binomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, so the combined coefficient is 6*20=120. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(k=3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6*20=120. Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiplying them together.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Let me write that out using the binomial theorem.\n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Simplifying the coefficients, that would be \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). Okay, so I see that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I have to consider that as well? Hmm, maybe I need to think about how these two expansions interact.\n\nWait, let me think. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is only present in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to consider the other terms in the second expansion because they won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Hmm, is that correct?\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), then each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with the c terms. So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can ignore the c terms because they won't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the final product. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second expansion, the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of c and 1/c. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiple times in the product, each multiplied by different powers of c. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes its own coefficient, and all of those will add up to the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Because when I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of c. But when I multiply this by \\(a^2b^2\\), the resulting term is \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each of these terms will have a coefficient of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for the \\(a^2b^2\\) part, but the c terms vary. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms. So, actually, all these terms will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because the c terms are separate variables. Wait, but no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c. So, that means all the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of c will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you have two independent variables, a and c, the terms involving a and b are separate from the terms involving c. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of coefficients in the second part because each term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me consider the entire product: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Each of those terms has a coefficient, and when you add them all together, you get the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, since the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, that seems right. Alternatively, if I think about the variables being independent, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as if I set c = 1, because setting c = 1 would make the second expansion equal to (1 + 1)^6 = 64, and then the entire expression becomes (a + b)^4 * 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. That also makes sense.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " So, let me write that out.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\((a + b)^4\\) would be equal to \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\\).

So, expanding it, we get \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nAlright, so that's the expansion of the first part. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to expand that part as well and then multiply it by the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to consider the entire expansion. Instead, I can just focus on the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part. That should give me the terms that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k}c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 + \\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 + \\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 + \\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 + \\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} + \\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} + \\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6}\\).\n\nCalculating the coefficients, \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\). So, the expansion becomes \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, we have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), we can take that term and multiply it by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, when we multiply, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore the other terms in the first expansion.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when we multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will multiply each term in the second expansion, giving us terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4\\), and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we're looking for all terms where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of the power of \\(c\\)?\n\nWait, no, actually, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when expanded, each term will have a combination of powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in other words, we're looking for all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) is 2 and the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything. So, that would correspond to the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, is that correct? Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the sum of all those coefficients, because each term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6.\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find all terms where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives us \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for each such term, we multiply by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because each term is multiplied by the binomial coefficient from the second expansion.\n\nWait, but \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too high. Let me check my reasoning again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misapplying the multiplication. Let me think differently. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since the two polynomials are in different variables, \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), the exponents don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nWait, that makes sense because when you have two polynomials multiplied together, and you want the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial, you can take that term's coefficient and multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial, since each term in the other polynomial can be paired with it. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nBut let me verify this by expanding both polynomials step by step. First, let's compute the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already did: \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nNext, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\).\n\nSo, all these terms have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from these terms. That is, \\(6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6\\).\n\nLet me calculate that: 6 + 36 is 42, plus 90 is 132, plus 120 is 252, plus 90 is 342, plus 36 is 378, plus 6 is 384. So, that confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in adding those numbers. Let me add them again step by step:\n\n- Start with 6 (from \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\))\n- Add 36: 6 + 36 = 42\n- Add 90: 42 + 90 = 132\n- Add 120: 132 + 120 = 252\n- Add 90: 252 + 90 = 342\n- Add 36: 342 + 36 = 378\n- Add 6: 378 + 6 = 384\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the coefficient is indeed 384.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a total sum of coefficients equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, when you multiply these two polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. That's a quicker way to get the same result.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that this approach is valid. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, in this case, substituting \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives us \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of the coefficients. Therefore, when we multiply the two polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, that seems consistent. Therefore, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check one more time by considering the general term in the product. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Each term in the second polynomial is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the total coefficient is the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial.\n\nSo, that again gives us 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\), then when you multiply them, the coefficients for the variables in different polynomials don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\n\nNext, we expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nThe sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\):\n\\[\n\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion:\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Let me write that out using the binomial theorem.\n\nSo, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), I get \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the entire product. That means I have to multiply the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) with the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nHmm, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply term by term. So, maybe I should think of it as each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) being multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that suggests that the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the \\(c\\) terms would affect the overall coefficient when considering the entire product.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part of the product involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because when you multiply those two terms together, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term, which is what we're interested in.\n\nAlright, so I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k}\\) which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me calculate it properly. \\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Hmm, but I think that's correct because \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is indeed 20.\n\nWait, actually, no, that's not right. Let me check again. \\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{(6)(6)} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients I found. So, that's 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we need to consider how \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product. \n\nWait, actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) appears without any \\(c\\) terms is if it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the product of the coefficients from each expansion, which is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply for the terms where the exponents add up correctly. So, in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, and the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\), so when you multiply, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so we need to find the coefficient when \\(k=0\\), i.e., when the second term is 1 (the constant term). So, that's why we multiply the coefficients from each expansion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies \\(c^0\\), we only consider the term where \\(k=0\\), which is the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not confusing anything here. Let me write it out more formally. The product is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{i=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{i} a^{4 - i}b^i\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - j} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^j\\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the second sum:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\n\\]\n\nNow, when we multiply these two sums together, each term is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{i} a^{4 - i}b^i \\times \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\n\\]\n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - i = 2\\) and \\(i = 2\\). So, for \\(i = 2\\), the coefficient from the first sum is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, we need the term from the second sum where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2j = 0\\), which gives \\(j = 3\\). The coefficient from the second sum when \\(j = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check my steps again.\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{j}c^{6 - 2j}\\).\n\n3. To get the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), set \\(6 - 2j = 0\\), so \\(j = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n4. Multiply the two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't see any mistakes in the logic or calculations. So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), and its coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{j=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - j} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^j = \\sum_{j=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2j = 0\\). Solving for \\(j\\), we get \\(j = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that as well.\n\nLet me think.

So, that would mean I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm thinking about this correctly. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient in the product as a whole, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so maybe the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would multiply.\n\nWait, no. Wait, no, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the terms multiply. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in one polynomial, and the other polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, each of which is a power of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by the second polynomial, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is not a term in the product unless it's multiplied by a term that's \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term because when you expand it, all the terms will have integer powers of \\(c\\), either positive or negative, but not zero. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) would be zero. That would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is zero. But that seems counterintuitive because I thought the coefficient was 6. Maybe I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me think again. So, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, you're effectively creating a product where each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only occur if the power of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in this case, the only term that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) is when it's multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20. So, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first expansion) times 20 (from the second expansion), which is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term, but actually, it does. Let me check that. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, we want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so 6 - 2k = 0. Solving for k, 6 = 2k => k = 3. So, the term when k=3 is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\times 1 = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is indeed 20. Therefore, when we multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term (which has a coefficient of 6) by this 20, we get 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my reasoning. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Then, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when we multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving a term \\(20a^2b^2\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, but the way the problem is phrased, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is if it's multiplied by a term that's \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because coefficients are specific to each term. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me think about the expansion more carefully. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. When I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) where k ranges from -6 to 6 in even steps. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't present unless multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it's just scaling by the entire second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that's not how coefficients work. Each term in the product is a combination of powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only appear in the product when multiplied by a term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are specific to each term. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me consider a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). So, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The term \\(a^1b^0\\) would have a coefficient of 1 in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), which is just 'a', then in the product, the terms would be \\(a \\times c = ac\\), \\(a \\times 1/c = a/c\\). So, the coefficient of 'a' (which is \\(a^1b^0c^0\\)) would be zero because there's no term without \\(c\\). Similarly, in the given problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present only when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which has a coefficient of 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but in my simple example, if I'm looking for the coefficient of 'a', it's zero because there's no term without \\(c\\). So, in the given problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because each term in the product includes powers of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have coefficients multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that it's considering the term without any \\(c\\) terms, i.e., \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in reality, each term in the product will have specific powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only appear in the product when it's multiplied by a term that has \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have some power of \\(c\\). So, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), but that's not standard. Typically, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product, it's in the context of all variables. So, if you're asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's assuming that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that's not how coefficients work. Each term is a combination of variables, so \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) is a distinct term for each \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would only be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Let me compute the product step by step. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when I multiply these two, each term in the first will be multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2/c^2\\), \\(36a^2b^2/c^4\\), and \\(6a^2b^2/c^6\\). So, the only term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is \\(120a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I've got it. The coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by the constant term (20) from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Let me write that out using the binomial theorem. \n\nSo, \\((a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Simplifying the coefficients, that becomes \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). Okay, so that's the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in this expansion is 6. So, does that mean the answer is 6? Wait, no, because the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how that multiplication affects the coefficient. \n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials together, the coefficients of the terms combine. However, in this case, the two parts of the expression are \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which are separate in terms of variables. So, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6, because when you multiply by the other part, which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it doesn't change the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? \n\nWait, let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, is that correct? \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because in the product, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which are terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), how does that work? \n\nWait, hold on, actually, no. The entire product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-m}\\) for various exponents \\(k\\) and \\(m\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without any \\(c\\) terms, would only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by 6, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part. So, let me compute that. \n\nFirst, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1 = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the constant term in the other expansion is 20, so when you multiply these two, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it as the product of two independent expansions. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Which is exactly what I did. \n\nLet me just confirm the binomial coefficients again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Correct. \n\nFor \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Correct. \n\nSo, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. \n\nWait, another way to think about it: the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all separate variables, the coefficients multiply when you're looking for a specific combination of variables. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so you only consider the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from the other expansion. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by every term in the second part, but since we only want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, but that's not correct because only the constant term in the second part will contribute to the term without \\(c\\). \n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about another approach. Suppose I consider the entire expression as a product of two independent polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since they are independent variables, the coefficients multiply when you take the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. Which is exactly what I did. \n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms} = 6a^2b^2 + \\dots\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).

Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, does that mean that when I multiply the two expressions, the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part?\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, wait, no. Because in the problem, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the second part could contribute other terms involving \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Or perhaps it's asking for the coefficient when considering all terms, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, actually, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire expression. So, perhaps I need to consider that when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that the coefficient is a constant. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Hmm, the problem statement isn't entirely clear, but perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would still be an expression in terms of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense for a coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, so the coefficient is just 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all terms, but perhaps the answer is just 6 multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so that the overall term is a constant. Let me check that.\n\nWait, if I think about it, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in one expression is multiplied by all terms in the other expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), meaning treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem.

But then, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because a coefficient should be a number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and since the other part is multiplied by it, but the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so maybe the answer is just 6. But that seems too simple, and I think the problem is more likely expecting me to consider the entire expression, so perhaps I need to compute the product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would still be 6 times the entire expansion, which isn't a single coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a bit strange because coefficients are usually numbers, not expressions. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so that the overall term is a constant. Let me check that.\n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\), and we want this to be zero. So, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion, then the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that's a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 120. Hmm, I think that's more likely because otherwise, the problem wouldn't make much sense. So, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me confirm. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when I multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\) is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion, but that's not a single number. So, I think the problem is more likely expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but without any mention of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems a bit strange because the coefficient is usually a scalar, not a polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a single coefficient. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), meaning treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, but that's not a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would be an infinite number of coefficients, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is: find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nBut that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion, but that's not a single number. Therefore, I think the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, let me check my steps again. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when I multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, including the constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), or specifically when \\(c^0\\)? The problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's just 6 times the entire expansion, but that's not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that \\(c\\) is another variable, and the coefficient is a polynomial, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but the problem is presented as a single coefficient, so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when \\(c\\) is set to 1, but that's not stated.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single number, so I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which seems odd.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would be 6 times each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120. So, the coefficient is 120. That seems more plausible because it's a single number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. So, I think the problem is more likely expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the product is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, each term in the product is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would correspond to all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that's not a single number, so perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\), but that would require more detailed computation. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is simply expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then leave it at that, but that seems too simple, and I think the problem is more involved.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the second part is a separate polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, so perhaps the problem is expecting me to express it as such, but the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, I'm a bit stuck here.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem says \"the coefficient\", which is usually a scalar, so that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, so maybe I should just write 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is simply expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then note that the other part is a separate polynomial, so the coefficient is 6 times that polynomial. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, but that would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, so perhaps the answer is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when \\(c\\) is set to 1, but that's not specified. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as I thought earlier.\n\nWait, to clarify, if I have the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{2}b^{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{n}\\), where \\(n\\) is some exponent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, I think it's more likely that it's expecting me to find the coefficient when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is 120.\n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that when finding the overall coefficient. Hmm, so I guess I need to multiply each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But I only care about the term where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\). That means, regardless of what's happening with the c terms, the a and b parts are fixed as \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I can separate the two parts. Let me think: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and then I need to multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part? But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the c terms. Wait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, perhaps it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, meaning that the c terms can be anything. So, in that case, the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, maybe I need to consider how the two expansions interact. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes only from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and any term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems too big, and the problem is probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, meaning that the c part can be anything, so the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is in terms of c, and the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the answer is just 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Let me check: the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting c = 1, so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of the two expansions. Since the two variables are separate, the a and b terms are independent of c. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, as I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when c=1, so \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, and when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial has terms in c, which are separate variables, so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second part). So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to think of the entire expression as a product, and when you look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part, because the second part doesn't affect the a and b terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in c, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some k, but the problem didn't specify, it just said \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's just 384. Wait, but let me check another way. Let me expand both parts and see. The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which we've expanded as \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that as well using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 + \\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 + \\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 + \\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 + \\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} + \\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} + \\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the coefficients:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\), so term is \\(c^6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\), term is \\(6c^4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\), term is \\(15c^2\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), term is \\(20c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\), term is \\(15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\), term is \\(6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\), term is \\(c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion is 6a^2b^2, and it will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of c, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when c=1, which is 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient being 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of c, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Yeah, that seems right. So, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that might not make sense.

Wait, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms, which are variables, so you can't have a numerical coefficient unless you're considering a specific power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. That would make sense. So, let me approach it that way.\n\nSo, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nTo do this, I can expand each part separately and then find the product terms that result in \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nFirst, let's expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. As I did before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNext, let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of the first will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the product term will be \\(6 a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, we're looking for the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, we need to find the value of \\(m\\) such that \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\).\n\nNow, the coefficient from the second expansion when \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(20 c^0\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient from the second expansion is 20.\n\nNow, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the coefficients from both expansions, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the entire expression being a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would be incorrect because each term in the product is a combination of terms from both expansions. But in reality, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we only consider the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, which as I found earlier, is when \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20, and then multiply by the coefficient from the first expansion, which is 6, giving 120.\n\nSo, I think the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the binomial coefficients.\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nFor \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where \\(c^0\\), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the coefficients from both expansions:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Let me write that out using the binomial theorem.\n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Simplifying those coefficients, that's \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. But wait, the original expression is multiplied by another term, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times whatever the coefficient is for the corresponding term in the second part. But hold on, actually, I'm not sure if that's correct because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would depend on the product of the coefficients from each part, but only when the variables match. But in this case, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so it doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will just be multiplied by each term in the second part, but since the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply by something, you're distributing it across all terms. But since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would just be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but the variables are different. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right either. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), its coefficient is 6, and when you multiply it by each term in the second expansion, each of those products will have a term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, no, that's not exactly right either. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, no. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the second expansion is of the form \\(k c^n\\) where \\(k\\) is the coefficient. Therefore, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(6k a^2b^2 c^n\\) and \\(6k a^2b^2 \\dfrac{1}{c}^m\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), contributes \\(6 \\times \\text{coefficient of } c^{\\text{something}}\\) to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, effectively, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me double-check that logic because I might be making a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that each term in the product is \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) multiplied by \\(c^m (1/c)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m - (6 - m)} = a^kb^{4 - k}c^{2m - 6}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the first part. So, for \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), as I found earlier. Then, for each term in the second part, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{m} (1/c)^{6 - m} = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{2m - 6}\\). So, when I multiply these together, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^{2m - 6}\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. So, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\), as before. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), with coefficient 6, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) would be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, as I calculated earlier, then the coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by another method. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the variables \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\) are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't quite make sense because the variables are different. Wait, no, actually, the variables are separate, so when you multiply, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would indeed be 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a simpler example to see if this logic holds. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the first part is 1, and the second part is \\(c + 1/c\\), whose sum of coefficients is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1*2=2. Let's check: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). Multiplying these, the term \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is \\(1 \\times (1 + 1) = 2\\), which matches. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2*(1 + 1)=4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1*(1 + 1)=2. So, yes, that seems to work. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a Laurent polynomial, meaning it can have negative exponents. But when I set \\(c=1\\), I get the sum of coefficients as 64, which is correct. So, the logic holds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two polynomials, one in \\(a, b\\) and the other in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term would be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, I think. But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), that corresponds to \\(k=2\\), so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you have two independent variables, the coefficient of a specific term in one variable is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial is the sum of all coefficients where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Wait, but that's a different approach. Let me see.\n\nWait, no, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's equivalent to considering that any term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), irrespective of the power of \\(c\\). So, in effect, it's the same as saying that for each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the coefficient of that term in the second expansion. Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. The sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so when you multiply by 6, you get 384. Alternatively, if I were to expand both parts and collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that there isn't a different approach where I have to consider the exponents of \\(c\\) as well. For instance, maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but the problem doesn't specify any exponent for \\(c\\), so it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\)'s exponent. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the sum over all possible exponents of \\(c\\) of the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product being equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the variables are independent, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but let me try to compute it another way to confirm. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me denote the first part as \\(P(a, b)\\) and the second part as \\(Q(c)\\). So, the product is \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\). Since \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\) are polynomials in different variables, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(P(a, b)\\), and since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\)'s exponent, it's the same as multiplying by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure that this is correct by considering a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the first part is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1*2=2. Let's check by expanding:\n\n\\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\)\n\\((c + 1/c) = c + 1/c\\)\nMultiplying these together:\n\\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\)\nWhich is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\)\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 (from \\(a^2c\\)) + 1 (from \\(a^2/c\\)) = 2, which matches our earlier calculation. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2 (from \\(2abc\\)) + 2 (from \\(2ab/c\\)) = 4, which is 2*2=4, again matching. The coefficient of \\(b^2\\) is 1 (from \\(b^2c\\)) + 1 (from \\(b^2/c\\)) = 2, which is 1*2=2. So, this method works.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that I'm misapplying the concept here? Because sometimes when variables are involved, you have to be careful about how they interact, but in this case, since \\(a, b, c\\) are all distinct variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term in \\(c\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of that term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\)'s exponent, it's the same as summing over all possible coefficients in the second expansion when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which gives 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me compute the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I did earlier, setting \\(c=1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when you have variables like \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the exponents can be negative, but in this case, when we set \\(c=1\\), we're effectively summing all the coefficients regardless of the exponent, which is what we need here.\n\nSo, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives the total coefficient as \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Let me think about expanding that. So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating those coefficients, that's \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that means I have to consider the product of these two expansions. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part, maybe the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part don't get affected by the second part? Let me think. So, when I multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. However, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents won't interfere with each other. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any other terms involving \\(c\\), perhaps I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the entire second part? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate expansion. Actually, when I multiply the two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the second expansion doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because the second expansion is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe it's just 6 times the entire second expansion? Wait, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps they're treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that's still a sum of terms with \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, and since the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simple. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, that might make sense. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each of those coefficients, resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times \\text{(coefficient from second expansion)} \\times a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, in effect, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Hmm, that seems plausible. Let me check that again. So, the first part's coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has various terms. Each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). The coefficient for each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), and the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But that sum is \\(6 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that's the coefficient. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) for some specific \\(m\\), then we would have to compute \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\) where \\(6 - 2k = m\\). But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\)? Or is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1? That would be different. So, if it's the latter, then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. Let me check that. So, in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\). So, I'm a bit confused. In algebra, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a term is the product of the coefficients from each part, considering the variables separately. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is not a single number, but a polynomial. However, the problem asks for the coefficient, which is typically a number. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the part of the product that involves \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 120. But the problem doesn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. If I expand the entire expression, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives terms up to \\(a^4b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives terms with various powers of \\(c\\). When you multiply them together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^{6}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{4}\\), down to \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{(6 - k)/2}\\), but only for even \\(k\\) where \\(6 - k\\) is even. So, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\). That is, 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), I think it's more likely the former. So, I think the answer is 384. But to make sure, let me check with an example. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\). Then the second part becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, so in the entire expression, it's 6 * 64 = 384. So, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, since the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to a sum of terms, the total coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Let me write that out using the binomial theorem.\n\nSo, \\((a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I have to consider that as well?\n\nHmm, I think so. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would depend on the coefficients from both expansions. But wait, I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part of the product involves \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms? Let me think about that.\n\nSo, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat the \\(c\\) part separately because the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are independent of \\(c\\). That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term is multiplied by each term, so actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a sum of terms, not just a single coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). So, the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) doesn't affect the exponent of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single coefficient. But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just 6 times the entire expression, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, actually, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interfere with the exponents of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because in the product, each term would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, each multiplied by the corresponding \\(c\\) terms.\n\nBut that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, but that doesn't seem right either. Maybe I'm supposed to treat the entire expression as a product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the combined expression, considering all possible terms. Wait, but in that case, the coefficient would involve terms with different powers of \\(c\\), which isn't a single coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is actually just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times a polynomial, which isn't a single number. Hmm, I'm confused.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and not the \\(c\\) parts, meaning that the coefficient is just 6, and the \\(c\\) part is separate. But that seems odd.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of the entire expression as a product, and when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the terms are in different variables, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all terms in the second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single coefficient. So, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are irrelevant. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something like that, but as it is, it's \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the answer is just 6, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that when you multiply the two polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. So, is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 384? Hmm, that seems plausible, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in each polynomial whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since the variables are different, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because for each term in the first polynomial, you're multiplying it by every term in the second polynomial, but since the variables are separate, the exponents don't interfere. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can substitute \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with another approach. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible coefficients from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. As we calculated earlier, that's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if we were to expand the entire product, each term would be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges based on the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in terms where \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient for each such term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^{m}\\) in the second polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\), which is equivalent to summing all coefficients in the second polynomial. Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\text{sum of coefficients in } \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me check this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2, which is correct because when you expand, you get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, same as \\(b\\). Similarly, if I take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^2\\), which is 4. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 4, which makes sense because when you expand, each \\(a^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient would be 1 * 4 = 4. So, this approach seems to work.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the sum of its coefficients. The binomial expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of the coefficients is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), and the sum is \\(2^6 = 64\\), as we had before. So, that confirms that the sum of the coefficients is indeed 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem**:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficient from step 1 by the sum from step 2**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer**: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. Okay, that part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the expression is multiplied by another part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I need to consider this as well because the entire expression is the product of these two expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, there are other terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).

Or are we supposed to consider the entire expression as a product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\)?\n\nWait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of that specific term, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the sum of the coefficients of each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the 6 from the first part. Wait, no, actually, I think it's more precise to say that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, actually, no. That's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first part, which is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times each term in the second expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is, the second expression has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so the overall expression will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, if we're only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But if the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific power of \\(c\\), then we would need to find that specific term.\n\nWait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's the total coefficient, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, it's the sum of all coefficients of terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are reciprocals, so their product would have a term where the exponents cancel out. Hmm, that might make sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6.\n\nLet me check. If the problem is from a textbook or something, sometimes they might consider the entire expression, including variables, but in this case, the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's just 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part. But wait, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which would give \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, which is 6a^2b^2, and then this is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing to the coefficient.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Because if the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), then when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would indeed be the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion multiplied by 6.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion and multiply it by 6.\n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, let's compute that.\n\nThe sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me verify this approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that each term in the product contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but only when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), then we need to find the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, i.e., \\(c^0\\).\n\nSo, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 120.\n\nWait, so now I'm confused because depending on the interpretation, the answer could be 384 or 120. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, in the entire expression, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems too large. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression, and \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of a term that also includes \\(c\\) terms, but the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, yes, it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to treat the entire expression as a polynomial in multiple variables and find the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum over all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about it another way. Suppose I expand the entire expression:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\n\\]\n\nSo, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems correct because each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by 6. So, the total coefficient is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^0\\), then we would have to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6*20=120.\n\nBut since the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's the total coefficient, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes problems like this might expect you to consider only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), but the problem didn't specify that. So, perhaps I should clarify.\n\nLet me think: if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means I'm looking for all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6*20=120.\n\nBut since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is the coefficient of \\(a\\) times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\) is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1*2=2. But in reality, the expansion is \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 for \\(ac\\) and 1 for \\(a/c\\), so total coefficient is 2, which matches 1*2=2.\n\nSimilarly, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\) would be 1*1=1, because only the term \\(ac\\) and \\(a/c\\) don't have \\(c^0\\). Wait, no, in this case, the term \\(a\\) times \\(c\\) is \\(ac\\), and \\(a\\) times \\(1/c\\) is \\(a/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a c^0\\) is zero because there's no term with \\(a\\) and \\(c^0\\). Wait, that's confusing.\n\nWait, in this small example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be the sum of coefficients of \\(a c^k\\) for all \\(k\\), which is 2. But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a c^0\\), that would be zero because there's no such term.\n\nBut in our original problem, the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, in the small example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is 2, which is the sum of coefficients in the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first expansion.\n\nSo, applying that logic, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Let me compute the sum of coefficients in the second expansion again. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and each term in the second expansion is multiplied by that, so the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that if we're looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. So, perhaps the problem is ambiguous. But given the wording, I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so 384.\n\nBut let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, since this term is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the total coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so I can't stop here. I need to consider the entire product. Now, I'm a bit confused. Do I need to multiply the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) with the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I don't need to multiply all the terms. Let me think. If I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then perhaps I just need the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, that doesn't make sense because the question is about a term in the product, so it's the product of two expressions. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve c, so when I multiply 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve c or 1/c. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". Hmm, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, if we're considering the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of c, but the problem doesn't specify anything about c. So perhaps the question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c. But that seems odd because in the product, each term would have both a and b parts and c parts. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think differently. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the expression is a product of two separate binomials, perhaps I can treat them separately. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Then, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded will have terms involving c^6, c^4, c^2, c^0, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve c, so when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it would become \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some k. So, unless we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just the constant term, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be a sum of terms involving c. But that doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a coefficient, which should be a numerical value, not a polynomial in c. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating c as a separate variable, but then the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in c. But that seems unlikely because the problem is presented as a single coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where a^2b^2 is multiplied by c^0. So, perhaps I should interpret the problem as asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Let me proceed under that assumption. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, I can consider the product as the product of two independent expansions. The first expansion gives me terms in a and b, and the second gives me terms in c and 1/c. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second expansion. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6 to get the final coefficient. So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of c to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for k, \\(6 = 2k\\) => \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming we're considering the term where c^0) is 120. Wait, but the problem didn't specify anything about c, so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the c terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in c, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial, not a single number. That doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^6\\), but that's just a guess. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating c as another variable, but then the coefficient would involve c terms, which doesn't seem likely. So, given the problem as stated, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   Setting the exponent equal to 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that should correspond to the term where \\(k = 2\\), right? Because in the binomial expansion, the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - k\\) and the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(k\\). So, when \\(k = 2\\), \\(a\\) will have exponent \\(2\\) and \\(b\\) will have exponent \\(2\\). \n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient for \\(k = 2\\), that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how the other part of the expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), affects the coefficient. \n\nHmm, how does multiplying two expressions affect the coefficients? I remember that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the resulting terms are products of coefficients from each polynomial. But in this case, the two expressions are separate: one is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, actually, they don't interfere with each other. That is, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are multiplied by all the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since they are separate variables, the coefficients should multiply accordingly. \n\nWait, but the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, actually, when we multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe we can consider that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the variables are different, the only way to get a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by the constant term (if any) from the second expansion. Because if you take any other term from the second expansion, you'll have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term attached, which would make the term in the product have variables \\(a^2b^2c^n\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^n\\), but not just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, so is there a constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? Let's check. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) will be \\(6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). So, the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). \n\nSo, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. \n\nSo, going back to the original expression, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Is there any other term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that could contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? For example, if I take \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by a term involving \\(c\\), say \\(c^k\\), then the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term would result in \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct because the second expansion isn't being summed; it's being multiplied term by term. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can consider that any term in the second expansion that isn't a constant would introduce a \\(c\\) term into the product, which we don't want. Therefore, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, to recap, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just confirm by perhaps expanding both expressions a bit more or checking with specific terms. \n\nFirst, let's confirm the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNext, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), let's write out the expansion:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is 20, as I found earlier.\n\nTherefore, when we multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But only the constant term (20) will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have additional factors of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6. \n\nWait, but the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider both parts. Because the coefficient we're looking for is in the product of these two expressions. So, it's not just about \\((a + b)^4\\), but also about how it interacts with \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nHmm, so maybe I should expand both parts separately and then look for the term that gives \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the ways that multiplying a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) with a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives me \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, hold on. The second expression has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so any term from the second expression would be a power of \\(c\\), either positive or negative. But the first expression only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when I multiply them together, the resulting term would have \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and some power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait a second, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would mean that in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) must come from the multiplication of terms where the \\(c\\) parts cancel out, or maybe they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, no, actually, no. Because the second part has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms involving \\(c\\), you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by 1, but since the second expression is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms with various powers of \\(c\\), including the constant term when the powers cancel out.\n\nWait, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read it. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term will have some power of \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), so the constant term in \\(c\\).\n\nOkay, so that's probably it. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, let me approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's expand \\((a + b)^4\\) as I did before, and we saw that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, which has a coefficient of 6, will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\) will give me \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). But since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Let's solve for \\(k\\): \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) implies \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k = 3\\) in the second expansion will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the first part.\n\nSo, the coefficient from the second expansion when \\(k = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20.\n\nTherefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion (with coefficient 6) by the term with \\(k = 3\\) from the second expansion (with coefficient 20). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms up to \\(a^4b^0\\) and down to \\(a^0b^4\\), and each term in between. Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion is 6, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\).\n\nSo, when I multiply 6 by each of these, I get terms like \\(6c^6\\), \\(36c^4\\), \\(90c^2\\), \\(120\\), \\(90c^{-2}\\), \\(36c^{-4}\\), and \\(6c^{-6}\\). So, the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) is 120, which comes from multiplying 6 by 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think that's 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything else. Are there other terms in the first expansion that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by terms from the second expansion? For example, if I take \\(a^3b\\) from the first expansion and multiply it by some term from the second expansion that has a negative exponent of \\(c\\), would that somehow result in \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, no, because when you multiply \\(a^3b\\) by a term with \\(c^{-k}\\), you still have \\(a^3b\\), which is \\(a^3b^1\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\). Similarly, if I take \\(a^4\\) and multiply by something, it would still have \\(a^4\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by the constant term from the second expansion. So, that's 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) again to make sure I got the coefficients right. So, when \\(k = 0\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\cdot c^6\\). When \\(k = 1\\), it's \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\). When \\(k = 2\\), it's \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\). When \\(k = 3\\), it's \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). When \\(k = 4\\), it's \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\). When \\(k = 5\\), it's \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\). When \\(k = 6\\), it's \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\). So, yes, the constant term is 20, so when multiplied by 6, it's 120.\n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using generating functions or considering the product as a whole. Alternatively, perhaps I can treat \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) as variables and consider how the terms multiply.\n\nWait, another approach: since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but in the problem statement, it's written as \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the constant term in \\(c\\). So, that's consistent with what I did before.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), that would be a different matter, but as it's written, I think it's safe to assume that it's the constant term in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is indeed only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering \\(c\\), but that seems a bit ambiguous because the entire expression includes \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the intended interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean summing over all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) power. But that seems unlikely because when you have multiple variables, the coefficients are usually considered with all variables accounted for.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to treat the entire expression as a product and find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that would be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), and the coefficient would be 120 as calculated before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so the product is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems consistent.\n\nWait, so maybe that's another way to look at it: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so when you multiply these two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense.\n\nSo, I think I've confirmed it multiple ways. The coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem to expand both parts separately.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6.\n\nNext, we expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\) gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
