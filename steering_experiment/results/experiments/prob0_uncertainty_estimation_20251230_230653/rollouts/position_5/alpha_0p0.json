    "text": " Let me write that out using the binomial theorem.\n\nSo, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), I get:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\n\nI need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, let's find the value of \\(k\\) that gives me \\(b^2\\). Since \\(b^k\\) is part of the expansion, if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(b^2\\) is the term. So, the corresponding term will be:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{4 - 2}b^2 = \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is the number of combinations of 4 things taken 2 at a time. That's 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression. But wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of the second part. But since I'm only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think that means the coefficient will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then any term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would have a different term. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, that term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first part and a term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, but I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. When you have two independent variables, like \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), then the terms in the product are independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and it would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6\\), since each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has coefficients that are binomial coefficients, and the sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. But wait, that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will contribute terms that are multiplied by this \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient; it's an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make sense because then we're looking for a specific term. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, that would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, let's break it down. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the product of the two coefficients we found, we multiply 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), giving us \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, so that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that we don't need to consider \\(c\\) at all. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression involves \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve all possible powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which isn't a single number. So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) occurs. That would make sense, and the coefficient would be 120.\n\nLet me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part, resulting in \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) with coefficient \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Since the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), but just asked for \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's implied that we consider all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which isn't a number. So, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's consider the expansion of the entire expression. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nWait, but let's think about it again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, that would mean considering all possible terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems more plausible if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\)'s exponent.\n\nWait, but I'm confused now. Let me try to clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would appear as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term, and that would be 120.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\)'s exponent. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which isn't a number. So, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), then in the product, it's the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier thought. Hmm. Let me clarify: The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), setting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of coefficients is 64, and 6 times 64 is 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n\nWait, that makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120. So, which one is it? Let me double-check.\n\nIf I consider the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. But if I consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times 64, which is 384. So, it depends on what the problem is asking. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean 384.\n\nWait, but in reality, in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a^k b^m c^n\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear multiplied by \\(c^n\\) for various \\(n\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't a single number but a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's a misinterpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, which is \\(c^0\\), so 6 times 20 is 120. That seems more plausible because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which isn't a single number.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^m c^n\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^n\\) for various \\(n\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but if I think about it, when you have two independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part. So, if you have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the product is a combination, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but that seems correct because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the product for every possible term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 120, considering only the \\(c^0\\) term. So, which is it? I think the confusion arises from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\) or specifically \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Since the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we have \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2, so 1*2=2. But in reality, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is 2, because it's \\(a(c + 1/c)\\), which is \\(ac + a/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 2 as well. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part. So, that seems to confirm that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still not entirely sure. Let me think about another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Expanding, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is 1 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2, so 1*2=2. But in reality, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, that contradicts the earlier idea. Therefore, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is not a number but a polynomial.\n\nWait, so that suggests that my earlier reasoning was incorrect. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is not a number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term, and that would be 120.\n\nWait, but in the example I just did, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), then it's a polynomial, which doesn't make sense for a numerical answer. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to clarify, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed a polynomial, which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, it's likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms up to \\(a^4b^0\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) varies from -6 to +6 in steps of 2. The term where \\(c^0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20. So, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Since the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), but just asked for \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's a misinterpretation, and the intended answer is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but that doesn't make sense for a numerical answer. Therefore, the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, after all this, I think the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the two coefficients:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Wait, but actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term because they are multiplied by different variables. Let me think about this.\n\nWhen you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any term involving \\(c\\), I might need to consider the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, actually, no. Because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is separate from the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But that doesn't seem right because the second part has terms with different powers of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify: when you have the product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) involve different variables, so when you multiply them, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are independent of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't sound quite right because each term in the second expression is multiplied by each term in the first, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't care about the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that might not be correct because each term in the second expression is multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but since the problem doesn't specify any variables involving \\(c\\), perhaps the answer is just the product of the coefficients, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand the entire product, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) come from the first part, and the terms involving \\(c\\) come from the second part. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they all result in terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part involves \\(c\\), which are different variables. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion would have multiple terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, but that's not quite accurate.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then the second part is a separate polynomial, so when you multiply, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that doesn't seem right because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's correct because I'm treating the second part as a separate polynomial and summing all its coefficients, then multiplying by the coefficient from the first part. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and since the variables are different, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just 6.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the entire expression is the product of two polynomials, so each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6, but that seems too simple. Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\", so it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But in the entire product, each term is of the form \\(a^k b^m c^n\\) or similar, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(c^k\\) with some coefficient. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) with coefficients being the product of 6 and the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. Because each term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) has a coefficient of 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c^k\\) terms would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6, but now I'm seeing that it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Let me verify this with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding this, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{0} = 1\\), and the second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1*(1 + 1) = 2, because each term in the second part is multiplied by 1. So, in this case, the coefficient is 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{1} = 2\\), and the total coefficient would be 2*(1 + 1) = 4. So, this seems to confirm that the coefficient of \\(a^kb^{4 -k}\\) in the product is the binomial coefficient times the sum of coefficients in the second part.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in one polynomial is multiplied by each term in the other polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient would be 6 times (1 + 1)^6, which is 6*64=384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

    "text": " Let me write that out using the binomial theorem. \n\nSo, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which means I need \\(a^2b^2\\). That would correspond to when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part. So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms won't interact with the \\(c\\) terms. That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from the first part, right? Because when you multiply by the second expansion, it's like multiplying each term by all the terms in the second expansion, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) won't change. \n\nWait, hold on, maybe I'm oversimplifying. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. So, does that mean we're looking for the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion? But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, no, I think I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial for the terms that multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from the second expansion multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some term in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms of the second expansion, but each of those terms has a \\(c\\) component. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without considering \\(c\\), is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that can't be right because the problem is probably expecting a specific number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is considering the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\) terms, but it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, it's treating the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But that seems unlikely because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term, it's in the entire expression, considering all variables. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when you multiply by the second part, which is in terms of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Wait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has coefficients. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\)? But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression is given. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). When you multiply them, the resulting expression will have terms like \\(a^kb^l c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^l c^{-m}\\). The problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, it's the sum of all coefficients where the term has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). \n\nSo, to find that, I need to take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes its own coefficient, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by all of them, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that is the product of the coefficients from each part. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion isn't a single coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps another approach: Let me think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. The first is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). When you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by each of the coefficients in the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it would be the sum of all those products. \n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I calculated before, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, which is 6. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is given. \n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is considering the entire expression, which includes both \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a distraction. But that seems odd because the problem includes both parts. \n\nWait, perhaps another approach: Let's consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is being multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would have a coefficient of 6 times 1, \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would have 6 times 6, \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) would have 6 times 15, \\(a^2b^2\\) would have 6 times 20, \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\) would have 6 times 15, \\(a^2b^2c^{-4}\\) would have 6 times 6, and \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\) would have 6 times 1. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term without any \\(c\\) component, i.e., \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6. \n\nSo, let's calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, that makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the term with \\(c^0\\), which is 20, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), so the coefficient is 120. \n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nLet me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. \n\n2. Then, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) because that's the term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms. \n\n3. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is found by setting the exponent to 0, which gives \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\n4. Multiply the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find the term in the second expansion that is a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will remain as \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. \n\nSo, perhaps I need to first find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, which is 6, to get the final coefficient. That makes sense because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second expansion, you just get \\(6 \\times\\) (constant term) times \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, let me work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's \\(6! / (3! \\cdot (6 - 3)!) = (720)/(6 \\cdot 6) = 720 / 36 = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20. So, when we multiply these two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait a second, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is it correct that I only need to consider the constant term in the second expansion? Because if I don't, and I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make the term not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, only the constant term from the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just recap to ensure I didn't skip any steps. I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, I considered the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and found its constant term by setting the exponent of \\(c\\) to zero, which gave me \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120, which is the coefficient we're looking for. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. It all seems to check out. So, yeah, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Let me expand that first.\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that becomes \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. But wait, that's just the first part. The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how that affects the coefficient.\n\nHmm, so I think I need to multiply each term from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to consider all the terms from the second expansion. Let me think. When I multiply the two expansions, the variables from each will multiply together. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which are in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, that seems confusing. How can a term not involve \\(c\\) when it's multiplied by something involving \\(c\\)?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's possible that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by a term that has \\(c^0\\), which would be 1, so that the resulting term is \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\), hence the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. Alternatively, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, but the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that's not possible because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term will have a power of \\(c\\), so the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me confirm that.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term in the expansion where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) in the second expansion cancel each other out.\n\nSo, let's break this down. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because when I multiply 6 by that coefficient, I will get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is what I want.\n\nSo, let me expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k}\\) which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the term that will give me \\(c^0\\). So, I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) and solve for \\(k\\). \n\n\\(6 - 2k = 0\\)  \nSubtract 6 from both sides:  \n\\(-2k = -6\\)  \nDivide both sides by -2:  \n\\(k = 3\\)\n\nSo, when \\(k = 3\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, when we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part (with coefficient 6) is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part (with coefficient 20). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Is that all? So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and \\(c^0\\) comes from the second expansion, so their product is \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expansion being the product of two polynomials. So, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since I'm only interested in the term where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the power of \\(c\\) is zero, I can focus on just those parts.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, because when you multiply them, you get the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) with the coefficient being the product. So, that's exactly what I did earlier. So, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nLet me just make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6, because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). And \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, because \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, those coefficients are correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there any other term in the second expansion that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by terms from the first expansion? For example, if the second expansion had a term with \\(c^k\\) and the first expansion had a term with \\(c^{-k}\\), but wait, no, because the first expansion doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. The first expansion is entirely in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when you multiply by the second expansion, which is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the resulting terms will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) powers along with \\(c\\) powers. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) power, that's not correct. Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, each term will have some power of \\(c\\). So, unless the problem is considering all terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be incorrect because the problem is about the coefficient in the entire product, which includes \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's possible that the problem is considering only the terms where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) in it, and the problem is asking for just \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). Therefore, it's implied that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as I calculated.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the answer would be different because each term in the product would have a power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would vary depending on the power of \\(c\\), so it wouldn't make sense to just ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion is 20.

    "text": " Let me expand that first.\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). Each term's coefficient is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\) where \\(k\\) is the power of \\(b\\). So, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of these two expansions. Wait, but the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), while the first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, the variables involved are different. That means that the coefficients from each expansion multiply each other, but since the variables are different, the terms won't interfere with each other. \n\nWait, let me think again. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I multiply them, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, the only way to get a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), any term from the second part will just be a coefficient multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, does that mean in the entire expanded product, or just in the part where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\)? Wait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in the first expansion, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion because each term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their own coefficients. \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. When I multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the variables are entirely separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as in the first polynomial, multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial has terms with \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5\\), etc., down to \\(c^{-6}\\), each of these will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^5\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the variables involved are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). But when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some combination of \\(c\\) terms. But in reality, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when we multiply by the second polynomial, which is in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial evaluated at the terms that don't involve \\(c\\), which is only the constant term. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct either. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute a term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without any \\(c\\) terms, would only come from the constant term in the second polynomial. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's equivalent to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, which is the term we're interested in. Any other term from the second polynomial would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would change the term to something like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found to be 6, and then multiply it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nNow, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first polynomial) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second polynomial). So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nWait, but let me just make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), 1, \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), etc. \n\nBut when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would actually include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But in reality, the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). If that's the case, then we only consider the constant term in the second polynomial. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that we're looking for all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. But that doesn't make much sense because the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial would be when \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that. \n\nIf I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any power of \\(c\\). In polynomial expressions, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a specific term refers to the numerical factor in front of that term, regardless of other variables. So, for example, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2c^3\\) would have a coefficient, and \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient as well, but only if it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\). \n\nWait, but actually, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear as a standalone term if it's multiplied by the constant term from the second polynomial. Otherwise, it's multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, that would only come from the term where the second polynomial contributes a constant. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it refers to the constant term in \\(c\\). So, I think the correct answer is 120. \n\nWait, but to make sure, let me think about how the product works. The product of two polynomials is such that each term is a product of terms from each polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and a term in the second polynomial that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But since the second polynomial is in \\(c\\), the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is the constant term. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me confirm by another approach. Suppose I consider the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The expansion of this product will have terms like \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. The coefficient of each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m/2}\\) if \\(m\\) is even, otherwise zero. \n\nNow, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient from the first polynomial is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for the second polynomial, I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which as we found earlier is 20. So, the overall coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product as \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Let me expand that first.\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), using the binomial theorem, it would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that's \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6. Got that part.\n\nNow, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I have to consider the entire expression, not just \\((a + b)^4\\). That means I need to multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I'm wondering, does the multiplication with \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or is it just a separate part?\n\nLet me think. The expression is a product of two separate binomials: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, when I multiply them out, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. However, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all separate variables, the terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't combine with terms with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in that expansion would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, the specific term is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), any term multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) will result in a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, but in the product, it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). So, actually, there's no term in the product that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is zero? But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient, implying it's non-zero. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, maybe they are treating the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and they want the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct either because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a specific power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives the sum of coefficients. So, let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, let's find the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I set \\(c = 1\\), then the expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 64 (the sum of coefficients from the other part). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But no, because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each of those terms has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those coefficients becomes part of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, that can't be because in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms in the other expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) times 6. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, making \\(c^0\\), so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). In that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that.\n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, so the total coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct? Let me think about what the problem is asking. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). But in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is the constant term, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, as I calculated earlier. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that all terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but actually, no. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply it by any term from the other expansion, it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms doesn't exist in the product unless \\(k = 0\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is only the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", not \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)\". So, does that mean it's considering all terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? Or does it mean the coefficient of the term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require the \\(c\\) terms to cancel out?\n\nI think it's the latter. Because in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only exist if it's multiplied by a term that has \\(c^0\\), otherwise, it would have some power of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's likely referring to the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, meaning the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Suppose I expand the entire product, \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear in the product if it's multiplied by a term that has \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, you'd have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the other expansion, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would give a coefficient of 6 * 64 = 384. But I think that's not the case because when you have multiple variables, the coefficient is usually considered in the context of all variables. So, if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you have to consider that it's multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the other expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems contradictory because in reality, each term in the product has specific exponents for each variable. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the other expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of the coefficients of all terms \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any integer \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)) = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 120. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). If the problem is considering only the term where \\(c\\) is also squared or something, but no, it's not specified. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear with any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the other expansion multiplied by 6. So, that would be 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think differently. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), I'm not sure. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's considering all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) terms. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the other expansion, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a scalar, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm mixing things up. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, and the coefficients add up for like terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in \\((a + b)^4\\) that multiply to give \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficients of terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in the other expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me think differently. Suppose I expand both parts:\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^5 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c} + 15c^4 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 20c^3 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^3} + 15c^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^4} + 6c \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^5} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\).\n\nSimplifying the second expansion: \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), that coefficient becomes part of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in reality, there is no single term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product; instead, there are multiple terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Therefore, 6 * (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems like the coefficient is 384, but that would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being treated as a single term, which it's not. Each multiplication results in a different term with different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is misworded, or I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's more likely what the problem is asking because otherwise, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a sum over multiple terms, which isn't standard. So, I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nLet me confirm this. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the product becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But if I set \\(c = 1\\), I'm effectively looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all powers of \\(c\\). So, that would give 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I set \\(c\\) such that the exponents cancel, but that's not standard. Usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product, you consider the term as it appears, regardless of other variables. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear with any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the other expansion multiplied by 6. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still confused because when you have multiple variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't a single term; it's a term multiplied by other variables. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a scalar. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a scalar.\n\nWait, I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me clarify: when you have a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's actually part of a larger term that includes \\(c\\) raised to some power. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the sum of all coefficients from the other expansion multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me think differently. Suppose I consider the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). Then, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear in multiple terms, each with different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of the coefficients of all terms \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any integer \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)) = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120. I think I was confusing the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) with just \\(a^2b^2\\). But in reality, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which means it's the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nLet me confirm this by another method. The entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would be 6 * \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But when you expand that, each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by 6, becomes part of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all those coefficients, which is 6 * (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)) = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is only affected by the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we consider the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

So when I multiply the two expressions together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), the other part doesn't affect it. \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check. If I have two separate variables, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), which is another variable, then when I multiply the two expressions, the terms will be products of terms from each expansion. So, for example, a term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to various terms involving \\(c\\), the resulting term will be \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". But in the entire expression, each term is a product of powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, does the problem mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), or specifically \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific power of \\(c\\)? \n\nWait, the problem is stated as: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's a bit ambiguous. But I think, in such problems, unless specified, they usually mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But wait, actually, no. Because in the entire expression, the terms are products of \\(a^kb^l c^m\\). So, if we are to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would be the sum of all coefficients where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). \n\nBut that seems a bit odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all the possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2 c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be accompanied by some power of \\(c\\), but since the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nBut that seems a bit off because, in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we have to consider all terms where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is raised to any power. So, the coefficient would be the sum of all such coefficients from the product. \n\nWait, but that might not be necessary. Alternatively, since \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would still leave the coefficient as a function of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical. \n\nI think I must be misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not stated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the part \\((a + b)^4\\) and ignoring the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part, but that seems unlikely. \n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product, and when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can treat the other part as constants. So, for example, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6 \\), then when expanding, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a numerical coefficient. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that seems unclear. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would just be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I multiply 6 by 64, I get 384. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms. So, each term in the product is a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is not a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. \n\nI think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let's consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it would produce terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(terms in }c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems incorrect because coefficients are numerical. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient, so maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then considering that the other part doesn't affect it. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think of it as two separate expansions. The first expansion is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I multiply them together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but considering that \\(c\\) is a variable, so the coefficient is a polynomial. But the problem didn't specify that, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is just part of the expression, so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simple. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but again, that's a polynomial, not a number. \n\nI'm getting confused. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me consider specific terms. In \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms like \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTherefore, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). \n\nSo, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 36, and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the coefficient when the power of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. \n\nWait, that makes sense! Because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, I need to find the term in the expansion where \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, first, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nFrom earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in the other expansion is 20. So, multiplying them together, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, so that means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Let me check that again. \n\nYes, because in the product, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) term is when we multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. All other terms would have some power of \\(c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. \n\nSo, the coefficient is indeed \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nI think that makes sense now. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients found:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Let me write that out.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Simplifying the binomial coefficients, that becomes \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by another term, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire product. Hmm, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would depend on the coefficients from both expansions. \n\nLet me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part, which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\); I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. \n\nWait, is that right? Let me make sure. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will have a factor of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't sound quite right. Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, you'll get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(6a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would be the sum of all those coefficients. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). Because when \\(c = 1\\), each term becomes just its coefficient. So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. \n\nSo, then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check my reasoning again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is a product of two polynomials. So, actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and since the second part is multiplied by it, but it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, only the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But when you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, you have to consider that each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems correct. Let me think again. If I have two expressions, say, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the coefficient of a certain term in P(a, b) * Q(c) is just the coefficient in P(a, b) times the sum of the coefficients in Q(c). Because when you multiply, each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q, so the coefficient of a specific term in P gets multiplied by each term in Q, so when you collect like terms for the specific term in P, you sum all the coefficients from Q. \n\nSo, in this case, P(a, b) is \\((a + b)^4\\), and Q(c) is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in Q(c) is 64, as calculated before. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check this another way. Suppose I expand both expressions fully. The first expansion has terms up to \\(a^4b^4\\), but specifically, \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. The second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), with various coefficients. Each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the coefficient 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression and the sum of the coefficients in the second expression. That seems to make sense. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the exponents of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But when you're looking for the coefficient, you have to consider that the second polynomial contributes a factor that's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to be more precise, I could think of the product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut let me confirm this by considering a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^1\\) is \\(a + b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) is 1. The expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), so the sum of its coefficients is 1 + 1 = 2. Now, the product would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1 times (c + 1/c), so the coefficient is 1*1 + 1*1 = 2? Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, actually, in the product, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^1\\) would be 1*1, and the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^{-1}\\) would be 1*1. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1c^1\\) would be 1*1, and the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1c^{-1}\\) would be 1*1. So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product is the sum of the coefficients of \\(a^1b^0c^k\\) for all k, which is 1*1 + 1*1 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would be 2. \n\nSo, in this simple case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product is indeed 2, which is 1 (the coefficient in the first polynomial) multiplied by 2 (the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial). So, that seems to confirm my reasoning earlier. \n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 6 (the coefficient from the first polynomial) multiplied by 64 (the sum of coefficients from the second polynomial), which is 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c=1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). That's correct. \n\nAlternatively, I could have thought of it as the sum of the binomial coefficients for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 2^6=64. So, that's correct. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but let me double-check this. Another way to approach this problem is to consider that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the exponents don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to write out the entire expansion, it would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^5\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right) + 15c^4\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^2 + 20c^3\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^3 + 15c^2\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^4 + 6c\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^5 + \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\n\\]\nSimplifying that, it becomes:\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\nSo, the sum of the coefficients is indeed 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64, as before.\n\nTherefore, when I multiply each term in the first expansion by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that each term in the product will have the form \\(a^k b^m c^n\\), where k + m =4 and n ranges from -6 to 6. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to k=2 and m=2, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second polynomial. But when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's equivalent to multiplying 6 by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to consider just the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, and then multiply it by the entire second expansion, the result would be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but I think I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is that when you have two independent variables, the coefficient of a specific term in one variable is the product of the coefficient in that variable's expansion and the sum of coefficients in the other variable's expansion. So, in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient in the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Recognize that the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a sum of coefficients equal to 64 (found by setting \\(c=1\\)).\n\n3. Multiply these two results together: 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make absolutely sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculation. Let me recalculate the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nThe sum of coefficients is found by substituting \\(c=1\\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 6 * 64 is indeed 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to think about the entire expansion, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Let me write that out.\n\nExpanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem would give me terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\), and so on, up to \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can focus on the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be the third term in the expansion, right? So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, that's just the first part of the expression. The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the entire product when finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but hold on. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so maybe those terms won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term directly. Or do they? Let me think. When you multiply two polynomials together, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to see if any of those multiplications would result in another \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But wait, no, because the second polynomial only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by terms that have \\(c\\) raised to some power, but that won't change the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply as well. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me clarify.\n\nWhen you have two polynomials multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(P(a, b)\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(Q(c)\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\) for various exponents \\(k\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or anything else, I think that term doesn't exist in the product because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero? That seems odd. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are all different. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part, which are all in terms of \\(c\\). Therefore, the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but there won't be any term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero? Hmm, that seems correct, but maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so each term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, unless \\(k = 0\\), which would mean the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\), but in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), is there a constant term? Let me check that.\n\nYes, when you expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), there should be a term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, resulting in a constant term. So, let me find that term. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which means \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in a term \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 20 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found earlier to be 6. So, 20 times 6 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Let me check another way. Maybe I can consider the entire expansion.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since these are two separate variables, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiplying it by the constant term from the second part. Because if you take any other term from the second part, you'd introduce a power of \\(c\\), which would make the term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term from the second part would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial expansion, as I did before, when \\(k = 3\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{6 - 2*3} = 20c^0 = 20\\). So, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nThe constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nWhen we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part? Because the second part doesn't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), only the powers of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, when I expand both parts, I need to find all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. Since the second part of the product doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by any term from the second expansion. But since the second expansion is multiplied entirely, the coefficient will be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, no, that's not right. Because the entire second part is a polynomial, so when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can consider that any term in the second expansion will just be multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient in the first part, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have a term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then I multiply it by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the resulting term will be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, actually, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the resulting terms will all have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without any \\(c\\) terms, would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the sum of coefficients in the second part would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384? Hmm, but that seems too high. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're actually creating terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) by itself, without any \\(c\\) terms, would only come from the part where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if you have \\(c^0\\), then it's just a constant. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the term with \\(c^0\\), you get \\(6a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone.\n\nSo, that makes more sense. Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, so is that the final answer? Let me just double-check my reasoning. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part, when multiplied, adds a factor that is the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) contributes to the coefficient without any \\(c\\) terms. So, yeah, 120 should be the coefficient.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we start by expanding each part separately using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\n\\]\nCalculating the coefficients, we get:\n\\[\n1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering all variables together, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms that have \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, regardless of the second part.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would combine. Let me think again. When you have two separate polynomials multiplied together, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But since the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second polynomial involves \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is not a number but an expression. That doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something here. Perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by whatever the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. But that doesn't seem right either because the coefficients in the second polynomial involve \\(c\\), so they wouldn't just add up to a number.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it differently. The entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand both parts separately, then each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), ..., \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the product as \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), ..., \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but the sum of all the coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (the sum of the coefficients in the second part), which is 384. Is that correct?\n\nWait, let me check that again. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in this part is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, when I multiply the two polynomials together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. That seems to make sense.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiplying it by any term from the second part. Since the second part has multiple terms, each with their own coefficients, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think about it another way. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because for each term in Q(c), when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term in Q(c). But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c, the coefficient would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in Q(c)).\n\nWait, but actually, that's not quite right. Because in the product, each term is a product of a term from P and a term from Q. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in Q, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) has coefficient 6 * 1, \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) has coefficient 6 * 6, \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) has coefficient 6 * 15, \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) has coefficient 6 * 20, \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\) has coefficient 6 * 15, \\(a^2b^2c^{-4}\\) has coefficient 6 * 6, and \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\) has coefficient 6 * 1. So, each of these terms would have coefficients as follows:\n\n- \\(a^2b^2c^6\\): 6 * 1 = 6\n- \\(a^2b^2c^4\\): 6 * 6 = 36\n- \\(a^2b^2c^2\\): 6 * 15 = 90\n- \\(a^2b^2c^0\\): 6 * 20 = 120\n- \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\): 6 * 15 = 90\n- \\(a^2b^2c^{-4}\\): 6 * 6 = 36\n- \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\): 6 * 1 = 6\n\nNow, if the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c, then we would sum all these coefficients because each of these terms includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of c. So, adding them up: 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6. Let me compute that:\n\n6 + 36 = 42\n42 + 90 = 132\n132 + 120 = 252\n252 + 90 = 342\n342 + 36 = 378\n378 + 6 = 384\n\nSo, that's 384. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to realize that when you have two independent variables, the coefficient of a specific combination of variables from the first polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial. So, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, that's consistent.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that's correct. So, in the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when \\(c = 1\\), it's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all its coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

That was straightforward. Now, the tricky part is that this expansion is multiplied by another expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), their exponents won't be affected by the terms involving \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is just a term in the first expansion. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion will combine with every term in the second expansion, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), does that mean I just need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and then multiply it by the entire second part? Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expression. But wait, no, that can't be right because the second expression isn't a constant. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that's not exactly correct because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can treat the second part as a single term with its own coefficient. But actually, no, because the second part is a sum of terms, each of which is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire second expression, the result is \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expression, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expression. But that seems off because the second expression isn't a constant. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with those of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) isn't a single number; it's a sum of terms. Wait, no, actually, when you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you're considering all possible terms in the product where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will contribute its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and since we're summing over all possible coefficients, that's equivalent to multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression.\n\nWait, but actually, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into the expression gives the sum of all coefficients. So, let me calculate that. \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384, but perhaps the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would indeed be 384. But let me think again. If the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^0\\), then we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would require a different approach.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that means we need to consider all terms in the product where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, and sum their coefficients, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not missing something. Another way to approach this is to consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. However, in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one polynomial and \\(c\\) is in the other, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute its own coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nTo confirm, let's think about it this way: when you expand the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. Each of those terms has a coefficient, and since we're summing over all possible terms in the second part, the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives us 64, as I calculated earlier, then yes, 6 * 64 = 384 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to see this is to recognize that \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be written as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by this sum, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the sum. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by each coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. Therefore, it's 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k=0\\) to \\(k=6\\), which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384, since the sum of binomial coefficients for a given \\(n\\) is \\(2^n\\).\n\nSo, yes, I think that confirms it. The coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by any term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the second part isn't a constant; it's a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\).

But that would mean that the coefficient isn't just 6, but 6 times something else. Wait, but no, because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 * 64 = 384? That seems high, but let me check.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm making a mistake here. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term's coefficient contributes to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). \n\nBut wait, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think again. Is that correct? Because when you expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, let me verify this because I might be confusing something. Alternatively, maybe the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by the second expansion, it's just 6 times the entire expansion, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's (a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c. The coefficient of \\(a b\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a b\\) term. But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it would be c + 1/c, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is (c + 1/c). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also (c + 1/c). But in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is not a number but a polynomial in c. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is not just a number but a polynomial in c. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which might mean the numerical coefficient, treating c as a variable. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c, so that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the coefficient can be a polynomial, but in this case, the problem is just asking for the coefficient, so it's probably 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we saw earlier. Now, when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms involving \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each of these terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1, so setting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because in the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because when you multiply by the second polynomial, each term in the first is scaled by each term in the second, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) is a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\). When you multiply them together, the resulting polynomial will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{-m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product with coefficients multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product being the sum over all possible combinations, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Let's take a simpler case where we have \\((a + b)^2 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). So, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). Now, the product is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be \\(1 * (c + 1/c)\\), so the coefficient is \\(c + 1/c\\). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be \\(2(c + 1/c)\\), and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be \\(1(c + 1/c)\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. So, applying this to our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. When multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is \\(64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Calculating those coefficients, \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\), and \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\). So, the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nAlright, so I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which from the expansion above is 6. But wait, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider both parts of the expression. Let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of these two expansions. \n\nWait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think about that. \n\nWhen I multiply two expressions together, the coefficients of the terms in the product are obtained by multiplying each term from the first expression by each term from the second expression. So, if I'm looking for a term that only has \\(a^2b^2\\), then that term must come from multiplying the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by a term in the second expansion that is a constant (i.e., doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\)). \n\nBut wait, does \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) have a constant term? Let me check. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nNow, for this term to be a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), the exponent of \\(c\\) must be zero. So, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the second expansion has a constant term of 20. \n\nTherefore, when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by 20 from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part gives me \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives me a constant term of 20, so when I multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term becomes \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it another way. Since the two expansions are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that's 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me confirm that there are no other terms in the second expansion that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by terms from the first expansion. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from the second expansion that has a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would introduce a factor that isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term from the second expansion can multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion to give a term that is purely \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, I think my reasoning is correct. The coefficient is 120. Let me just write that down as the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nThe constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nWhen multiplying the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

But wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nHmm, so when I multiply two expressions together, the coefficients of the terms combine. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I realize that any terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That is, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, the resulting term will still be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean I just need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part? Because when you multiply by the second expansion, it's like multiplying by 1 in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Hmm, no, that doesn't quite make sense. Let me think again.\n\nActually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, and the coefficients are multiplied together. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), then each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we need to find all the ways that when multiplying terms from both expansions, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts result in \\(a^2b^2\\), and then sum up the coefficients from those products. However, since the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts in the second expansion are zero. So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion isn't affected by the second expansion in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when I multiply it by any term from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term involving \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), that means we need to consider all possible coefficients from the second expansion and multiply them by the coefficient from the first expansion. \n\nWait, that doesn't seem right either because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to different terms in the final expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean we need to sum up all the coefficients from the second expansion and then multiply by the coefficient from the first part. Because each term in the second expansion is a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they just scale the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, let me clarify. Let me denote \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the product \\(A \\times B\\) will have terms where each term from \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(B\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is 6, and when multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), it becomes \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, in the product \\(A \\times B\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have coefficients from each term in \\(B\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nBut wait, let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(B\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). So, when I multiply \\(A\\) by \\(B\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the coefficient in \\(A\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\(B\\), which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), because when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), \\(k = 3\\). Wait, but that's only if we were looking for the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). But the problem isn't specifying any condition on \\(c\\); it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we need to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and sum their coefficients? \n\nWait, but when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of the terms that combine to form that specific term. So, in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\(A\\), and when you multiply by each term in \\(B\\), which is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), the resulting term is \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), because each term in \\(B\\) contributes a factor of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but that would be \\(6 \\times ( \\dbinom{6}{0} + \\dbinom{6}{1} + \\dbinom{6}{2} + \\dbinom{6}{3} + \\dbinom{6}{4} + \\dbinom{6}{5} + \\dbinom{6}{6}) \\). But the sum of all binomial coefficients for \\(n = 6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, that brings us back to 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nBut earlier, I thought maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but it's not. It's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that all the terms in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is indeed 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me verify this with another approach. Alternatively, I can consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term in \\(B\\) will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term of the form \\(a^2b^2c^{k}\\) for some \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients from \\(B\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(A\\). \n\nSo, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\) is 64, the total coefficient is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to think of it as combining the two expansions separately, since \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). That makes sense because each term in \\(B\\) scales the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) by its own coefficient. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me double-check the calculations. The sum of the coefficients in \\(B\\) is indeed \\(2^6 = 64\\), because \\(B = (c + 1/c)^6\\), and when \\(c = 1\\), it becomes \\(2^6 = 64\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is 6, as we calculated earlier. So, 6 \u00d7 64 is 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to think about it as generating functions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient in \\(A\\) and the sum of coefficients in \\(B\\), which is again 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 384. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\n\nThe expansion is:\n\n\\[\na^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Calculating the coefficients, that becomes \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient we just found. Wait, but actually, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, does that mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by the entire second expansion? Or do I need to consider terms in the second expansion that might combine with \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term that includes only \\(a^2b^2\\) and some powers of c? Hmm, I think it's the latter because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of c. So, in other words, any term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of c will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, no, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, and when multiplied by other terms from the second expansion, it will become \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of c. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the 6 we found earlier. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which means any term that has exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) and any power of c. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient for each such term in the product will be 6 times the coefficient of each term in the second expansion. But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of c, we can sum all those contributions. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nNow, how do we find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I substitute c = 1 into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that reasoning. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6a^2b^2. Then, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of the second part will be multiplied by 6a^2b^2, resulting in terms like 6a^2b^2c^k for various exponents k. So, each of these terms contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product because they all have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of c. Therefore, the total coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is present only in the first polynomial, and any term from the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will result in a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of c, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have (a + b)^1 * (c + 1/c)^1. The coefficient of a^2b^2 would be zero because in (a + b)^1, the highest power is a^1b^0 and a^0b^1. So, there's no a^2b^2 term. Wait, but in the original problem, it's (a + b)^4, so maybe that's a different case.\n\nWait, no, in the original problem, we're looking for a^2b^2, which exists in (a + b)^4, so that's fine. But in a simpler case, say, (a + b)^2 * (c + 1/c)^2, what would the coefficient of a^2b^2 be? In (a + b)^2, the coefficient of a^2b^2 is zero because (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2. So, there's no a^2b^2 term. Wait, so in that case, the coefficient would be zero, but according to my earlier reasoning, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum from the second part. But in this case, the coefficient from the first part is zero, so the total would be zero, which is correct.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the coefficient from the first part is 6, so 6 times 64 gives 384, which seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being (a + b)^4 times (c + 1/c)^6, and when expanding, each term will be of the form (coefficient from first part) * (coefficient from second part) times a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m} where m is some exponent. So, the term a^2b^2 would come from k=2 in the first part, which is 6, and then any term from the second part, which is (c + 1/c)^6. So, when you multiply 6a^2b^2 by each term in the second expansion, you get 6 times each coefficient of the second expansion times a^2b^2c^{m}. Therefore, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Maybe I can compute the product directly, but that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can think about the multinomial theorem or generating functions, but perhaps that's overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, another way: when you have two independent polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the term a^2b^2 is present only in the first polynomial, and any term in the second polynomial will contribute to the coefficient of a^2b^2 when multiplied by a^2b^2. So, the total coefficient is the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial again. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting c = 1, so it's \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's the answer. So, the final answer is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the sum of coefficients from the second expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Let me write that out using the binomial theorem.\n\nSo, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), it would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). \n\nWait, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I think I need to consider how the terms from each expansion multiply together.\n\nLet me think about how the two expansions interact. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, has terms involving different powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving different powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term will only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and some term in the second expansion. Because when you multiply two terms together, their variables multiply as well. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so maybe the problem is actually looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the way it's written, it just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which suggests that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some expression involving \\(c\\), and we need to find the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Or maybe the problem is considering \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) all as separate variables, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit odd because the problem didn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me try a different approach. When you multiply two expressions together, the terms combine. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would come from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit strange because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that seems like it's treating \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term, which it's not because \\(c\\) is another variable.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be \\(6\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(6 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. So, that can't be right.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). Because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a specific term. That makes more sense. So, let me try that approach.\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can consider the product of the coefficients from each expansion. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when \\(k = 3\\), because \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{6-3} \\times (1/c)^3 = \\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm doing this right. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), as I thought. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the \\(c^0\\) term, is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nBut wait, is that the only term contributing to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which includes terms with \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), down to \\(c^{-6}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would vary depending on the power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating again. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), as I thought earlier. So, in that case, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms up to \\(a^4b^0\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives terms with various powers of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., down to \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be a sum over all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each multiplied by 6. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to \\(6 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, that can't be what the problem is asking for.\n\nTherefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). So, as I calculated earlier, that coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. If I consider the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific power of \\(c\\), perhaps \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that seems impossible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of a larger expression that includes \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the problem is actually miswritten, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense in this context. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120, assuming that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nWait, let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the problem is considering that \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate term, and the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify that, so I think the intended answer is 120, considering the constant term in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but let me check the math again. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering the constant term in \\(c\\), is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we also need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nI think the key here is that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), their exponents won't be affected by the second part, which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). That means, when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), I actually need to find the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, it will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 multiplied by that constant term.\n\nSo, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this part. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term in the expansion has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0 because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\\\\n2k = 6 \\\\\nk = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nWait, hold on, that can't be right. Let me recalculate \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nWait, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 \u00d7 6) is 720 / 36, which is indeed 20. So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second expansion). \n\nSo, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I'm making a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it gets multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), we have to consider that when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have different powers of \\(c\\). However, the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). \n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but each of those terms has \\(c\\) raised to some power. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will actually be the sum of the coefficients of each term in the second expansion multiplied by 6, but wait, no, that's not correct. \n\nWait, no. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is independent of \\(c\\). So, when multiplied by the second polynomial, each term in the second polynomial will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), but each of these will be separate terms in the product. \n\nHowever, the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That is, when you expand everything, how much does \\(a^2b^2\\) get multiplied by? But in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each of which has some power of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself will have coefficients multiplied by each term in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the way the problem is phrased, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). However, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the sum of the coefficients of each term in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut that can't be right because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times a term with \\(c\\). So, actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a single term in the product, and its coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense either.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since these are two separate polynomials, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). \n\nSo, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, I get terms like \\(20a^2b^2\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, because any other term would have a power of \\(c\\), making it a different term. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), that term becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only term in the product that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) is when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second expansion), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is formed only when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term from the second part. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Maybe using generating functions or considering the entire expansion. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a, b\\) and the other in \\(c, 1/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial has terms with \\(c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) remains as \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is if it's multiplied by the constant term. So, that again leads me to 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by the constant term from the second polynomial. So, that confirms it again.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident now that the coefficient is 120. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) to find the constant term, which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together because the constant term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n4. 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nThe constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\) gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient of this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). Okay, so if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that's 6. But wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that as well.\n\nHmm, so the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think that means when I expand the whole thing, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to consider all the terms involving \\(c\\). Let me think.\n\nWait, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), right? So, when I multiply it by the other expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by each term of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I need to consider the entire coefficient, including the part from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, actually, I think the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Or does it? Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" Hmm, so it's a bit ambiguous. Is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), or just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\)? I think it's the former because otherwise, if it's regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6, as in \\((a + b)^4\\). But since the expression is multiplied by another term, maybe the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term from the other expansion. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so perhaps when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe it's just 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because then it's not a coefficient anymore.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part is multiplied by it, but it's a different variable. Wait, but the variables are different, so maybe the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all variables. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would just be 6, as in the first part. But that seems too simple, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, which would include terms from both expansions. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the first part, and the second part would multiply it by each of its terms.

So, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's just written as \\(a^2b^2\\), which might imply any power of \\(c\\). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems more likely. Wait, but the problem is written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which suggests that it's considering all possible terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem right because coefficients are usually scalars.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all terms from both expansions.

But that seems incorrect because the coefficient should be a scalar, not a polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering only the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, which would be 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems too simple, and the presence of the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) makes me think that the problem is more involved.\n\nWait, maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire expansion and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a scalar. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all terms, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, as I thought earlier, giving 384.\n\nBut let me verify that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. So, the final answer would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's what the problem is asking for because it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are scalars.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. In that case, I would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, multiply it by 6, and that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That makes more sense because then the coefficient would be a scalar.\n\nSo, let's try that approach. First, find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\times 1 = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) (which is 20) from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But if it's \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Given that the problem is written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, giving 384. But earlier, I thought it might be 120 if it's considering \\(c^0\\).\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are scalars.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, which would involve multiplying by the terms from the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, giving 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the problem statement again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Therefore, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems incorrect because the coefficient should be a scalar.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, is a polynomial in \\(c\\). When you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because coefficients are scalars, not polynomials.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which suggests that it's a scalar. Therefore, maybe the problem is miswritten or I'm misunderstanding it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient would just be 6, as in the first part. But that seems too simple, and the presence of the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) makes me think that the answer should involve both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression as a single polynomial, which would include all possible terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a scalar.\n\nWait, I'm going in circles here. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply two terms, the exponents add, so to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) times 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), giving 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120. Therefore, the final answer is 120.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. The term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a scalar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, which would involve multiplying by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Therefore, 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part, resulting in \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 120. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the product of the coefficients from each part of the expression. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."
