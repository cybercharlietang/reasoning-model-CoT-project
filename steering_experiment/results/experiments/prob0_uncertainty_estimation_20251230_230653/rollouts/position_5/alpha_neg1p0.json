    "text": " Using the binomial theorem, that would expand to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). \n\nWait, I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, I need \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check: if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I realize that the multiplication by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.\n\nActually, when you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply as well. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit confusing because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate expansion.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the multiplication will result in terms that have \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) multiplied by terms that have \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think the coefficient will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient can't be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a sum of terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each multiplied by 6, because the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. So, when you multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient, not considering \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem might just be asking for the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, in the expanded form, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, but that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is a variable, so the coefficient would involve \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression as a product, but without considering \\(c\\). Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a sum involving \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. Let me check: if that's the case, then I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term, and then multiply it by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n\nSo, first, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem probably expects a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^n\\), which simplifies to \\(a^kb^{4 - k} c^{m - n}\\). But when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all terms where \\(k = 2\\) (since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the corresponding terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient is a number. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for the \\(c^0\\) term. As I calculated earlier, that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem probably expects a numerical answer. So, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me expand both parts step by step.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNext, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe can list the terms:\n\n- For k=0: \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} c^6 = 1 * c^6\\)\n- For k=1: \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- For k=2: \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- For k=3: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\)\n- For k=4: \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- For k=5: \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- For k=6: \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion, resulting in:\n\n- \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\)\n- \\(6 * 6a^2b^2c^4 = 36a^2b^2c^4\\)\n- \\(6 * 15a^2b^2c^2 = 90a^2b^2c^2\\)\n- \\(6 * 20a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(6 * 15a^2b^2c^{-2} = 90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(6 * 6a^2b^2c^{-4} = 36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(6 * 1a^2b^2c^{-6} = 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120, and that term is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum of all these coefficients, but that doesn't make sense because each term has a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is:\n\n\\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90c^{-2} + 36c^{-4} + 6c^{-6}\\).\n\nBut that seems unlikely because the problem probably expects a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem and find the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0), which is 20.\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Let me compute the coefficients: \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\), and \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\). So, the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nNow, the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so looking at the expansion, that term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. \n\nI think so because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that we're looking for the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) and the other variables (c and 1/c) are multiplied in such a way that they don't affect the a and b terms. Wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. \n\nWait, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all the terms in the second expansion that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in \\(a^2b^2\\) times something else, but the something else is in terms of c. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we might be considering the entire expression as a product, but perhaps we're only interested in the part that's \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because the entire expression is a product, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But unless we're told to consider the entire expression as a polynomial in a, b, c, and 1/c, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in c. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's considering the entire expression as a product and just wants the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms. So, perhaps we need to sum over all the possible coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nWait, let me clarify. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I expand it, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a constant, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some combination of c terms. But since c and 1/c are separate variables, the coefficient would actually be a sum over all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in c, not a single number. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of a, b, c, and 1/c are such that the total exponent of c is zero, so that the term is just a number times \\(a^2b^2\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve c terms. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the constant term in c, i.e., the term where the exponent of c is zero, multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nIf that's the case, then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, first, we find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the constant term. \n\nTo find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of c to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the final answer should be 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them gives 120. So, yes, that should be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering the constant term in c. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering c, then it would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a scalar, it must be referring to the term where the exponents of c cancel out, leaving just \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a constant. Therefore, 120 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) (which is 6) by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) (which is 20). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

So, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). Let me compute that coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, right? Because 4 choose 2 is 6. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts together. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Because when you multiply two expressions together, the terms combine. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient will just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only affected by the first part, and the second part is multiplied to it, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. But wait, no, that's not correct either. Let me think again.\n\nActually, when you have two separate expressions multiplied together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term is only present in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and it gets multiplied by every term in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion would include all the terms, and the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second part is when you set \\(c = 1\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, each term in the second expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, you get terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 6 times 64, which is 384. So, that seems to be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's possible that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is combined with different powers of \\(c\\), but since the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then yes, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product, and when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each coefficient in the second expansion, and since the problem doesn't specify any particular \\(c\\) term, the total coefficient is the sum of all those scalings, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, that term would be \\( (coeff of a^2b^2 in P) * (each term in Q) \\). So, if I'm just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it would be the coefficient from P times the sum of all coefficients in Q. Because each term in Q adds a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is the sum of all those multiples.\n\nSo, in this case, the coefficient from P is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in Q is when c=1, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify this by another approach. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent polynomials, one in a and b, and one in c and 1/c. So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent, so the coefficients multiply accordingly. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of any term in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), but since we're not concerned with the power of c, we just need to sum all the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to compute the entire expansion, I would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) for k from 0 to 6, each with coefficient 6*\\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But since the problem doesn't specify any particular power of c, just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c, then the total coefficient is the sum over all k of 6*\\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), which is 6*(sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for k=0 to 6) = 6*2^6 = 6*64=384.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately. Using the binomial theorem, it's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is when c=1, which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, I think that's the answer. I don't see any mistakes in this reasoning.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, \\((a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). \n\nSimplifying the binomial coefficients, I get: 1, 4, 6, 4, 1. So, the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6 in this case. But hold on, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that as well. \n\nHmm, so the overall expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the c terms? Or do I? \n\nWait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps that term only comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part by the entire second part, but since the second part doesn't have a's or b's, maybe the coefficient just gets scaled by whatever the expansion of the second part is. \n\nWait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in the expansion will be of the form (term from first expansion) \\(\\times\\) (term from second expansion). \n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to see how \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), only involves c and 1/c, so it doesn't affect the a and b terms. \n\nWait, so if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in the first part is 6a^2b^2, and then it's multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is probably expecting a single coefficient, not an expression. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some k? But no, the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering all terms where the exponents of a and b are 2, regardless of the c terms. \n\nWait, but in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by 6a^2b^2, would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering all possible c terms, meaning the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that might not be right either. Let me think again. When you have two variables, a and b, and another variable c, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, if you consider the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, meaning the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second expansion. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's expecting just the coefficient without considering the c terms. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression includes c terms. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any power of c. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when c=1, which is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me check. If I set c=1, then the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it as the product of the two expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the second part is a polynomial in c, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term in the second expansion. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c, then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. Let me check what that is. \n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, the term where the exponent of c is 0 would be when 6 - 2k = 0, so k=3. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any power of c. So, does that mean it's considering all possible powers of c, or just the constant term? \n\nHmm, I think in such contexts, unless specified, it might mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c, which would be the sum over all c terms. So, that would be 6 * (sum of coefficients of the second expansion) = 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second expansion. \n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c, then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's considering all possible c terms, meaning the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me check again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which includes different powers of c. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, but if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion. \n\nWait, but that might not be correct because the problem is probably treating the entire expression as a single polynomial, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible c terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI'm a bit confused now. Let me try to think differently. Maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all possible powers of c. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is separate, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product. \n\nWait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial has terms with a and b, and the second has terms with c and 1/c. So, the terms involving a and b are separate from those involving c. \n\nWait, that means that when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating c as another variable, so the coefficient would include all the terms from the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would make it a polynomial, not a single coefficient. \n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific k, but it's not stated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of a, b, and c are all zero, but that doesn't seem right either. \n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again. It says: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where k ranges from 0 to 4, and m ranges depending on the expansion of the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when k=2, so from the first part, and then multiplied by each term from the second part. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second expansion. \n\nBut if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c, then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think the problem is probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c, so 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check with an example. \n\nSuppose I set c=1, then the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * (1 + 1)^6 = (a + b)^4 * 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I set c=1, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I set c=-1, then the second part becomes \\(( -1 + (-1) )^6 = ( -2 )^6 = 64, same as before. So, regardless of c, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems a bit strange because the second part isn't just a constant; it's a polynomial in c. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire polynomial, meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial itself. \n\nWait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is only interested in the constant term, i.e., the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nHmm, I'm going in circles here. Let me try to think differently. \n\nThe problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, in the expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, which is 6a^2b^2, and then it's multiplied by each term in the second part. So, each term in the second part is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum over all k of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nBut that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in c, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression as a product, regardless of c. So, perhaps it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. \n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating c as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. \n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think I need to clarify this. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, which is a polynomial in c, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in c, which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when c is set to 1, which would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify any power of c, so I think it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure. Let me try to think of it another way. \n\nSuppose I expand the entire product. The first part is \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). \n\nSo, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times each term in the second expansion. \n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c, then it's 6 times the entire second expansion, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in c. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think I need to make a decision here. Given that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not specifying any power of c, I think it's expecting the coefficient to be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut to be thorough, let me check both possibilities. \n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nIf it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, then it's 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nGiven that the problem doesn't specify any power of c, I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c, which would be 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have an expression like \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, the problem must be expecting a numerical coefficient, which suggests that it's asking for the coefficient when considering all possible c terms, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think I need to go with the first interpretation because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying c, so it's likely expecting the sum over all c terms, which would be 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me consider that in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where k is from 0 to 4 and m depends on the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when k=2, and then for each m, we have a term \\(a^2b^2c^m\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all m of (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^m\\)), which is 6 times the sum over all m of (coefficient of \\(c^m\\) in the second expansion). \n\nBut the sum over all coefficients of the second expansion is when c=1, which is 64, so the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 120 if considering only the constant term. But since the problem didn't specify, I think 384 is the correct answer. \n\nSo, to recap: \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\n2. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a sum of coefficients equal to 64 when c=1. \n\n3. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nSo, the final answer is 384. \n\nBut wait, let me double-check. If I set c=1, then the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * (1 + 1)^6 = (a + b)^4 * 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nYes, that seems correct. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of the coefficients of this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\\). Let me compute those coefficients. \n\nFirst, \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}\\) is 1, so that term is \\(a^4\\). Then, \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}\\) is 4, so the next term is \\(4a^3b\\). Next, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, so that's \\(6a^2b^2\\). Then, \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}\\) is 4 again, giving \\(4ab^3\\), and finally, \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}\\) is 1, so the last term is \\(b^4\\). \n\nSo, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Cool, so I can see that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression, which also includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nHmm, so I think that means I have to consider how the two parts multiply together. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, so that means I need to find all the terms in the product where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), those terms won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. So, actually, the \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms will only affect the coefficients, but the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when multiplied by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that means we can treat the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, no, because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the other expansion, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when we set \\(c = 1\\), which is \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64 \\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 * 64 = 384? But that seems high. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is in terms of \\(c\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the other expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expression. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. So, that can't be right.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we can treat the coefficient as 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's just 6 times the expansion, which would be 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But that seems complicated, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check.\n\nWait, let's think differently. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, since the two expressions are separate in terms of variables, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expression. \n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's expecting a numerical coefficient, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but that's not possible unless we consider that the coefficient is a polynomial. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated, and I think the problem is more likely expecting a numerical coefficient, so perhaps we need to consider that the entire expression is being expanded, and we need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, but that's not possible because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times that expansion. \n\nBut perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some specific power of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the variables are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient as a polynomial, so the answer would be \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit strange because the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number, not an expression. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we can treat \\(c\\) as a constant, and thus the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion. But that still doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering that the expression is a product of two polynomials. So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) only appears in the first polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. \n\nBut that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. So, the coefficient is \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems to be the case, but perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm missing something. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) and not the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the sum of the coefficients is when you set \\(c=1\\), but in this case, \\(c\\) is a variable, not a constant. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which seems unlikely. \n\nWait, maybe I should just compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and since the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a separate polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that seems to be the case. So, perhaps the answer is \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But let me check if that makes sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient to be a number, so perhaps I need to evaluate \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply by 6. But that would give a polynomial, not a number. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating all variables as separate, so the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut let me think differently. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Since the problem only mentions \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's expecting the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when we set \\(c=1\\), so that's \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64 \\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6*64=384. \n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct approach because the problem is about the coefficient in the product, not the sum of coefficients. \n\nWait, let's think about how the product works. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire second expression. So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems to be the case. \n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because \\((a + b)^1\\) only has terms up to \\(ab\\). But in our case, \\((a + b)^4\\) has \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient is \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, so maybe I need to expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply by 6. Let me try that. \n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, the expansion is:\n- \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, putting it all together, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6)\\). \n\nBut that seems to be the case. So, the coefficient is \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, so that term would be \\(6(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6)a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed \\(6(c + 1/c)^6\\). \n\nBut perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but I think the correct answer is that the coefficient is \\(6(c + 1/c)^6\\), because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire second expansion. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a specific power of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, I think the answer is \\(6(c + 1/c)^6\\). \n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because \\((a + b)^2\\) only goes up to \\(ab\\). Wait, no, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), so there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be zero. \n\nBut in our problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of the second part. \n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, 6*20=120. \n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but considering that \\(c\\) is a variable, then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6*20=120. \n\nBut the problem didn't specify, so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient as a polynomial, which would be \\(6(c + 1/c)^6\\). But I'm not sure. \n\nWait, maybe I should think about it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(6(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6)\\). \n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient as a numerical value, then perhaps it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific power of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, I think the answer is \\(6(c + 1/c)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is in English, and it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient as a polynomial, meaning that it's 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is simply 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nWait, let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient in the first part times the entire second part, because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut to make sure, let me consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. \n\nSo, that would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut let me check if that's the case. For example, if I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because the first polynomial doesn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But in our case, the first polynomial does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is 6 times the second polynomial. \n\nSo, I think the answer is \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, so maybe I need to expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply by 6. \n\nAs I did earlier, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). \n\nSo, multiplying by 6, we get \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps that's the answer. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, maybe it's asking for the constant term, which would be 120. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify, so I think the correct answer is \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6\\). \n\nBut perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, so maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me try a different approach. \n\nThe problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSince \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient in the first part times the entire second part. \n\nSo, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(6\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut if the problem is expecting a numerical value, perhaps it's considering that \\(c\\) is a variable and the coefficient is a polynomial, so the answer is \\(6\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific power of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, I think the answer is \\(6\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since the terms in the first polynomial are in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the terms in the second are in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the entire second polynomial. \n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(6\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut to make sure, let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because the first polynomial only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) to the first power. \n\nIn our case, the first polynomial has \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 6 times the second polynomial. \n\nTherefore, the answer is \\(6\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, let me check if that makes sense. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then the coefficient should be 6 * (1 + 1)^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nSo, when \\(c = 1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. \n\nBut if \\(c = 2\\), then the coefficient would be 6*(2 + 1/2)^6 = 6*(5/2)^6, which is a different value. \n\nSo, the coefficient depends on the value of \\(c\\), which makes sense because the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps that's the answer. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's a trick question, and the answer is 6, but that doesn't seem right because the second part affects the coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the entire expression as a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nBut the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64, so 6*64=384. \n\nBut that would be the coefficient when \\(c = 1\\), but the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), so I think the correct answer is \\(6\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which can also be written as \\(6(c + 1/c)^6\\). \n\nBut let me just confirm one more time. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, yes, the coefficient is \\(6(c + 1/c)^6\\). \n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\(6(c + 1/c)^6\\), which can be written as \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting a numerical value, but since \\(c\\) is a variable, it's a polynomial. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 6*20=120. \n\nWait, that's another possibility. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6*20=120. \n\nBut the problem didn't specify, so I'm not sure. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut I think the correct answer is \\(6(c + 1/c)^6\\). \n\nWait, but let me think about how coefficients work in products. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a term \\(x^k y^m\\) is the sum of the products of coefficients from each polynomial where the exponents add up to \\(k\\) and \\(m\\). But in this case, since the first polynomial only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second only has \\(c\\), the coefficients don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the entire second polynomial. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(6(c + 1/c)^6\\). \n\nBut to make sure, let me consider that if I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). \n\nWhen I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2/c^2 + 36a^2b^2/c^4 + 6a^2b^2/c^6\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6(c + 1/c)^6\\), which is the same as \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(6(c + 1/c)^6\\), which is the answer. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting the expression in terms of \\(c\\), which is \\(6(c + 1/c)^6\\). \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's a different approach. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and since the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a separate polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second polynomial. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(6(c + 1/c)^6\\). \n\nSo, after all this thinking, I believe the answer is \\(6(c + 1/c)^6\\), which can be written as \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut to make sure, let me think about it one more time. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial, because each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer is \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's expecting a numerical value. But since \\("

Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how the multiplication affects the coefficient. However, I notice that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part of the expression, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second part. That means when I multiply these two expressions together, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms won't interact with the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression should just be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), because the other part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). \n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing something. Let me think about how the multiplication works. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and it will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think I just need to consider the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Is it possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\)? Because if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too large, and I don't think that's what the question is asking. \n\nWait, no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any conditions on \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficients add up. \n\nBut let me check that logic again. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, if I take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and multiply it by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. Each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by all the terms from the second part, each contributing their own coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is indeed \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach it differently. Let's consider the entire expression as the product of two independent binomial expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, since each term in the second part can be combined with \\(a^2b^2\\) to form terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), etc. Since the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so that would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some specific power of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, I think it's safe to assume that it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, let me make sure. Let me try to compute it another way. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we saw. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). \n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, giving \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). \n\nBut the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), as before. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because sometimes when you have products, the coefficients can combine in non-trivial ways, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), I think this approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a small example to make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding \\((a + b)^2\\) gives \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and expanding \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) gives \\(c + 1/c\\). Now, the product would be \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in this product is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is 2 when \\(c = 1\\), but if I'm just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum of coefficients, which is 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is 1 (from \\((a + b)^2\\)) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second part). So, that seems to confirm my approach.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms with positive and negative exponents of \\(c\\). But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think it's correct to multiply by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64.\n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of coefficients in the second part. The sum of coefficients is found by plugging \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). That's correct.\n\nSo, yes, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Let me compute those coefficients. \n\nFirst, \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}\\) is 1, so that term is \\(a^4\\). Next, \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}\\) is 4, so that term is \\(4a^3b\\). Then, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, so that term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). After that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}\\) is 4, giving \\(4ab^3\\), and finally, \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}\\) is 1, so that term is \\(b^4\\). \n\nOkay, so the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Now, I need to multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so the entire expression is the product of these two expansions. But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to consider all the terms from the second expansion; I just need to find the terms that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will result in the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the final product. Wait, no, actually, I think I might be misunderstanding. Let me clarify: when we multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part and then multiply it by each term in the second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is already a term without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the multiplication by the second expression will affect the exponent of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think we just need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables. But that doesn't seem right because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem just asks for the coefficient, so perhaps it's considering the coefficient without any \\(c\\) terms, meaning the constant term when considering the second expansion. Wait, that might make sense.\n\nLet me rephrase: We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because the coefficient would then be a polynomial, not a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all terms, but only for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That is, maybe we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number, not a polynomial. Let me check that interpretation. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) sum to zero, i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That seems plausible.\n\nSo, to approach this, I need to first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. Then, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), because that's the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Once I have that, I can multiply the two coefficients together to get the final coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\).\n\nSo, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second expansion, giving \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would also be 120. But since it just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's safe to assume that they're looking for the coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial. Therefore, the more reasonable interpretation is that they're asking for the coefficient when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term. So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\nLet me recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem and found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, I considered the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and found the constant term by setting the exponent of \\(c\\) to zero, which gave me 20. Multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't consider the constant term and instead thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, the correct approach is to find the constant term in the second expansion and multiply it by 6, resulting in 120.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so if I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2 because the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) should be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is part of the first part, and then it's multiplied by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, maybe I do, but perhaps the \\(c\\) terms will just contribute a constant factor when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might need to consider how that term interacts with the second expression. But actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, when I multiply it by the second part, which is in terms of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part, right? Wait, no, that doesn't seem quite right because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only present in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply the entire expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we need to consider that the coefficient is actually the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expression, but that doesn't make sense because the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\), not \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, they are asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire expansion, there will be terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients of the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. \n\nWait, but that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is not a constant. So that can't be right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a constant. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the expansion, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present only once, multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), perhaps we can treat the second part as a constant when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only concerned with the part that affects \\(a^2b^2\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are separate. So, maybe the coefficient is just 6, as calculated from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). But that seems incorrect because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a constant. \n\nBut that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a constant. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a constant. \n\nSo, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is the same as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expansion. So, to do that, I need to consider how the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part interacts with the terms in the second part. \n\nSo, let's break it down. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, has the term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). \n\nNow, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so we need to consider all the terms where the power of \\(c\\) is zero because that's when the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a constant. So, we need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 - 2k = 0 \\Rightarrow 2k = 6 \\Rightarrow k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the term where \\(k = 3\\) in the second part will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Let's find that coefficient. For \\(k = 3\\), the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the term in the second part when \\(k = 3\\) is \\(20c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, when we multiply this by the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term from the first part, we get \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the first part gives \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the second part, when \\(k = 3\\), gives \\(20c^0 = 20\\). So, multiplying them together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\), so the coefficient is indeed 120. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part, since the \\(c\\) terms are separate. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the coefficient from the second part that contributes to the \\(c^0\\) term is 20, so the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120. \n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Let me verify the binomial coefficients again. \n\nFor the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), which is correct. \n\nFor the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the 0 power occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct. \n\nMultiplying them together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\), so yes, the coefficient is 120. \n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Hmm, but wait a second, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), right? So, when I multiply these two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will come from the product of the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and some term in the second part that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, actually, no. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this product, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), that means we need to find all the terms in the product where the power of \\(c\\) is zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term without any \\(c\\)s. \n\nWait, but no, actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will be multiplied by each term in that expansion. However, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is a product, we have to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

When we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, that would just be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term, but the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient in the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and its expansion will have terms with different powers of \\(c\\). However, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those terms will create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), but none of these will be just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be zero because all the terms would have some power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps I'm misunderstanding something. Let me check the problem again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so maybe the question is considering the entire product and looking for terms where the variables are only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), ignoring \\(c\\) or considering \\(c\\) terms separately. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is part of the expression. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2 \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of the coefficients of all such terms. But that seems a bit odd because usually, when you talk about the coefficient of a term in a product, you consider the variables involved. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, meaning the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is just 1. So, in that case, we would need to find the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that have \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term, and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. \n\nYes, that makes more sense.

When I multiply these two parts together, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, resulting in \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nI think that makes sense.

Let me compute those coefficients. \n\nThe coefficients are the binomial coefficients for 4 choose k, where k goes from 0 to 4. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\), and \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\). So, the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nOkay, so the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is the third term, which has a coefficient of 6. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so that means I have to multiply these two expressions together. But I only care about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but when you multiply two expressions, the variables in each part multiply as well. So, for example, if I take a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables will combine. However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second part, when I multiply them, I'll have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m (1/c)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m - (6 - m)}\\), which is \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{2m - 6}\\). \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) come only from the first part, right? Because the second part only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions, the variables from the first part will be \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) and the variables from the second part will be \\(c^{m - (6 - m)}\\), as I wrote earlier. \n\nBut since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means I need to find all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively. So, in the first part, \\(a + b\\) raised to 4, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6a^2b^2, as I found earlier. \n\nNow, when I multiply this term by each term from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the second part will have some power of \\(c\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part's expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part doesn't contribute any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will be \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nWait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the product, each term will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only interested in the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). \n\nSo, that means that in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, you get \\(6 \\times\\) (coefficient from second part) times \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{...}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nBut is that correct? Let me think again. Because when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first polynomial. Therefore, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me check what the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is. \n\nThe sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me make sure I'm not missing something. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each term in the product is a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply them, the variables multiply. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second, the variables don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. \n\nBut wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe I should think of the entire product as a product of two independent polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But that can't be right because the second part is multiplied by the first part, so the coefficient would be scaled by the sum of the coefficients of the second part. \n\nWait, let me think again. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms where each term from P is multiplied by each term from Q. So, the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), when multiplied by Q(c), will have the same coefficient as in P, but multiplied by each term in Q. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c, that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient from P multiplied by the entire sum of Q's coefficients. \n\nWait, but that's only if we're considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by all possible terms from Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check this another way. Let me expand both parts separately and see. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), as I had before. \n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, the coefficients for each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) are \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\). \n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). \n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when we set \\(c = 1\\), so that gives us \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\), as I had before. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 * 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure that this is correct. Because when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, I get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, all these terms would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, for example, \\(6a^2b^2 * c^6\\) has coefficient 6, \\(6a^2b^2 * c^4\\) has coefficient 6 * 6 = 36, and so on. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, each term in the second expansion has its own coefficient. So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^6\\), the coefficient is 6 * 1 = 6. When I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(6c^4\\), the coefficient is 6 * 6 = 36. Similarly, multiplying by \\(15c^2\\) gives 6 * 15 = 90, and so on. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 36, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 90, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (with \\(c^0\\)) is 6 * 20 = 120, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\) is 6 * 15 = 90, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-4}\\) is 6 * 6 = 36, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\) is 6 * 1 = 6. \n\nWait a second, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, that would include all terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any integer \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all these coefficients: 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6. \n\nLet me add these up: \n\n6 + 36 = 42 \n\n42 + 90 = 132 \n\n132 + 120 = 252 \n\n252 + 90 = 342 \n\n342 + 36 = 378 \n\n378 + 6 = 384 \n\nSo, the total coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, that's the same as 6 times 64, which makes sense because 64 is the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, and 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nSo, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384. \n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in my reasoning. Another way to think about it is that when you have two independent polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial multiplied by the entire other polynomial is just the coefficient of that term in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nIn this case, the first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but wait, the second part only involves \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), so it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. That means, when I multiply the two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the product of the coefficients from each part, right? Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply, and the variables multiply as well. But since the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a constant factor when considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nSo, I need to find the coefficient of the entire expression, which is 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second part, because when you multiply the two expressions, each term from the first part gets multiplied by each term from the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient will just be 6 times whatever the second part evaluates to, but since we're not considering any specific power of \\(c\\), maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, actually, no. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the first part, and the second part is just a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're just looking for the coefficient, not any specific term involving \\(c\\), perhaps it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, that doesn't sound right either.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6*64=384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me clarify: The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. But the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), setting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure if this is the correct approach because the problem might just be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, but I think that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, so each term in the product is a combination of terms from both parts. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second part, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But when you multiply 6 by that expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384, as before. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have products, the coefficients don't just multiply like that. Let me make sure. For example, if I have \\((a + b)(c + d)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(c\\) is 1, but in the product, the coefficient of \\(ac\\) is 1*1=1, and the coefficient of \\(ad\\) is 1*1=1, etc. So, in that case, the coefficients do multiply. So, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part, when expanded, is a sum of terms with coefficients. So, when you multiply 6 by each of those coefficients, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second part would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Therefore, 6*64=384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times (1/c)^n\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m + n = 6\\) for the second part. But when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're only interested in the terms where \\(k=2\\) from the first part. So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}=6\\), and then we have to multiply this by the entire expansion of the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c=1\\), which gives \\(2^6=64\\), so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure. Let me think about a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2}=1\\), and the second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1*(1 + 1) = 2, because when you multiply \\(a^2\\) by each term in the second part, you get \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\), each with coefficient 1, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2\\) would be 1*1 + 1*1 = 2. Wait, but in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is 1*(sum of coefficients in the second part). So, that seems to confirm that the approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, applying that to our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6*64=384. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering that the entire expression is a polynomial in \\(a, b, c, 1/c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the product of the two expressions, and when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the product of the coefficients from each part, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just 6 times the entire second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the variables, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me also compute the sum of coefficients in the second part another way. The expression is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is when \\(c=1\\), so it's \\((1 + 1)^6=2^6=64\\). So, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 6*64=384.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\).

The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Simplifying the binomial coefficients, that would be \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, from this, I can see that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by another expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the entire product. Since the two parts are multiplied together, the overall expression is the product of the expansions of each part. \n\nSo, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and the terms involving \\(c\\) are in the other. Therefore, when I multiply them together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product should just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) because the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, is that correct?

But the problem doesn't specify any particular term involving \\(c\\); it just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, in the entire product, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, considering all possible terms from the second expression. But actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), when you multiply it by the entire second expression, each term in the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, is that the case? Let me think. If I have two expressions, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) would have terms where each term of \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term of \\(Q(c)\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would correspond to all terms in \\(P(a, b)\\) that are \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(Q(c)\\), I get the sum of its coefficients. Let me check that. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is 64. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from \\(P(a, b)\\)) multiplied by 64 (the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\)), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think again. When I have \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then every term in \\(Q(c)\\) will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then I would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(Q(c)\\) and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any \\(c\\) terms, I think it's implying that we consider all possible \\(c\\) terms multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me double-check by expanding both parts. Let's first expand \\((a + b)^4\\) as I did before: \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Now, the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in this expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} 1^{6 - 2k} = 2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. \n\nTherefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. \n\nSo, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not misinterpreting the problem. The problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps it's more precise to say that each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), then I would have to find the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion and multiply it by 6. But since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes in problems, when they ask for the coefficient of a term, they might be considering only the terms where the other variables are present, but in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the variables \\(a, b, c\\) all present in the term, so perhaps the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem didn't specify the \\(c\\) part. Hmm, but the problem is written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's just 6, because the other part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply by the second expression, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms involving \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all these coefficients. \n\nWait, but that's not quite right. Because in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times\\) (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). \n\nSo, since the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, as we calculated earlier, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in one variable is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the variables are separate, so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is about \\(c\\). But no, because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, leading to multiple terms in the product, each with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term in \\(c\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is ambiguous. It could mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, or it could mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific term in \\(c\\). But since the problem didn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, I think the first interpretation is correct, that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term in \\(c\\), so the sum of all coefficients would be 64, leading to 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut to make sure, let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is (1 + 1) = 2, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 2. \n\nWait, but if I look at the product, it's \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 times \\(c\\) and 1 times \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). But if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's not a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps in that case, the problem would specify something like the coefficient of \\(a\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 1 times 1 = 1. \n\nWait, but in our original problem, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because when you multiply by the second polynomial, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in the first polynomial, because the second polynomial's terms involve \\(c\\), which are separate variables. \n\nWait, that seems conflicting with my earlier thought. Let me try to clarify. If I have two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\), then when I multiply them, the variables are separate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as in the first polynomial, because the second polynomial doesn't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier reasoning. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) which is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and I multiply it by \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), then each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, leading to \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 6a^2b^2c^4 + 6a^2b^2c^2 + 6a^2b^2 + 6a^2b^2c^{-2} + 6a^2b^2c^{-4} + 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). \n\nSo, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) appears multiplied by each power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\), which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, as calculated before, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems different from my initial thought. So, perhaps the correct answer is 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. Let's calculate that. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in all the multiplied terms, each time with a different power of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 120. \n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It just says \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), but the problem didn't specify that. \n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, which is a Laurent polynomial in \\(c\\), the product will have terms \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\), which is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all variables, then it's zero unless \\(c\\) is raised to a specific power. But since the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), perhaps it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you have separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, because the second polynomial doesn't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, perhaps the answer is 6. \n\nBut that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nWait, let me take a concrete example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the product is \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is 2 when evaluated at \\(c = 1\\). \n\nBut in this case, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it would be the sum of the coefficients of \\(a\\) times each power of \\(c\\), which is 1 * (1 + 1) = 2. So, in this simple case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is 2, which is the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first polynomial (which is 1) times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial (which is 2). \n\nSimilarly, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384. \n\nWait, but to make sure, let me calculate the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial again. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I think the answer is 384. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) appears when \\(k = 2\\), and its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Considering the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nLet me write that out: \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if I want the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check: if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). Yep, that makes sense. So the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think the coefficient I just found is only for the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. But since the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, let me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's being multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient remains 6. \n\nWait, but hold on. When you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term is only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it would still be \\(a^2b^2\\) times something with \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) part? \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would mean considering all possible ways \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear when multiplying both expansions. But wait, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term with coefficient 6, and when multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those will contribute to the overall coefficient. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in the second expansion, the overall coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, no, that's not right. \n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and any term from the second polynomial, say \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), the resulting term will be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) in the second part. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term with \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. Let's write it out: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the exponent on \\(c\\) to be 0, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial. So, yes, that makes sense because any other term in the second polynomial would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would change the term to something like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-1}\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term in the second polynomial contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. I think that makes sense. Let me double-check my calculations. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a constant term when the exponent on \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI don't see any mistakes in that reasoning. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the contributions from both parts of the expression. Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives the final coefficient.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). Okay, so the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient here is 6. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider both expansions and how they multiply together.\n\nLet me think about this. The entire expression is the product of two separate binomial expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so does that mean I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)? Wait, actually, no. Because when I multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, does that mean I have to consider all the terms in the second expansion multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\)? But that would make the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not involving \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, no, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these together, each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that is, in the expanded form of the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^l c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^l c^{-m}\\), etc. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I plug in \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I expand it, each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, but considering that the expression is a product of two separate expansions, so perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the first part, and the second part just scales it. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is multiplied by the first part, so each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting a numerical coefficient, which would mean that maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for each of those terms would be 6 times the corresponding coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a sum of all those coefficients. Wait, but that would require knowing all the coefficients from the second expansion, which is a bit more involved.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, and that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial. But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number, not a polynomial. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, but treating \\(c\\) as a variable separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 times each term in that expansion. So, for example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6 * 1, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would be 6 * 6, and so on. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient, which is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit odd because the problem is phrased as asking for the coefficient, not the coefficient multiplied by something.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^l \\times c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^l \\times c^{-m}\\), etc. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would give us terms like \\(6c^6\\), \\(36c^4\\), \\(80c^2\\), \\(80/c^2\\), \\(36/c^4\\), and \\(6/c^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\right)\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is this entire polynomial. However, the problem is phrased as asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, but perhaps the problem is only interested in the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That is, the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, so \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). In that case, I would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when the number of \\(c\\) terms and \\(1/c\\) terms are equal. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is the term where the exponents cancel. Let me calculate that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). To find the constant term, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), is 120. But wait, the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is phrased as asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, but that seems too simple. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial, but perhaps the problem is expecting just the numerical factor, which is 6, but that doesn't seem right either.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expression, and the second expression is entirely in terms of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\right)\\). So, the coefficient is this polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating all variables as separate, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems like an unusual way to phrase the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, but that seems too simple.\n\nWait, let me check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) is also \\(c + 1/c\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is indeed the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\), which is \\(c + 1/c\\). Similarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps that's the answer. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is phrased as asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting the expression, not just a number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\right)\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6\\). But that seems like a very involved answer, and the problem is phrased as asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the answer is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6\\). But the problem is phrased as asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting just the numerical factor when considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient depends on \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 times the constant term of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so maybe that's not what it's asking.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6\\). So, that would be the coefficient. But the problem is phrased as asking for the coefficient, so perhaps that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, but that seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient is that polynomial. But the problem is phrased as asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. But that would mean that the coefficient is 384, which is a number. So, perhaps that's the answer the problem is expecting.\n\nWait, let me check: the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, if I multiply that by 6, I get 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. But does that make sense?\n\nWait, but in reality, when you expand the entire product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then perhaps it's expecting the sum of all those coefficients, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is phrased as asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number, so perhaps the intended answer is 384.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, the problem is likely expecting the expression of the coefficient, which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), expanded as \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6\\).\n\nBut the problem is phrased as asking for the coefficient, so perhaps the intended answer is just the numerical coefficient when considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient as a polynomial, which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for similar problems or think about how such questions are typically phrased. Usually, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a specific term in a product of two binomial expansions, it's referring to the coefficient of that term regardless of other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is a polynomial, and the answer is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which can be expanded as I did before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, but that seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the expansion of the second part, so the answer is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial.\n\nWait, but the problem is phrased as asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number. So, perhaps the intended answer is 6, but that seems incorrect because the entire expression is multiplied by the second part, so the coefficient is scaled by that.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. Therefore, the answer is that polynomial.\n\nBut the problem is phrased as asking for the coefficient, so perhaps the intended answer is 6, but that seems incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the product, and the other term is in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. So, perhaps that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all terms, regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that would be the case if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion when all variables are set to 1, but that's not the case here. The problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms multiplied by \\(c\\) to some power.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so perhaps that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient is a polynomial, and the answer is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is phrased as asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number, so perhaps the intended answer is 6, but that seems too simple.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: when you have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), and you're expanding the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the answer is that polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, but that seems incorrect because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient should include the second part.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient is a polynomial, and the answer is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that would be the coefficient.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because the problem is phrased as asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number, but in this case, it's a polynomial. So, perhaps the intended answer is 6, but that seems too simple.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. Therefore, the answer is that polynomial.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, but that seems incorrect because the entire product's coefficient should include the second part.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to think differently. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient is \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is that polynomial.\n\nBut the problem is phrased as asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number, so perhaps the intended answer is 120, which is the coefficient when \\(c^0\\) is considered, but that's not specified.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the answer is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the polynomial I wrote earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, but that seems too simple.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial. Therefore, the answer is that polynomial.\n\nBut since the problem is phrased as asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number, perhaps the intended answer is 6, but that seems incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check online for similar problems. For example, if I have \\((a + b)^n \\times (c + d)^m\\), the coefficient of \\(a^kb^l\\) is the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Let me think again: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is that polynomial. Therefore, the answer is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut since the problem is asking for the coefficient, perhaps it's expecting the expanded form, which is \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient when considering the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so let me write that out. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). That simplifies to \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. But wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider both parts together. \n\nI think the way to approach this is to first find the expansion of each part separately and then multiply them together. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to fully expand the entire expression. Instead, perhaps I can focus on the parts that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the other expression. \n\nWait, but actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables in each term will be either from the first part or the second part. \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that suggests that we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate term from the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, I think it's asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), perhaps it's only the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will have different powers of \\(c\\). But if we're looking for the term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times some constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), then the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from the other expansion. \n\nSo, let me break this down. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already did as 6. Then, find the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. \n\nAlright, so let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this expansion will be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when we multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the constant term contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. \n\nSo, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so if I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4. I'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, right? Because the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is also squared. \n\nLet me write that out. If \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) is the term, and I want \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a^2\\), that would mean \\(k = 2\\). So, the term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Calculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Wait a minute, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That also can be expanded using the binomial theorem. Let me think about that.\n\nExpanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would give terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6.\n\nBut here's the thing: since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part of the expression, the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be the product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the multiplication will result in terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, actually, no, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire expression. So, does that mean we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), or are we looking for a specific term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) and maybe some specific power of \\(c\\)?\n\nWait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think that means the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which are all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the same as the coefficient in the first part, because when you multiply by the second part, which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), you're just scaling each term by the entire second polynomial. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that can't be right because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the same as the coefficient in the first part times the entire second polynomial. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me re-express the problem. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that means we're treating \\(c\\) as an independent variable, and we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum over all the products of the coefficients from the first part and the coefficients from the second part, but only for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present.\n\nWait, but actually, in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a constant. Hmm, that seems confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and the coefficient would be the sum of the products of the coefficients from the first and second parts for each term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present.\n\nWait, but that might not make sense because the coefficient would then be a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\), which would not be a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems more complicated than intended.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering only the terms where \\(c\\) is raised to a certain power, perhaps zero, but that's not specified. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is the same as the coefficient in the first part, multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a constant.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to approach it differently. Let me expand both parts separately and then see how the terms combine.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). As I did before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\right)\\).\n\nWhen you multiply these two sums together, each term is the product of a term from the first sum and a term from the second sum. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\) in the first sum, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Now, when we multiply this by each term in the second sum, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), we get terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the entire second polynomial, scaled by 6. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, which would make the coefficient a constant.\n\nIf that's the case, then we need to find the term in the second expansion where \\(c^{6 - 2m} = c^0\\), which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient from the second part when \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product would be the product of the coefficients from the first and second parts, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is intended to consider only the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient in the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, maybe the problem is expecting us to consider the coefficient when \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it should specify a particular power of \\(c\\), but assuming it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the answer would be 120.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two terms together, you get 6 * 20 = 120, and the term is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a constant. So, perhaps the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient when \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, making the term \\(a^2b^2\\) stand alone without any \\(c\\) terms.\n\nSo, to wrap it up, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering only the terms where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me think about the entire expression. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\), and it's multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because each term from the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial, not a constant.\n\nBut that can't be right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting us to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Therefore, we need to find the coefficient when \\(m = 3\\) in the second expansion, which gives \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I'm not missing anything. So, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and I'm interpreting it as the coefficient when \\(c\\) is at the zero power. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number.\n\nTherefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3.

I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) or \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in this part is 20.\n\n3. **Combining the results**:\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part.

The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Simplifying those coefficients, that's \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 6.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the other part of the expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nHmm, so maybe I should expand both parts separately and then multiply them together, but that seems complicated because both expansions would have multiple terms. But actually, I don't need to expand the entire thing. Since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of 1 (i.e., the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when I multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will multiply with the constant term from the second part to give me the overall \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. \n\nSo, let me check that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k}\\) which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nI need the term where the exponent of c is zero because that's the constant term. So, I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for k, that gives \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when I multiply these two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(6a^2b^2\\). In the other part, the constant term is 20, so when I multiply them, 6 times 20 is 120. That seems right. \n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial, provided the variables multiply to give the desired term. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve c or 1/c, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\), which gives:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Simplifying the coefficients, that would be \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). \n\nWait, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. But the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I guess I need to consider how that multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nHmm, but actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That means I need to consider all the terms that result from multiplying the two expressions together, but only the ones where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. \n\nWait, but the second part of the expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\).

However, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when we multiply it by the other expression, all the resulting terms will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, is that right? Let me think again. If I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), then when I expand this, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when I multiply this by each term in the second expansion, I get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 6, depending on the term. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). However, in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't a single term; it's part of multiple terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating this. \n\nLet me clarify: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That is, in the entire expansion, the coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expression. \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the second expression isn't a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\\). \n\nSo, the result would be \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2c^{-2} + 36a^2b^2c^{-4} + 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the entire expansion, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the term without any \\(c\\)s, which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, but considering all possible terms, including those with different powers of \\(c\\). But no, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which typically refers to the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of other variables. So, if the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum of the coefficients from each multiplication. \n\nWait, no. Actually, in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present when the \\(c\\) terms are multiplied by 1, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. \n\nSo, let me break it down:\n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which is when the exponent is zero. \n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. Let's let \\(k\\) be the exponent of \\(c\\), so each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, that seems consistent with my earlier thought. So, the final answer should be 120. \n\nLet me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations. \n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nNext, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nMultiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nYes, that seems correct.

Let me think differently. When you have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), their expansions are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in the second expression, which is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, without considering \\(c\\). But since \\(c\\) is part of the expression, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, let me check another approach. If I consider the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then when I expand it, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives me \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the \\(c\\) part, I need to consider all possible \\(m\\) such that \\(6 - 2m\\) is whatever exponent, but since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would involve summing over all possible exponents of \\(c\\). But that's not standard. Typically, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of expressions, you consider the entire term, including all variables. So, if you're asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would imply that you're looking for the coefficient when \\(c\\) is also at a certain power, but since it's not specified, maybe it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\).\n\nSo, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nTherefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. If I expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that's not a number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and not considering the second part. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is the product of both parts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that's not a numerical value, so perhaps the problem is miswritten or I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would make sense. So, in that case, the coefficient is 6 times the constant term in the second expression, which is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, and the second part is a separate term, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I multiply them together, the product will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. But when you multiply these, each term is \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m - n}\\), depending on the exponents. Wait, no, actually, each term in the first expansion is \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) and each term in the second is \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\), which is \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply them, you get \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we set \\(k = 2\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) implies \\(a^2b^{4 - 2}\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when we multiply the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{n}\\) would be 6 times \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) where \\(6 - 2m = n\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), I think it's implying that we need to consider all possible exponents of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all \\(m\\). But that would result in 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too large.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and not considering the second part. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is miswritten or I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. That seems plausible because it's a standard type of problem where you're asked to find the coefficient of a specific term, considering all variables.\n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. If I expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that's not a numerical value, so perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that's not a number, so that can't be.\n\nTherefore, I think the intended answer is 120, considering the constant term in the second expansion.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we first determine the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we consider the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), giving \\(k = 3\\). The constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these results gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) as \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the coefficients, I get:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, the expansion becomes:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nOkay, so I'm looking for the term with \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient here is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nLet me think. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will be multiplied by each term in that expansion. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will actually be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut hold on, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That means we need to consider all the terms in the expansion where the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared. However, the other part of the expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will contribute terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem doesn't specify any constraints on \\(c\\), we might just be looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but that might not be the case. Let me clarify. When we multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That would mean that we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but since the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), perhaps we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which would be \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). \n\nWait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me think again. When we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's equivalent to multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because it's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which might imply that we're treating \\(c\\) as an independent variable and we just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term involving \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times\\) the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, in the entire product, we're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but that's not correct either because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^6\\), we get \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), and by \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that's not a single term; it's multiple terms. So, perhaps the question is misworded, or I'm misunderstanding it. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). That is, the term where the power of \\(c\\) cancels out, so we have \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that we're treating \\(c\\) as another variable, and the coefficient would be the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), multiplied by 6. But that seems unlikely because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. \n\nLet me consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a constant, which would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when all variables are considered, which would mean that we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps we're just to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6, and the rest is separate. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when we multiply it by the second part, it becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, and we're to consider all terms, but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. \n\nSo, if that's the case, then I need to find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nLet me recall that the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the constant term is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nFrom earlier, we found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nSo, multiplying these together, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check this. If I consider the entire product, \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean that we're considering all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). However, if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term, without considering \\(c\\), that might not make sense because \\(c\\) is part of the expression. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when all variables are combined, but that's unclear. \n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify, so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the answer would then be a polynomial, not a number. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. That would make sense, and the answer would be 120. \n\nSo, to confirm, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient when considering all terms, which would mean summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, no, that's not right. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that's not correct either because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. \n\nI think I'm getting confused here. Let me try to clarify. \n\nThe expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. \n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's not a single coefficient but multiple coefficients for different powers of \\(c\\). However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving 120. \n\nGiven that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's possible that it's considering all powers of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"
