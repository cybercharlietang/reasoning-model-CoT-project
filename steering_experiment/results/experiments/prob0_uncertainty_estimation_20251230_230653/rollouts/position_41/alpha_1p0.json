Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap: 1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. 2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. 3. Multiply them together to get 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems solid. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. The binomial coefficients are correct, and the reasoning about the exponents seems right. So, I'm confident the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting the exponent equal to 0, giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, the coefficient should be 120. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. Let me write out the entire expansion or at least the relevant parts.
