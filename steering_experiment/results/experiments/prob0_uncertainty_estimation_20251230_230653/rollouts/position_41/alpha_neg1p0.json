    "text": " In the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term (c^0) is when m=3, which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in understanding the problem. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

So, the coefficient is indeed 120. I think that's correct. Let me just recap to ensure I didn't miss anything. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of two expansions. The first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) having a coefficient of 6. The second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a constant term (c^0) with a coefficient of 20. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we multiply these two coefficients together to get 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

    "text": " The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the other expansion, which gives 20. Since these are being multiplied together in the product, the coefficients also multiply. So, 6 * 20 is indeed 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, first, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That seems correct. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when we multiply these two parts, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term from the second part, their coefficients multiply, giving 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the entire expression as the product of two expansions. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply them together, each term in the first expansion multiplies each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that's \\(a^2b^2\\) and the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that's \\(c^0\\). So, yes, their coefficients multiply to give the final coefficient. Therefore, I think 120 is correct.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me write out the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) a bit more. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, for m=0, it's \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} c^6\\), m=1: \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} c^4\\), m=2: \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} c^2\\), m=3: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0\\), m=4: \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} c^{-2}\\), m=5: \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} c^{-4}\\), m=6: \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} c^{-6}\\). So, the constant term is when m=3, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), as I found earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). So, when we multiply this by the constant term from the other expansion, which is 20, we get 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nThe term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).
