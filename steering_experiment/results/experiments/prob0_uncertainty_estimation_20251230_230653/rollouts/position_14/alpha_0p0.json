    "text": " Hmm, but wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, does that mean the term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by something from the second part of the expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? But the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the second part can be any term, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), perhaps we don't need to consider the expansion of the second part? Wait, that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is the product of the two expansions. So, when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all possible terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything, but since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion? Wait, that can't be right because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has multiple terms, each with different exponents of \\(c\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe we need to consider the constant term in the second expansion, because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will contribute to the coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, but that seems incorrect because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), and unless they're constants, they won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, you'll get terms involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). That suggests that perhaps we need to find the term where, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the result is a term without \\(c\\), i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in other words, we need the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the constant term in the second part. So, let me verify that. The first part: coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. The second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) => \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so yes, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, we get \\(20a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 20 * 6 = 120. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the total coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the term from the second part that is \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, the combined coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me check again. The first part: \\((a + b)^4\\), coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. The second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if I were to multiply out the entire expression, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term from the second part, since any other term would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the term not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, I think 120 is correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the first part gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part must contribute a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is the constant term, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Expanding using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, i.e., \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).

Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Let me think. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only concerned with the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), any terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term is multiplied by each term. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it's in the product of two expressions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (if any) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) can vary, but the term that would be a constant is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, that means when I multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by this constant term, I get 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me check that again. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives me \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives me a constant term when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is at \\(k = 3\\), so that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when I multiply these two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part gets multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the entire product being the sum of all possible products of terms from each expansion, but since I'm only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, any terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) part unless they are constants. So, only the constant term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. I think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2.

    "text": " Hmm, I wonder if I need to consider this part as well. Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I can ignore the other terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)? Or do I need to consider the entire expansion? Let me think. The expression is a product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some combination of terms from the second part, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by every term in the second polynomial.

But that would make the coefficient a sum, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, wait, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in multiple variables, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. Wait, that might make sense. Let me think again. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I expand it, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a single number. Let me check: the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). To get the constant term, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from the constant term). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), so maybe I was wrong earlier. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is actually a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it's just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then depend on \\(c\\). So, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me confirm that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense.

Wait, is that correct? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, yes, I think that's right. So, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I do that?

When you multiply them together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

So, in other words, we need the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the term that won't change the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

So, the constant term is 20. Now, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's only present once in the expansion, right? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term 20, you just get \\(20a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 20 multiplied by 6, which is 120. Hmm, but let me think again. Wait, no. Actually, when you expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and when you multiply by the constant term 20 from the other expansion, the total coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the entire expansion as the product of two separate expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these are independent, when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how this term interacts with the second part. Wait, actually, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of the first will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we need to find the term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, right? Because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that constant term, it will still be \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other terms involving \\(c\\) will result in terms with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

    "text": " I'm not sure if I need to consider this part for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all? Or does it? Hmm, let me think. The entire expression is a product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way a term would have \\(a^2b^2\\) is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part. But since the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all terms in the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, and then all the like terms are combined. But in this case, \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all different variables, so there are no like terms between them. That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But wait, that can't be right because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply, each term in the first part gets multiplied by each term in the second part, but since they don't share variables, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is when you take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by each term from the second part. But then, each of those would be separate terms, so the coefficient would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct either. Let me clarify: the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second. So, for example, \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), and so on, all the way down to \\(c^0\\) or \\(c^{-6}\\). But since we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), each of these multiplications will result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c} = a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. However, the problem is asking only for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that we are to consider the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, but the exponent of \\(c\\) can be anything. But that seems odd because the question is a bit ambiguous. Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, all terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of what \\(c\\) is. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are constants. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial, not a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the terms where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, i.e., the constant term, because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms. Let me think. If that's the case, then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps that's what the problem is asking. Let me proceed under that assumption. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found to be 6. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and multiply the two together to get the final coefficient. So, let's work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check. If I consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when expanded, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will have coefficients multiplied by each of these, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6*6=36, and so on. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are supposed to be constants. Therefore, I must have misinterpreted the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. That would make sense because then the coefficient is a number. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}), which is a polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the question is about a coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me confirm that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6*(c + 1/c)^6, which is a polynomial. But that seems odd because coefficients are usually constants. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term of the second expression, resulting in 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it should be \\((a + b)^4(c + 1/c)^6\\), and they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6*(c + 1/c)^6. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to consider the entire expression and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6*20=120. I think that's the most plausible interpretation. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which is when \\(k = 3\\).

But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times something. But actually, no, because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term from the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the coefficient. Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, maybe the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear without any \\(c\\) terms is if the second expansion has a term that's a constant, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), then the term would have \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), but if I want just \\(a^2b^2\\), then I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because only the term with \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion would result in \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part. So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20.

So, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the one with \\(c^0\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but hold on, I think I made a mistake here. Let me double-check. Because the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a term \\(20c^0\\). So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(20c^0\\), giving \\(6 * 20 a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). But wait, is that the only term contributing to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because in the product, every term from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire second part, but since we're only interested in the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, we only take the 20 from the second part. So, yes, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer. Wait, but let me confirm. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the entire product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms in the second expression, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would include all possible coefficients from the second expression. But no, that can't be, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, and when multiplied by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different terms. So, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) appears without any \\(c\\) terms is when it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expression, which is \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " I wonder if I need to consider this part as well. Wait, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I can ignore the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I need to consider the entire expression and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, I think it's the latter. Because the entire expression is multiplied together, so when you multiply it out, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to consider the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because \\(c^0 = 1\\), and that's the only way the \\(a^2b^2\\) term can stand alone without any \\(c\\) factors. So, first, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when we multiply 6 by that coefficient, it will give us the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Now, since the two parts are multiplied together, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients we found. That is, 6 multiplied by 20, which equals 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the 6 and 20. So, 6 * 20 is indeed 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that makes sense. Let me just go through it again to make sure I didn't miss anything. First part: \\((a + b)^4\\), looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which gives 6. Second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), looking for \\(c^0\\), which gives 20. Multiply them together: 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6.

The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, when we multiply the terms, any term from the first expansion will have a corresponding term from the second expansion. However, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me clarify. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply it by \\((a + b)^4\\), the variables involved are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first expansion times the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, maybe we can just take the coefficient from the first part and then consider that the second part's expansion doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by all the terms in the second part, which are in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^l \\times c^m\\), where \\(k + l = 4\\) and \\(m\\) is some exponent from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we need to consider all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and sum their coefficients across all possible \\(c\\) exponents? Wait, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, treating the second part as a separate expansion. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is the product of both. So, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term from the second expansion. But since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiplied by the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's 6 times the entire second expansion. But that seems odd because the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", implying a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering that the second part is multiplied, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion.

But that still doesn't give a numerical value. Wait, maybe the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and since the second part is multiplied, it's just 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems like the coefficient would be a polynomial.

But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a numerical value, not a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, meaning that we need to consider the product of the two expansions and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), but that would require knowing the specific term. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, meaning that we can ignore the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, in that case, the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this, and the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and since the second part is multiplied, the coefficient remains 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it's equivalent to multiplying each term in the first expansion by that entire expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), making the coefficient 6 times that expression. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would then be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part.

But that still doesn't give a numerical value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would require multiplying the coefficients from each part. Wait, but the first part's coefficient is 6, and the second part's expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has its own coefficients. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that seems like the answer would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire product, considering that the entire expression is a product of two binomials. But in that case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), the entire second part becomes 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * (1 + 1)^6 = (a + b)^4 * 64\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But is that the correct approach? Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes all terms. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), I'm effectively evaluating the entire expression at \\(c = 1\\), which gives me the sum of all coefficients, but I only need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's still a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, as I calculated before. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But is that the correct way to think about it? Let me see. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, let me confirm that. The sum of the coefficients in the second part is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, each term in the first part is multiplied by 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) becomes 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems to make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the product of the two expansions, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each expansion where the variables multiply to give \\(a^2b^2\\). But in this case, since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the variables, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Since the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and it's multiplied by \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient, it's 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, meaning that we can ignore the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's still a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, meaning that we can treat the second part as a separate term, so the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. As I calculated before, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Let me check this approach again. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the coefficient of a specific term in P(a, b) multiplied by Q(c) would be the coefficient of that term in P(a, b) multiplied by the entire Q(c). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, perhaps it's referring to the coefficient when considering all variables. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would require considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, so perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical value, in which case, I need to consider that the entire expression is multiplied, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and since the second part is a separate factor, the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simplistic because the entire expression is the product of both. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would require considering that each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's still a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, meaning that we can ignore the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is just 6. But that seems incorrect because the entire expression is a product, and the second part affects the overall coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would require multiplying the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the coefficient from the second part is the sum of all coefficients, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Let me try to verify this with a small example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is \\(c + 1/c\\). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would also be 1 times \\((c + 1/c)\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). But if I set \\(c = 1\\), the coefficient would be 2, which is the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, in this small example, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is indeed 1 times 2 = 2, which is the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, applying that logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, but does \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) have a term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\)? Because if so, then that term would be a constant and would just multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Let me check that. Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only need the constant term from the second expansion. That makes sense because any term involving \\(c\\) would result in a term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Let me just go through it again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, \\((a + b)^4\\): the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\): the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is when \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Yeah, that seems correct. I don't think I made any errors in the calculations. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For the expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together yields \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " I'm not sure if I need to expand that part as well, or if it's just there to multiply by the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect that coefficient? Hmm, let me think. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when you multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will multiply with each term in the \\((a + b)^4\\) expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms just contribute a factor that we might have to consider. Wait, but no, because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Hmm, that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe the entire expression is being considered, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient isn't just 6, because we have to multiply by something from the second part. Wait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering all terms in the product, but only looking at the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that any term in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), would have that coefficient. But wait, no, that can't be, because the coefficient is just a numerical factor, so if the term is \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it differently. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2 respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would vary depending on the power of \\(c\\). So, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That seems more precise. So, to find this, I can expand both parts separately and then find the product term that gives me \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, first, as I did before, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because \\(c^0 = 1\\), so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), we get \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(c^0\\) occurs is when \\(m = 3\\), and its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, we multiply the coefficients from each expansion. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. Is it correct to just multiply the coefficients from each expansion? Let me think. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. Alternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then the answer would be 6, but I think the way the problem is phrased, it's more likely that we're considering the entire expression, including the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is 120. Let me check again: the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but in the entire product, so any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would vary depending on the power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, I think it's more plausible that it's asking for the coefficient when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, making it a standalone \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, yeah, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed at \\(k=2\\), so \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) is at \\(m=3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Correct. So, multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, yeah, I think that's right.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. So, when you multiply these two polynomials together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6*20=120. So, that's consistent.\n\nI think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these coefficients gives:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and how they multiply with the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But wait, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is a term from the first part, and it's being multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes to different parts of the final expression, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the other variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect it. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to different terms in the final product. But wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but each of those products will have different variables. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\); it only adds factors involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply 6, regardless of the second part. Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when you expand this, each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, each of which has some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) itself is the sum of all those contributions. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Now, what is the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? To find that, we can substitute \\(c = 1\\), because substituting 1 into the expression gives the sum of the coefficients. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems a bit high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire second expansion, each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the other variables are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part's terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6, as I initially thought. Hmm, now I'm confused. Which is correct? Let me try to approach it differently. Let's consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we are only concerned with the terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have exponents 2, regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So, each time \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term from the second expansion, it results in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), and the coefficient for each of these terms is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\) in the second expansion. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the sum of all the coefficients of terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I calculated before, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify any \\(c\\) term. It just says \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the entire expression, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is indeed the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, since the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a sum of coefficients equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\) when \\(c = 1\\), the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

When you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Alternatively, maybe the problem is a product of two separate expansions, and we're only concerned with the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would still involve \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which suggests that it's looking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial in \\(c\\).

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to treat \\(c\\) as a variable independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the second part is just a distraction, but that seems unlikely. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when you multiply by 6, each of those coefficients becomes part of the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. Let me check if that's the case. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but perhaps it's implied that we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, meaning \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would involve both expansions. So, let me proceed under that assumption. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, first, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We need to find the term where the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the final answer is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) times \\(20c^0\\) gives \\(120a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is indeed 120. That makes sense. So, I think that's the correct approach.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " I'm not sure how that affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), though. Wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, right? So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't depend on \\(c\\), I think I just need to consider how the multiplication affects the coefficient. Wait, but actually, when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will produce terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is just a term without any \\(c\\) involved, I think that the coefficient remains 6 because the other terms will have \\(c\\) in them, so when considering the entire expression, the only part contributing to \\(a^2b^2\\) is the 6 from the first part, and the rest would have \\(c\\) terms which we don't care about. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, that is, the entire expansion, I need to consider all possible ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but none of these will have just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the only way to get a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) is if we multiply it by the constant term in the second expansion, which is when \\(c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by this constant term, I get \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me double-check. Is there any other way that \\(a^2b^2\\) could appear in the product? I don't think so because the second part only contributes terms with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second expansion. So, yes, the coefficient should be 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the final answer is 120. Wait, but let me just go through it again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), find the constant term, which is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, multiply these coefficients together because when you multiply the two expansions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Yeah, that seems correct. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens at \\(m = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that when you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply. But in this case, since we're looking for a specific term \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the overall coefficient would be 6 multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, but the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in that expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, you get terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, if I take the 6 from the first part and multiply by 64, I get 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384. Wait, but that seems too high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, and since the second factor doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second part. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me reread it: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify. Alternatively, maybe the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. That would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try another approach. Let's expand both parts separately. First, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives us terms like \\(a^4, 4a^3b, 6a^2b^2, 4ab^3, b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. The sum of the coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific power of \\(c\\), like \\(c^0\\) or something else, then the answer would be different. But since the problem doesn't specify, I think it's safe to assume that it's asking for the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 384. Wait, but let me check this again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = 1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). When I multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in the second part is found by evaluating it at \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\).

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would require multiplying 6 by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, but only for the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term (the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a single number. So, let me try that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as before. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the product of the coefficient from the first part (6) and the constant term from the second part (20). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I did that correctly. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct. I think that's the right approach because otherwise, if I didn't consider the constant term, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense for the answer.

    "text": " Hmm, I notice that this part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when we multiply the two parts together, the terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will combine. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term will come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and any term from the second part. Wait, but actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, it will still be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\text{some terms}\\), when I multiply them together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Alternatively, since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, that's not quite right. Let me clarify: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing to the coefficient. Alternatively, since the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion. Wait, but actually, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, and the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient would just be \\(6\\) times whatever the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is in the second expansion, because when you multiply by \\(c^0\\), you don't change the exponent of \\(c\\), but since we're only looking at \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), maybe I should consider the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero in the second expansion. Let me check that. So, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(c^0\\), the resulting term will be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient from the second part where \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Wait, so which approach is correct? Earlier, I thought the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384, but now I'm getting 120. Hmm, I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. When we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too high. Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the role of \\(c\\) here. Wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\) factors, so when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term in the second expansion that has \\(c^k\\), the result is \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's actually the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in every term of the product where it's multiplied by any term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems to contradict the other approach where I considered only the \\(c^0\\) term. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but in the entire expression, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, if the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times 64, which is 384. But if the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120. I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, so 384. But wait, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), you get a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, if you're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's the sum over all \\(k\\) of (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in first part) times (coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in second part). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120. Hmm, I think I need to clarify. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but in the entire expression, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in multiple terms, each multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times 64, which is 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. But the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too large. Let me check my reasoning again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is simply the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yes, it's 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, let's think about it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so that part is 6, as before. Then, for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, we have a term \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when we multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But if we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then we need to sum over all \\(m\\) the coefficients \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). That is, 6 times the sum from \\(m=0\\) to \\(m=6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but I'm now confusing myself because earlier I thought it was 120. Let me try to see which approach is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. But the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check with an example. Suppose we have a simpler case: \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\). In this case, the first part is \\(a + b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1. The second part is \\(c + 1/c\\), whose sum of coefficients is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1 times 2, which is 2. But if we expand the product, it's \\(a \\times c + a \\times (1/c) + b \\times c + b \\times (1/c)\\), so the terms are \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 in \\(ac\\) and 1 in \\(a/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is 2, which matches the earlier result. So, in this simpler case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 2, which is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part. Therefore, applying that logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, in the problem, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), whose sum of coefficients is indeed 64. So, that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times 64, which is 384. But earlier, I thought it was 120, but that was under the assumption that we were looking for the term where \\(c^0\\), which would be 20. So, which is correct? It depends on what the problem is asking. Since the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any condition on \\(c\\), it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But I'm a bit uncertain because sometimes when problems involve multiple variables, they might be asking for a specific term, but in this case, the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's safe to go with 384. Wait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) can be any integer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(k\\) of (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\)). But that's not the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, it's indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 384. But wait, earlier I thought it was 120, so I need to resolve this confusion. Let me try to think of another approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me denote \\(S = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times S\\). Now, when we expand \\((a + b)^4 \\times S\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(S\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(S\\). Because each term in \\(S\\) contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(S\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(S(1) = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that seems to confirm it. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, earlier I thought that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be multiplied by the \\(c^0\\) term, but that's not the case because the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(S\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(S\\), which is 64, giving 384. Therefore, the final answer is 384. But wait, I'm going to check with an example. Let me take a simpler case where I can compute manually. Let me take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). Now, multiplying these together:\n\n\\[\n(a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c) = a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\n\\]\n\nNow, looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\). That would be the coefficient of \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\), which are both 1. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is 1 + 1 = 2, which is the coefficient from the first part (1) times the sum of coefficients in the second part (1 + 1 = 2), so 1 * 2 = 2, which matches. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2c + 2/c, so the coefficient of \\(ab\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is 2 + 2 = 4, which is the coefficient from the first part (2) times the sum of coefficients in the second part (2), so 2 * 2 = 4, which is correct. So, applying this logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120, so I must have made a mistake in my initial reasoning. Let me go through it again. The key is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, every term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second expansion, you get a term of the form \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), and the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all \\(k\\) is the sum of all those contributions, which is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part. Therefore, the correct answer is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think I can confidently say that the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check one more time. Let's compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and see what the sum of coefficients is. As I did before, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. Yes, that seems correct. So, I think I've convinced myself that the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " I'm not sure how that affects the \\(a^2b^2\\) term because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are different variables. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the part with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. That is, maybe I just need to consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately and then multiply them together. But wait, when you multiply two expressions, you have to consider all possible products of terms from each expression. However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents, meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the \\(c\\) terms can be anything, but as long as the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents are 2 each, the coefficient is what we're after. Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, let's compute that. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check that again because I might be making a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is actually just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of some term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not clear. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, we're looking for terms where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and the rest of the variables are whatever they are, but the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, but no, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that includes any power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a numerical factor. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. Let me confirm this approach. So, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, since the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), but that's not specified. Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\)) because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense for a single coefficient value. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expansion. That would make sense. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply them together.\n\nOkay, so let's break it down. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), as I found earlier.\n\nNext, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find this, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, it's the product of the coefficients from each part: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when I considered the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) part, which would give me 64, leading to 6 * 64 = 384. But now, by considering the constant term in \\(c\\), I get 20, leading to 6 * 20 = 120. So, which is correct?\n\nI think the confusion comes from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms or specifically the coefficient when multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Since the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. However, in the context of such problems, usually, they're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would mean that it's 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense as a single coefficient. Therefore, it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let's consider the entire expansion. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6. But that seems too simple, and the presence of the \\(c\\) terms suggests that the problem is more involved.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Let me see which interpretation makes more sense.\n\nIn the problem statement, it's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when expanded, each term would be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m (1/c)^n\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m + n = 6\\). But when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're looking for all terms where \\(k = 2\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\), and any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, leading to 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 384, which is a constant, but in reality, the product would have terms with various powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense as a single numerical coefficient. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but I'm getting conflicting conclusions here. Let me try to think differently. Let's consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and not the \\(c\\) parts, so the coefficient is just 6. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for similar problems or think about how such coefficients are treated. When you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all terms in the product where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 384, which is a constant, but in reality, when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you're introducing terms with various powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused because different interpretations lead to different answers. Let me try to think of it another way. Suppose I expand both parts:\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2/c^2\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) terms) is 6 * 20 = 120, because the constant term in \\(c\\) is 20. So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6*(64) = 384, but that would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense as a single coefficient. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but in the initial expansion, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when considering the sum of all coefficients, which would be incorrect because the problem is asking for a specific term, not the sum. So, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me think about it again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*(64) = 384. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, which isn't possible. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and not considering the \\(c\\) terms at all. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something like that, but as it is, it's \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense as a single coefficient. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check once more. If I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), it's ambiguous. However, in standard problems, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product, and the term includes variables from both factors, you need to specify all variables. Since the problem only specifies \\(a^2b^2\\), it's possible that it's asking for the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the \\(c\\) part, which is 6*64=384. But that seems high. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I can look for similar problems. For example, if you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, because that's the only way to get \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   Thus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), i.e., \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   Thus, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
