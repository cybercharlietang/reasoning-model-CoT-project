    "text": " Similarly, I can expand this using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Wait, actually, the entire expression is the product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply the two expressions, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) from the second part. Because if you take any other term from the second part, like \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which aren't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I found earlier as 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that won't add or subtract an exponent of \\(c\\). So, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). From the expansion I did earlier, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, I need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).

Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to worry about the other terms. Let me think: when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, but when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when expanding, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, but that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I do that, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems high. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all the terms from both expansions. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, no, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense because then we're looking for a specific term where \\(c\\) cancels out. So, let me re-express the problem: find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That seems more plausible. So, in that case, I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, let me think about how that would work.\n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the term where \\(c^k\\) such that when multiplied by \\(c^{-k}\\) (from \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\)), it results in \\(c^0\\). Wait, no, more accurately, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to get \\(c^0\\), we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part, which has a coefficient of 20. So, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^m} = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). To get \\(c^0\\), we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when we multiply the two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part, which has a coefficient of 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming it's \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the original problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I was wrong earlier, and the problem is indeed just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the problem statement is unclear. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense for a numerical answer. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, the answer would be 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so that the coefficient is a number. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but then the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another approach. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is the product of the two coefficients, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made a mistake in calculating the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to get \\(c^0\\), we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, I think the problem must have intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but then the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense for a numerical answer. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second polynomial, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. But the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and it's not considering the specific power of \\(c\\). Therefore, I think that approach is incorrect.\n\nSo, to summarize, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another way. Let's consider that when you have two separate polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the product of the two coefficients, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   To find the term where \\(c^0\\), set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), giving \\(m = 3\\).

Wait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when you expand it, each term will be of the form (a^kb^{4 - k}) times (c^m (1/c)^{6 - m}) or something like that.

The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product as 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some term involving \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, maybe it's just the coefficient when considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only, and treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum over all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would vary depending on the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out.

So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term from the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion.

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel each other out, so that the product doesn't contribute any \\(c\\) terms. In other words, we need the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when we multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), it won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of 6 and 20, which is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. I think that makes sense. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, since we're multiplying the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, it's only the constant term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120 is correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Simplifying each term, that would be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the original expression is the product of these two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply them together, I'm essentially multiplying each term from the first expansion by each term from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part. So, does that mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\)? Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, to get a term involving \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by each term from the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, that term would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, and the exponents add. But in this case, the first part has variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part has variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the variables are separate. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, the coefficients add. Wait, no, actually, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are all terms in \\(c\\). Therefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which isn't possible because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficients add up. So, to find the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to compute 6 (the coefficient from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Now, how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, let me substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so I think it's safe to assume that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times 64, so 384. Let me double-check my reasoning. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms that are multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so each term in the second expansion adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), then we would have to find the specific term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, I think 384 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, no, because the entire expression is a product of two parts. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of the first part is multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part.

Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. If I have two separate polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate variable. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not right either because each term in the second polynomial is a separate term involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Hmm, I'm getting confused here. Let me try to approach it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, when we multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), it means that in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Wait, that makes sense because when you multiply by a polynomial, each term is scaled by the coefficients of the other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But how do I find the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me double-check that. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), then when I multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. So, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion of the entire expression.

But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something like that, but it's not specified. Wait, the problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps we can treat \\(c\\) as another variable, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Wait, maybe the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the other terms involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which might not be what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, which would require multiplying the coefficients. Wait, but in the product, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient should be a number. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all terms, but the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so maybe the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. Wait, that might make sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply by a polynomial, each term is scaled by the coefficients of the other polynomial. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. That seems plausible. Let me verify this. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has various terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since we're multiplying the entire second polynomial by the first polynomial, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, as calculated earlier. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. I think that makes sense now. So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we consider the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these results gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

Now, I notice that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but this expansion is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, so when I multiply the two expansions together, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be a term from the first expansion multiplied by a term from the second expansion. But since the variables are different (\\(a, b\\) vs. \\(c\\)), the multiplication will just be the product of the coefficients.

Wait, why \\(c^0\\)? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by some term in the other expansion, you want the entire term to be just \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a constant, not involving \\(c\\). So, the term in the second expansion that's a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) will contribute that constant factor to the coefficient. Alternatively, if the term in the second expansion had a \\(c\\) term, then the overall expression would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but since the problem only asks for \\(a^2b^2\\), we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let me find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent is zero. That happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\).

When you multiply these together, you get 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of the two expansions, so each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. Since the variables are separate, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20.

That is, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it will just be multiplied by some coefficient from the second expansion, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I can consider the coefficient as the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, no, actually, that might not be correct. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. However, the terms from the second expansion involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but each of these terms will be separate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, regardless of the second part because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) variables. Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Actually, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. Wait, but that can't be, because the second part is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but each of these would be separate terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the entire second part. Wait, that can't be correct because the second part is not a constant. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all different, the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but as written, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be, because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, which would be 6. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify. Wait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without any \\(c\\) terms, which suggests that it's considering terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., where the term is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is the term where the exponent is zero. Let me find that. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that's the coefficient. Let me double-check that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will contribute to the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   Since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part must be multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) in the second part to get the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the overall coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of the two expansions. Wait, but actually, the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), while the terms in \\((a + b)^4\\) are in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when we multiply these two expressions together, the variables involved are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that the terms involving \\(c\\) might not affect this coefficient. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean we're looking for the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has a coefficient, but the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) would multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\), so unless \\(c\\) terms somehow cancel out, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a \\(c\\) term. So, unless the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that's not standard. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be the product of the two expansions. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first expansion, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of those products would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps we're supposed to consider only the constant term in the second expansion? Because if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that can't be right because each term in the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would have a different power of \\(c\\). So, unless the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in the second expansion. That would make sense because then the term would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (constant term). So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. Let me check that approach. So, first, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). For this to be a constant term, the exponent must be zero. So, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the term in the entire expression that is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20, so when you multiply them, you get 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering all possible terms, but in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because each term in the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\), so they don't combine with \\(a^2b^2\\) to form a single term. Therefore, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when the second expansion contributes its constant term. So, I think 120 is the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps. 1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. 2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). 3. Multiply the two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

Wait, but that's not right because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the variables are different. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient in the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part.

Wait, perhaps the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would have the same coefficient.

But that doesn't make sense numerically because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has multiple terms, each with their own coefficients. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me think again. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. That doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, no, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Hmm, maybe the problem is intended to consider only the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too high. Let me check that again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all coefficients in that expansion. So, if I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by 64, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but without any specific power of \\(c\\), so maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the expansion, but that seems odd. Wait, maybe I should think differently. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, and when multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it becomes \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems a bit counterintuitive. Let me check with a smaller example to see if this approach is correct. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The expansion of \\((c + 1/c)\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). Now, multiplying these together, we get \\(a^2c + a^2(1/c) + 2ab c + 2ab(1/c) + b^2c + b^2(1/c)\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in this product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^2\\) times the sum of the coefficients from \\((c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\) is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2, which is correct because in the product, the \\(a^2\\) terms are \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2(1/c)\\), each with coefficient 1, so total coefficient is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2 * 2 = 4. Looking at the product, the \\(ab\\) terms are \\(2ab c\\) and \\(2ab (1/c)\\), each with coefficient 2, so total coefficient is 4. So, this approach seems to work. Therefore, applying it to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me double-check the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of coefficients, we set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because the problem involves both \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and I'm not sure if I'm interpreting the question correctly. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but considering only the terms where \\(c\\) is raised to a specific power. But since the problem doesn't specify, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a specific term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but without more information, I think the correct approach is to consider the coefficient as 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384. Wait, but let me think again. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we're only looking at the part of the product that involves \\(a^2b^2\\) and not worrying about the \\(c\\) part. But in that case, the coefficient would just be 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that seems unlikely because the entire product includes both parts. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a typo, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. In that case, we would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), because the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), and setting the exponent to 0 gives \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product would be 6 * 20 = 120. That seems more reasonable. So, perhaps the problem intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but it was written as \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct as written, and I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to clarify. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Since the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), without mentioning \\(c\\). Therefore, in the context of the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384. Wait, but let me confirm this with another approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire product as a product of two polynomials and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the two polynomials are in different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

Simplifying that, each term would be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the entire original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, I'm essentially multiplying each term from the first expansion with each term from the second expansion. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so that means I only need to consider the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and then the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) can be anything because the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but the product also involves terms with \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but since \\(c\\) terms are separate, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). Wait, that might not be right. Let me think again. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so that term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think I need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\left(\\dbinom{6}{0} + \\dbinom{6}{1} + \\dbinom{6}{2} + \\dbinom{6}{3} + \\dbinom{6}{4} + \\dbinom{6}{5} + \\dbinom{6}{6}\\right)\\). Wait, but that can't be right because each term in the product would have different powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all terms, so perhaps I need to consider each term in the product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), but the problem didn't specify any particular \\(c\\) term, so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Which is 6 * (sum from m=0 to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\)) which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient, and when multiplied by the coefficient from the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any \\(c\\) term would just be the product of the two coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem didn't specify, so I think it's safe to assume that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.

So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is from the second part. But wait, actually, no. Because the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion.

So, maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because they're separate variables. Wait, that might not be right. Let me think again. The expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. So, when you multiply them, each term from the first part (\\(a + b)^4\\)) is multiplied by each term from the second part (\\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients from the second part.

But since the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that might not be accurate. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are just part of the overall expression, but since they are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in the first part, because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be present in all those products, but the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. But the entire expression is the product of two polynomials. So, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore the terms in the second polynomial because they involve \\(c\\), which is a different variable. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, which is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), because the sum of coefficients is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the expression is a product of two independent polynomials, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, as the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by every possible term from the second polynomial. So, that would make the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6. But that seems unlikely because the expression is the product of two polynomials, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial. Wait, but let me think again. Let me take a simpler example. Suppose I have (a + b)^2 * (c + 1/c)^1. Then, the coefficient of a^2b^2 would be the same as in (a + b)^2, which is 1, because in the product, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2, regardless of the c terms, it's just the coefficient from the first part. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 1, not 1*(1 + 1) = 2. Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. So, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Let me think again. Wait, in the expression (a + b)^2*(c + 1/c), when you expand it, you get terms like a^2c, a^2*(1/c), ab*c, ab*(1/c), b^2c, b^2*(1/c). So, the term a^2b^2 doesn't exist because the second polynomial only has terms with c and 1/c, but no constants. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 would actually be zero because there's no term in the second polynomial that's a constant. Wait, that's different. So, in that case, the coefficient would be zero, not 1*2=2. So, that changes things. So, in the original problem, the second polynomial is (c + 1/c)^6. When we expand that, the terms would be of the form c^k*(1/c)^{6 - k} = c^{2k - 6}. So, the exponents of c would be even numbers ranging from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. But in any case, none of the terms in the second polynomial would be a constant term unless 2k - 6 = 0, which would be when k = 3. So, the term when k=3 would be \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{3}*(1/c)^{3}\\) = \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0}\\) = 20*1 = 20. So, the constant term in the second polynomial is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two polynomials together, the term a^2b^2 from the first polynomial would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but only the constant term (20) would contribute to the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product. All other terms in the second polynomial would result in terms that have c or 1/c, which would make the overall term have those variables, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2, regardless of the c terms. Wait, but actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the entire expression, which includes all terms. So, if the expression is (a + b)^4*(c + 1/c)^6, then the term a^2b^2 would be present in the product, but it would be multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2, which is a term in the product, but since the second polynomial includes terms with c and 1/c, the term a^2b^2 would actually be multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, resulting in terms like a^2b^2c^k. Therefore, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the entire expression would actually be zero because there's no term in the product that has a^2b^2 without any c terms. Wait, that can't be right because when you multiply, you get terms like a^2b^2 multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, so the coefficient of a^2b^2 would actually be the same as the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial. Wait, but in the example I did earlier, with (a + b)^2*(c + 1/c), the coefficient of a^2b^2 would be zero because there's no constant term in the second polynomial except when k=3, which gives a constant term of 20. So, in that case, the coefficient of a^2b^2 would be 1*20 = 20. Wait, that makes sense because the term a^2b^2 would be multiplied by the constant term 20, resulting in 20a^2b^2. So, in that case, the coefficient is 20. So, applying that logic to the original problem, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in (a + b)^4*(c + 1/c)^6 would be the coefficient of a^2b^2 in (a + b)^4 multiplied by the constant term in (c + 1/c)^6. So, from earlier, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in (a + b)^4 is 6. The constant term in (c + 1/c)^6 is when the exponent of c is zero. So, in the expansion of (c + 1/c)^6, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{k}*(1/c)^{6 - k}\\) = \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{2k - 6}\\). We need 2k - 6 = 0, so k = 3. Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) = 20. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that makes sense because only the constant term in the second polynomial would contribute to the a^2b^2 term in the product. All other terms would have c or 1/c, so they wouldn't contribute to the a^2b^2 term. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just double-check. The coefficient of a^2b^2 in (a + b)^4 is 6. The constant term in (c + 1/c)^6 is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by considering the contributions from each part of the product.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), giving the coefficient:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The general term in the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{2k - 6}\n   \\]\n   For the term to be constant (\\(c^0\\)), set \\(2k - 6 = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), because those would be part of other terms in the product.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate expression. Wait, no, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, and then all the terms are added together. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times each of those. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, that can't be right because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that seems too broad. Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire product, any term that is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second expansion would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again.

The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the second part is a separate expression that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion.

But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and not \\(c\\), that must mean that the term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\), so it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part. So, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which means \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of the \\(c^0\\) term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that's a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. I don't think there are any other terms in the second expansion that would affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term because any other term would have a power of \\(c\\), which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yeah, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by expanding each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0), which occurs at \\(m = 3\\) and has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " I notice that the second part of the expression is multiplied by the first part, so the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I have to consider them as well? Hmm, let me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the second part is another binomial expansion. So, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe we can treat the second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, that might not be correct because the second part is a separate variable. Let me clarify: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression also includes \\(c\\) terms. However, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by any term from the second part. But wait, when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by whatever comes from the second part. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6, and it's multiplied by the entire second part. But wait, that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think is just the coefficient without considering \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term, it's with respect to all variables. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Because otherwise, the coefficient would include \\(c\\) terms, which seems unusual. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, but that also doesn't sound right. Wait, let me think again. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but since \\(c\\) is another variable, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a bit strange because it's not a constant. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, meaning \\(c^0\\), so that the coefficient is a constant. That might make more sense. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Let me check that interpretation. If that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together. That would give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product. That seems plausible. So, let's go with that interpretation. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it by considering \\(c\\). Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expression, which would make it a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that doesn't seem right because usually, when you're asked for a coefficient, it's a constant. So, perhaps the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), as I did earlier, which gives 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is not a constant. That seems unlikely. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first polynomial, and we need to multiply it by the term in the second polynomial that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which is the constant term, which we found to be 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), \\(k = 3\\), as I found before. So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). That's correct. So, the coefficient is indeed 20. Therefore, multiplying by the 6 from the first part, we get 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is actually a sum over all the terms in the second expansion. Wait, but that's not correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. So, in reality, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right either. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the terms in each expression that combine to form that term. But in this case, since the first expression is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in terms of \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes only from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the entire expansion of the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, that makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the original coefficient times each coefficient from the second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, no, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term in the second expansion is a term like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), you get a term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. Wait, that's a good point. So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponents cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. When you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expansion as the product of two separate expansions, and when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only affected by the constant term in the second expansion because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) component, which would change the term to something like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Now, I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the second part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, but \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables. So, when I multiply the two expanded expressions together, I need to consider how the terms combine. Specifically, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. When you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion will be a sum over all possible products of terms from each expansion. So, each term will look like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the first expansion, as I found earlier. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is 6. Now, when I multiply this by the second expansion, each term from the second expansion will be multiplied by 6. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. The entire expression is a product of two independent expressions, so when you multiply them, the variables are independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that can't be right because the second expansion includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the second expansion's terms are all in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and they don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would only come from the term where the second expansion is 1, right? Wait, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc., but none of these terms are constants unless \\(c^0\\). So, actually, the only way to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is if the second expansion's term is \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that won't introduce any \\(c\\) dependence, allowing \\(a^2b^2\\) to stand alone. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial expansion, as I did earlier, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Since these are multiplied together in the product, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part, when expanded, has a term \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. So when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that term, I get \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2\\), which is 120\\(a^2b^2\\). That seems correct. Alternatively, if I thought about the entire product, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion, but only the constant term in the second expansion doesn't introduce any \\(c\\) terms, so only that term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) involved. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of each part separately and then combining the relevant coefficients.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   Multiply the coefficients from each expansion: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " I notice that this part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so it's separate. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to consider this part when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, when we multiply the two expressions together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables. Wait, no, actually, I think I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we can consider the expression as a product of two parts: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't depend on the \\(c\\) terms, maybe I just need to find the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then involve \\(c\\) terms, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that seems unlikely because \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms, but without considering \\(c\\). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right either. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form (something involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) multiplied by (something involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means I need to find all terms where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts are \\(a^2b^2\\), and then the \\(c\\) parts can be anything, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's considering the entire product, so the coefficient would be the coefficient from the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part multiplied by the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expansion, treating all variables together, but that seems complicated because \\(c\\) is separate. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all possible coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right either because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate term. Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would just be 6, because the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve considering the \\(c\\) terms as well. Let me try to think of it another way. When you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is not a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) alone, which is 6, and then considering that the other part is separate. But that seems odd because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some term from the \\(c\\) part, but without specifying the \\(c\\) term, that's unclear. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, meaning that we have to consider all possible terms, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is something, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), perhaps the answer is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the \\(c\\) part, but that doesn't make sense because each term in the product would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) part, which is a polynomial, not a single coefficient. I'm getting confused here. Let me try to approach it differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the part with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the \\(c\\) part is irrelevant for this particular term. Wait, that might make sense. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the expression is a product of two parts, maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part, which is 6, and the \\(c\\) part is separate. So, the answer would be 6. But I'm not entirely sure because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is being multiplied, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would involve multiplying by the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) part. But that would make the coefficient a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would just be 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate and don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. That seems plausible. Let me check that. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion would actually be the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that's not correct because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so I must have misunderstood. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering only the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, which would just be 6. But that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that would require more information. Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted as asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would just be 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. So, maybe the answer is 6. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part is just a distraction. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, but since the \\(c\\) terms are separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) part, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), but that seems incorrect because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is not 64. Wait, no, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too large. Wait, but if I set \\(c = 1\\), the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach because the problem isn't asking for the value when \\(c = 1\\), it's asking for the coefficient in the expansion. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it again. Let me try to think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4\\), and so on. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion would be the sum of all these coefficients. But that would mean the coefficient is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part is irrelevant. Alternatively, maybe the problem is a misstatement, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but the question is only about \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the answer is 6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, I think the answer is 6. Wait, but earlier I thought about setting \\(c = 1\\) to find the sum of coefficients, but that might not be the right approach. Let me try to confirm. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), specifically \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be this entire expression. However, that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part is just a distraction. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, but without any \\(c\\) terms, which would require multiplying 6 by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That occurs when we choose an equal number of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. So, in the expansion, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), would be 6 times 20, which is 120. But the problem didn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so I'm not sure if that's the intended approach. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it would just be 6. But given that the problem includes both parts, I think the more accurate approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) part, but since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's intended to consider the constant term in the \\(c\\) part, which is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part is irrelevant. I'm a bit confused here, but I think the most likely intended answer is 6, as the problem is primarily about \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the \\(c\\) part is just another factor. So, maybe the coefficient is 6. Alternatively, if I consider that the entire expression is being expanded, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would involve multiplying by all the terms from the \\(c\\) part, but that would result in a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. So, I think the answer is 6.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion being 20, so 6 times 20 is 120. Maybe that's the intended answer. Let me check that again. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, and considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120. But the problem didn't specify that it's looking for the constant term, so perhaps that's not the right approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would just be 6. I think I need to clarify this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part is just another factor that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. So, I think the answer is 6.\n\nWait, but I'm still not entirely sure. Let me try to think of it another way. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is this polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's intended to consider the constant term, which is 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6. I think I need to consider the problem statement again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since the product includes terms with \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), but that's not a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part is just another factor. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is misworded, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something similar, in which case it would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, but without any \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 20, so 120. Given that, I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Then, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too high. Alternatively, if I consider the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 20, then 6 times 20 is 120. I think that's more likely what the problem is asking for. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm still not sure. Let me try to think of it as a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4\\), which has terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\). The second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). When you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's this expression. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's intended to consider the constant term, which is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) alone, which is 6, and the other part is just another factor. So, perhaps the answer is 6. But given the way the problem is phrased, I think the more accurate answer is 120, considering the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion. Therefore, I'll go with 120 as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but let me check again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product, each term is a combination of terms from both polynomials. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too high, and I don't think that's the intended approach because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not the sum of coefficients.\n\nWait, I'm getting conflicting results here. Let me try to clarify. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part is just another factor. So, the answer is 6.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense as a numerical coefficient. Therefore, the answer is 6.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives us 6. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) and not considering the \\(c\\) terms, the answer is 6.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{6}."

    "text": " Similarly, I can expand this using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which we've already expanded, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\right)\\). Now, since multiplication distributes over addition, this becomes a double sum: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term. So, in this double sum, I need to find the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. From the first part, as I found earlier, that happens when \\(k = 2\\), so \\(a^{4 - 2}b^2 = a^2b^2\\). Now, for the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). But since the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when we multiply the two expansions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) part doesn't matter for that specific coefficient. Wait, actually, I think I'm making a mistake here. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which includes \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and not involving \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficients add when the exponents match. But in this case, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, that makes sense because when you multiply by a term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), you're effectively scaling the entire coefficient by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Now, what's the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, that seems high. Let me check my reasoning again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but since the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that when you multiply by the second part, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is indeed 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Hmm, but let me think again: when you have two polynomials, say P(a, b) and Q(c), then the coefficient of a specific term in P(a, b) multiplied by Q(c) would be the coefficient in P(a, b) times the sum of the coefficients in Q(c). Because each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q, so the coefficient of a term in P is scaled by the sum of coefficients in Q. So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me confirm with a different approach. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, so 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but since the second part is a separate variable, the coefficient remains 6 times 64. Hmm, that seems consistent.
