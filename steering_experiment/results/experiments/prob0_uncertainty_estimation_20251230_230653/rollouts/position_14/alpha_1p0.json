    "text": " Wait, does that part affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't think the terms involving \\(c\\) will affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, actually, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we're considering the entire expression, so maybe we need to consider how the \\(a^2b^2\\) term combines with all the terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times\\) something. Wait, but the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate term, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps it's just \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check if I'm doing this correctly. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire product, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients in the second expression is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64, as I thought before. So, 6 times 64 is 384. But I'm a bit unsure because the problem might just be asking for the coefficient in the product, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^m \\times (1/c)^n\\), where \\(m + n = 6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, yes, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression, so perhaps the coefficient is just 6 because the other part doesn't affect \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term is multiplied by each term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, which includes all the terms involving \\(c\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand it, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, so when you multiply by the second part, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer is 384. But wait, let me confirm that. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it. But that seems incorrect because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Yeah, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Wait, does that part affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part. So, maybe the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of the two expansions, so each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that term must come from the first expansion multiplied by the constant term (the term without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\)) from the second expansion. So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that constant term, I'll get a term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, and that will be the only term contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, let me work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these two terms multiply together, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the product of the two expansions will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{6 - 2m} \\times \\text{something}\\), but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which is in the first part, and in the second part, we need the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which is the constant term. So, yes, the coefficient should be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when you multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, that only comes from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion, and any term in the second expansion. But since the second expansion has only \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), it doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but maybe I should check if there's another way to approach this. Let me try expanding both parts separately and see. First, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that a bit. The expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^5 \\times (1/c) + 15c^4 \\times (1/c)^2 + 20c^3 \\times (1/c)^3 + 15c^2 \\times (1/c)^4 + 6c \\times (1/c)^5 + (1/c)^6\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, the constant term is 20, which matches what I found earlier. So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is 6a^2b^2, and it gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient remains 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, I think 120 is the correct coefficient. Wait, but just to be thorough, let me think if there's any other term in the second expansion that could affect the coefficient. But no, because the second expansion only has powers of \\(c\\), which are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't change. Therefore, only the constant term in the second expansion affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yes, 120 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, perhaps the second part just needs to be considered separately, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the entire expression would have that term multiplied by the expansion of the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part would contribute a factor that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so maybe it's just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the product of both expansions. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the second part can be anything because it doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, actually, the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, times the entire sum of the coefficients from the second part, because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that might be correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but is that the case? Let me think again. When you have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which would be terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), each multiplied by their respective coefficients. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c^6 + \\dfrac{6}{1}c^4 + \\dfrac{15}{c^2} + \\dfrac{20}{c^0} + \\dfrac{15}{c^{-2}} + \\dfrac{6}{c^{-4}} + \\dfrac{1}{c^{-6}}\\right)\\). Wait, but that's not correct because the coefficients of the second expansion are different. Let me actually compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) correctly using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\). So, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by this, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, giving \\(6a^2b^2 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each of these terms, but each of these terms has different powers of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in different parts of the product. Wait, no, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, actually, the only term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Let me verify that. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) is 20. So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) gets multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120 for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. All other terms in the second expansion would result in \\(a^2b^2\\) being multiplied by a term with \\(c\\) raised to some power, so those wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is there another way to think about this? Maybe by considering the entire expansion and looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part. So, yes, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if I were to collect all terms in the product that have \\(a^2b^2\\), they would all have different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, that's not correct. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we are considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some coefficient, and that term would also have some power of \\(c\\). But perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient when considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term, which would only occur when multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, I think my initial conclusion is correct: the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The constant term (term with \\(c^0\\)) in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives the coefficient as \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect that coefficient. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, no, actually, when you multiply the two expressions, each term in the product will be a product of terms from each expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which are terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, because the second part doesn't contribute any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient is just 6. But that seems too simple. Let me think again. Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the coefficient of the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, but without any \\(c\\) terms. So, that would be when the term from the second part is the constant term, i.e., when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me find that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the term from the second part that is a constant is 20. So, when we multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part, which has coefficient 6, by the constant term 20 from the second part, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. Wait, but I'm not sure if I did that right. Let me check again. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply the two expressions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, including the constant term 20. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will have a coefficient that includes all the contributions from the second part. Wait, but no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, which includes terms with \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would only be multiplied by the constant term from the second part to remain as \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms from the second part would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and the exponents of \\(c\\) are 0. So, that would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), giving 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. I think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term (with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. The coefficients multiply, so 6 times 20 is 120. Yeah, that makes sense.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " I'm not sure if that affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it because they're multiplied together. Let me think. If I have two expressions multiplied, like \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the entire expression is the product of those two. So, when you multiply them, each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not involving \\(c\\), perhaps the second part just gets multiplied as a whole. Wait, that might not be correct. Let me check. Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, you get terms involving \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe the only way that \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear is if it's multiplied by a term in the second part that is \\(c^0\\), i.e., 1. Because then \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\) would just be \\(a^2b^2\\), and its coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from both parts. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part. That sounds more accurate. So, let me proceed step by step. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, let's tackle the second part: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the one with \\(c^0\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the coefficient from the second part where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 (which is 20). So, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Because sometimes when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients just multiply, but I want to make sure that in this case, since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), and not involving \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, yes, the coefficient should be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expression, it's a product of two polynomials. Each term in the first polynomial is \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) with coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\), and each term in the second polynomial is \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) with coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). When we multiply them, the exponents add, so for \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), which we've already found. Then, for the second part, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, which happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, that seems correct. Alternatively, if I were to expand both parts and multiply, but that would be more complicated, and I think my reasoning is sound. So, the coefficient is 120. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but let me double-check the binomial coefficients. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, correct. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, correct. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Yeah, that seems right.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient for this term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both parts:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), right? So, when you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that's \\(6a^2b^2\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times whatever the coefficient is for the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that right? Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the terms in the second expression that are constants because any \\(c\\) terms would make the product have variables, but since we're looking for just \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms must cancel out, meaning their exponents must be zero. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to find that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the exponent to be zero because we're looking for the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that's \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. When you multiply these two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first expression gets multiplied by the constant term 20 in the second expression, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is indeed 120. I think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the product would be a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second.

Since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6, because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Hmm, I'm confused now. Let me try a different approach. Let's expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately. For \\((a + b)^4\\), as I did before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get a product where each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need the terms where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the \\(c\\) part, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can sum over all possible \\(m\\) values. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that seems too large. Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Wait, no, because in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But perhaps that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider only the constant term in \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify that. It just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, if that's the case, then the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But let me check this again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the variable part, it would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think differently. Suppose I consider the entire product as two separate parts: the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part, and the \\(c\\) part. Since they are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, yes, that would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\)), then I would have to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would be when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Then, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. But the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Hmm, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me check another way. Let's consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6a^2b^2 + ... and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as 1 + 6c + 15c^2 + 20c^3 + 15c^4 + 6c^5 + c^6 + ... and all the terms with negative exponents as well. But when we multiply 6a^2b^2 by each of these terms, each will contribute to the coefficient of a^2b^2, but with different powers of c. So, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2, regardless of c, then it's 6 multiplied by the entire sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient in the first part, but I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient in the entire product, which would involve considering all the terms from the second expansion. So, I think the answer is 384. But to make sure, let me see if there's another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have us consider only the constant term in c, so that the coefficient of a^2b^2c^0 would be 120, as I thought earlier. But since the problem didn't specify c, I think it's safer to assume that it's asking for the coefficient regardless of c, so 384. Hmm, but now I'm second-guessing myself. Maybe I should go back to the original problem statement. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's not specifying anything about c, so it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible terms with any power of c. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is just 6, because the other part doesn't affect the a and b terms. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term is multiplied by every term, so the coefficient would be multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of the other polynomial. So, yes, I think it's 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of this coefficient and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\).

Let me re-read the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But since the product also includes terms with \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make more sense because then we're looking for a specific term. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because then the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps I need to clarify. Let me consider that maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, considering all possible terms, but only looking at the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is obtained by setting all variables to 1. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by substituting \\(c = 1\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would mean that each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then we're looking for a specific term in the expansion where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have exponent 2 each, and \\(c\\) has exponent 0. So, let me approach it that way. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found earlier to be 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once we have both coefficients, multiply them together to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That makes sense. So, let me compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the answer should be 120. Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, if I didn't consider the \\(c\\) terms and just multiplied the entire expansion, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a single coefficient. So, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. **Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. This happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients:**\n   Multiply the two coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, maybe the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)? Because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are different variables. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as in the first part, which is 6. But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply as well. But in this case, the first part has terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part has terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since these are different variables, the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with those in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is for the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) in the second part. Wait, but in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term, i.e., the term without \\(c\\), would be when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel each other out. Let me check that. Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient for the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, and each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which comes from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial contributes a constant term, which is 20. So, yes, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the entire expansion. Let me see: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found. Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, I don't care about the \\(c\\) terms, so I only consider the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 20. So, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the entire expression as a product, and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficients for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems correct. I don't think I made a mistake here.

Wait, no, because the entire expression is multiplied together, so every term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other expression is in \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 multiplied by whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because we're looking for the term where the \\(c\\) parts don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts.

So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then I would have to sum over all possible coefficients from the \\(c\\) expression. But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but in the original problem statement, it's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the entire product is a polynomial in \\(a, b, c, 1/c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would mean that in the expansion, we need to find all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and then sum the coefficients from all such terms, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will contribute a coefficient that gets multiplied by 6. But wait, no, that's not correct because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). But if I multiply 6 by 64, I get 384, which seems too large. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would require considering the product of the two expansions. But that might not be necessary because \\(a, b, c\\) are different variables, so the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because I might be misapplying the concept. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's a separate variable. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, maybe I should think differently. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would involve considering that each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64, as I thought earlier, so 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me check that again. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, that part is correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe only the constant term in the second expansion would contribute, but no, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms will have their own coefficients, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all those products, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Therefore, the answer should be 384. Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but since \\(a, b, c\\) are separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear once, multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion.

Wait, that might make sense. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second, the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the first part, and the second part could contribute any term, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it doesn't matter what the \\(c\\) terms are because they're separate variables. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems off because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. So, that would mean I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me check that. So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, it's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, since the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when we multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we only take the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Hmm, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean that the coefficient would be \\(6\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient would be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) actually a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's just 6 times the entire expansion, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, meaning \\(c^0\\). So, that would make sense, as I thought earlier. So, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Let me confirm that. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to terms with various powers of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times each coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, meaning the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion. But that doesn't make sense because coefficients are scalars, not polynomials. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, but that seems incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), so that the answer is 120. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would mean that the \\(c\\) terms can be anything, so the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe it's expecting the coefficient when \\(c\\) is set to a particular value, but that's not specified. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so that the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. That seems plausible. So, maybe the answer is 120. Let me check that again. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not specifying any particular power of \\(c\\), but in the original expression, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so perhaps the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem expects a numerical answer. Therefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the product of the binomial expansions. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the constant term (where \\(c^0\\)), which has a coefficient of 20.\n3. Multiply the two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think about whether the second part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), maybe the coefficients from the second part don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, actually, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, right? Because the other part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6? Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me break it down. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), would contribute terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, but in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the entire second part, when expanded, will have various terms, but since we're multiplying the entire second part by each term from the first part, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part? Wait, that doesn't sound right either. Wait, perhaps not. Let me clarify: when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply, the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, so actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the product. Wait, no, that's not quite accurate either. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), then when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be correct because the sum of all coefficients in the second part is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part), giving 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me make sure I'm thinking correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by the entire first part, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part, which would include all possible terms with \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But let me think again: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term in the second part will contribute a factor to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me try a different approach. Let me consider the entire expression as a product of two separate expansions. The first expansion is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Now, when you multiply this by the entire second expansion, you get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second expansion. But when considering just the coefficient, without the variables, it would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is obtained by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have a simpler case: \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, in this case, the first expansion is \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The second expansion is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, when you multiply, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the terms would be \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2(1/c)\\), \\(2ab c\\), \\(2ab(1/c)\\), \\(b^2c\\), \\(b^2(1/c)\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is not present because each term in the first expansion is only up to \\(b^2\\), and the second expansion doesn't have a term that would combine to make \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, so in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero. But according to the previous logic, the coefficient would be 1 (from \\(a^2\\) in the first expansion) times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), giving 2. But that's not correct because there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, that suggests that my previous reasoning is wrong. Therefore, I must have made a mistake. Let me try to understand where I went wrong.\n\nWait, in the first example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present. But according to my earlier reasoning, I would have taken the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is zero, and multiplied it by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 2, giving zero. So, that actually gives the correct result. Wait, but in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But in the first example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is zero, so 0 * 2 = 0, which is correct. So, perhaps my initial approach was correct. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient is indeed 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6, the same as in the first part, because the second part doesn't influence the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that can't be right because when you multiply two expressions, each term is multiplied by each term in the other expression, so the coefficients do get multiplied. Wait, but in the first example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, which matches 0 * 2 = 0. So, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, perhaps that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me consider another example to verify. Let's take \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because the highest power of \\(a\\) is 1 and similarly for \\(b\\). According to my method, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is zero, so 0 * 2 = 0, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). In the first part, \\((a + b)^3\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{3}{2} = 3\\). The sum of coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2\\), is \\((1 + 1)^2 = 4\\). So, according to my method, the coefficient would be 3 * 4 = 12. Let's check by expanding. \\((a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\\). \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). Now, multiplying these, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) would be from \\(3a^2b \\times 2\\) and \\(3ab^2 \\times 2\\), but wait, no, that's not quite right because \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from \\(3a^2b \\times 2\\) and \\(3ab^2 \\times 2\\), but actually, when you multiply \\(3a^2b\\) by 2, you get \\(6a^2b\\), which is not \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, so perhaps my method is wrong because in reality, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero in this case, which would contradict my method. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, let's see. Wait, in the product \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually require that in the first part, you have a term with \\(a^2b\\), and in the second part, you have a term with \\(b\\), but the second part doesn't have \\(b\\); it has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, actually, there is no \\(b\\) in the second part, so \\(a^2b^2\\) cannot be formed. Therefore, the coefficient should be zero. But according to my method, it would be 3 * 4 = 12, which is incorrect. So, that suggests that my method is wrong.\n\nWait, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the coefficients interact. Let me try to figure out where I went wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that when you multiply two expressions, the variables are independent, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) cannot be formed from the product unless there's a term in the second expression that can contribute to the \\(b^2\\) part, but in the second expression, there's only \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so \\(b\\) doesn't appear there. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be zero, not 12. So, my earlier method was incorrect because I assumed that the coefficients just multiply, but in reality, variables are independent, and unless the variables in the second expression can contribute to the term in question, the coefficient remains as it is. Wait, but in the first problem, the variables are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by the second expression, which includes \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), it doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the same as in the first part, which is 6, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so it doesn't change the coefficient. Wait, that makes more sense. So, in the first example I did, where the second part was \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) was zero because in the first part, it was zero. In the second example, where I had \\((a + b)^3 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because the first part's coefficient is 3, but the second part doesn't have \\(b\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) can't be formed. Wait, but that contradicts the initial thought. Wait, no, in the first problem, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part. Wait, but in the second example, that would give 3 * 4 = 12, but in reality, the coefficient is zero because \\(b\\) is not present in the second part. So, perhaps my initial approach was wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that when you multiply two expressions, the variables are independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. But in the second example, that would give 3 * 4 = 12, which is incorrect because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present. So, that suggests that my initial approach is wrong. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is that since the second expression doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the same as in the first part, which is 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient remains 6. But wait, that seems too simple. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should treat the two expressions as separate. Since \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) are multiplied together, and since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will come only from the first expression, and the second expression contributes a factor that's multiplied by it. But since the second expression is a separate part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expression. But when considering just the coefficient, without the variables, it's the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But in the second example, this approach gave an incorrect result, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, when I expand \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\). Now, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\), which can be any integer depending on \\(m\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) values. So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, that would be 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But in the second example, where the first part was \\((a + b)^3\\) and the second part was \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2\\), following this method, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{3}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{2} \\dbinom{2}{m}\\) = 3 * 4 = 12, but in reality, the coefficient is zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) can't be formed. So, that suggests that this approach is incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the mistake is in assuming that the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part. But in reality, when you have multiple variables, the terms must combine to give the exact variables you're looking for. So, in the original problem, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But in the second example, since \\(a^2b^2\\) requires \\(b^2\\), but the second part doesn't have \\(b\\), so the coefficient remains as in the first part, which is zero. Wait, but in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because the first part is \\((a + b)^3\\), which only goes up to \\(b^3\\). Wait, no, in \\((a + b)^3\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because the maximum power of \\(b\\) is 3, but \\(a^2b^2\\) would require \\(a^2b^2\\), which isn't present. So, in that case, the coefficient is zero, which matches the result from the product. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient is indeed 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the correct approach is to realize that since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, times the sum of coefficients from the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have two separate variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when you multiply it by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), ..., up to \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but in the second example, where the first part was \\((a + b)^3\\) and the second part was \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2\\), using this method, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 3 * 4 = 12, but in reality, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present because the first part only goes up to \\(a^3b^0\\) and \\(a^0b^3\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present. Therefore, the coefficient should be zero, which contradicts the method. Therefore, perhaps my method is wrong, and I need a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the variables are independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, in the original problem, the coefficient is 6, and in the second example, it's 3, but in reality, in the second example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because the first part doesn't have \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as in the first part, regardless of the second part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, in the original problem, it's 6, and in the second example, it's zero because the first part doesn't have \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because in the original problem, the second part is multiplied by the first part, so the coefficients should combine. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the concepts here.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because in the original problem, the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is just multiplied by each term in the second part, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But in the second example, since the first part doesn't have \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient remains zero, regardless of the second part. So, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part if the first part has that term. Otherwise, it's zero. So, in the original problem, it's 6 * 64 = 384, and in the second example, since the first part doesn't have \\(a^2b^2\\), it's zero.\n\nWait, but in the second example, the first part is \\((a + b)^3\\), which doesn't have \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is zero. Therefore, in the original problem, since the first part does have \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), since it doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the second example, the coefficient would be 3 * 4 = 12, but in reality, the coefficient is zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present. So, perhaps the mistake is in assuming that the coefficient from the first part is present when it's not. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part only if the first part has that term. Otherwise, it's zero. So, in the original problem, since the first part has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. In the second example, since the first part doesn't have \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient is zero, which matches the reality.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check one more time. Let me consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the second example, where the first part is \\((a + b)^3\\), which doesn't have \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be zero, which matches the reality. So, perhaps the initial confusion was due to the second example, but in the original problem, the coefficient is indeed 384.\n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, since the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a sum of coefficients equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\), the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

    "text": " I wonder if that affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), right? So, maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That is, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you multiply by any other term from the second expression, you'd get some power of \\(c\\) attached, which we don't want since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, and it's multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second expression. Therefore, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me check again. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression is multiplied by the constant term 20 in the second expression, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. I think that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire product as a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply when the variables don't interfere. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the product of the coefficients from each expansion where the other variables are at zero exponent. So, yeah, 6 times 20 is 120. I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), and the constant term from the other expression is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part, maybe the second part doesn't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Because when you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply term by term. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of the first will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second. But since the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first part, perhaps the second part just contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by the 6 I found earlier. Wait, but actually, the entire expression is the product of the two expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, and then you add up the products. So, for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), etc. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we need to find the term in the second expansion that is a constant, i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, to find that, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well.

We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the product of the coefficients from each expansion. So, from the first part, it's 6, and from the second part, it's 20. So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me check that again. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 as the constant term. So, when I multiply them, 6 * 20 = 120.

When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression.

But in this case, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first polynomial, and then any term from the second polynomial would just be a separate variable, so \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it. Wait, but that can't be right because the entire expression is the product of the two. So, when you multiply, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct either. Because each term in the product would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k \\times (1/c)^{6 - k}\\) for some \\(k\\). But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate term from the \\(c\\) terms, so maybe the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But wait, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the sum of all the coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then it's the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part (which is 64). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion's coefficients. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that includes all the terms from the second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Wait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term involving \\(c\\), but perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient when considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), regardless of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would involve considering all possible terms, but since \\(c\\) is separate, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both \\(a, b, c\\), so perhaps it's more involved. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, but since \\(c\\) is present, maybe the coefficient is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). Hmm, but that's more complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the part with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the \\(c\\) part is just a separate multiplier, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is the product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first polynomial (which is 6) multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating all variables as separate, but that would require that the \\(c\\) terms don't interfere, which they don't because they're separate variables. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Wait, but the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and its coefficient is 6. The rest of the expression is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients is found by plugging \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But let me check this again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. In that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when the exponents cancel out, which occurs when the number of \\(c\\) terms equals the number of \\(1/c\\) terms. So, in the expansion, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 384. But I'm a bit confused because the problem includes both \\(a, b, c\\), so maybe it's asking for the coefficient when considering all variables. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is simply 6, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression includes both parts. Wait, perhaps the problem is to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating, and the answer is 6. But I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The entire expression also includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), whose sum of coefficients is 64.

But wait, that seems like it's not quite right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives us \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times 64, which is 384? But that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all separate variables, the exponents on \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't depend on \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (since \\(c^0 = 1\\)) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so we need the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, maybe I should find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. Let me check that approach. So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that seems more reasonable. So, the coefficient is 120. Let me confirm this again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the sum of all coefficients from the second part that don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But wait, actually, no. Because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and I multiply it by any term from the second part, which could be \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents, then the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384, but that contradicts my earlier thought. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing two different approaches. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form \\((a^kb^{4 - k}) \\times (c^m c^{-n})\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the exponents on \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are determined by the first part, and the exponents on \\(c\\) are determined by the second part. So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents, we can consider that each term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. But earlier, I thought that the constant term in the second expansion is 20, leading to 6*20=120. Now I'm confused because I'm getting two different answers. Let me think again. Perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if we consider all terms, including those with \\(c\\) exponents, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 * (coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion). But the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\). So, does that mean we need to sum over all possible \\(c\\) exponents? That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\)'s exponent. In that case, it would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is raised to any power. So, in other words, the coefficient would be the sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is indeed 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. But that seems counterintuitive because the problem might just be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6*20=120. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think about it differently. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\). Then the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = (a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). In this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6*64=384. On the other hand, if I set \\(c = 1\\) in the original expression, I get the same result. But if I don't set \\(c = 1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. But earlier, I thought that maybe it's just 6*20=120 because we're only interested in the constant term. I'm confused. Let me try to think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). What is the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\)? In \\((a + b)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) is 2. In \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), the expansion is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the entire product is \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\). If I want the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 2*(1 + 1) = 4, because each term \\(a^1b^1\\) is multiplied by both \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient would be 2*2=4. But if I wanted the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1c^0\\), that would be 2*(1)=2, because only the constant term in the second expansion. So, in this simple example, depending on whether we're considering all \\(c\\) terms or just the constant term, the coefficient changes. Therefore, going back to the original problem, since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. But wait, in my simple example, when I set \\(c=1\\), I got the same result as multiplying by the sum of coefficients. So, perhaps the correct approach is to evaluate the entire expression at \\(c=1\\), which gives the sum of all coefficients, and then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6*64=384. Alternatively, if I don't set \\(c=1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. So, I think that's the right answer. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 120. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in my initial approach. Let me try another angle. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be formed by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part. Since the second part is multiplied as a whole, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6*20=120. But the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's 384. But I'm still not entirely sure. Let me check online or recall similar problems. Wait, I can't actually check online, but I remember that when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one variable is the product of the coefficient of that term in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. Therefore, the answer should be 384. But earlier, I thought it was 120, so I'm a bit conflicted. Let me try to think differently. Suppose I expand both parts separately and then multiply them. The first part has terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), \\(b^4\\). The second part has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). When I multiply these together, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) is the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6. Let me calculate that: 6 + 36 = 42; 42 + 90 = 132; 132 + 120 = 252; 252 + 90 = 342; 342 + 36 = 378; 378 + 6 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) is indeed 384. Therefore, I think my initial confusion was because I was considering whether to include all \\(c\\) terms or just the constant term, but the problem doesn't specify, so it's correct to include all. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the expansion of each part separately and then combining the results.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   The entire expansion contributes all possible powers of \\(c\\).

    "text": " Maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't affected by this part because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables. Wait, but actually, the entire expression is a product of two expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in terms of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by whatever the constant term is in the second expansion, because we don't want any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but actually, when you multiply two terms, one from each expansion, if one term has \\(a^2b^2\\) and the other has some power of \\(c\\), then the product will have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some \\(c\\) term. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean we need to consider all the terms where the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by any term from the second expansion? But that would include all powers of \\(c\\), which might be more complicated. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part will contribute to the overall coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that might make sense. Let me check. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\) and \\( \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m} \\). Now, when I multiply these two expansions, each term from the first will be multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\( \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 \\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term \\( \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m} \\) from the second expansion. So, the product will have terms like \\( \\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m} \\) for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That means we need to collect all the coefficients from each term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, and sum them up. So, the total coefficient would be \\( \\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} \\). Wait, but \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\), since the sum of binomial coefficients for a given \\(n\\) is \\(2^n\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\)? Hmm, but that seems too straightforward. Let me verify. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is a product of two polynomials, but only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part contributes a factor that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is indeed \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that \\(c\\) should be raised to zero power. But that would require the second expansion to have a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me clarify the problem statement: It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire expansion, we have terms like \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m\\) and so on. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed \\( \\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} \\), which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong, and the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. So, let's see. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression would be \\( \\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120 \\). Hmm, now I'm confused because I interpreted the problem in two different ways and got two different answers: 384 and 120. Which one is correct? Let me re-examine the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" The way it's phrased, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, in the context of polynomial expressions, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term with certain variables, it usually means that you should consider the term with those variables raised to the specified exponents, and any other variables can be present with any exponent. However, in this case, the expression is a product of two separate polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear multiplied by every possible term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems high. Alternatively, if the problem is interpreted as asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think the correct interpretation is that we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, it's 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of another way. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is a monomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a monomial in \\(c\\). When you multiply them, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by every term from the second polynomial, which are \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes its coefficient to the product. The sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64 \\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 120 if we were only considering the constant term in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think 384 is the right answer.\n\nWait, but let me check with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding this, I get \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). Now, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), so the coefficient is \\(1 \\times (1 + 1) = 2\\), because the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be the same. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is the same as the coefficient in the first polynomial times the sum of coefficients in the second. So, that seems to confirm that the approach is correct. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient should be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes problems like this might expect you to consider only the constant term in \\(c\\), but in this case, the problem didn't specify, so I think it's safer to go with the interpretation that we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\)'s exponent. So, 384 is the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in the product is of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), and it's multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) for each \\(m\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, that's \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Therefore, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to consider only the term where \\(c^0\\) is present, then the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the correct approach is to consider all possible exponents of \\(c\\), so the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It's possible that the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so perhaps 120 is the answer. But without more context, it's hard to say. However, given that the problem is presented in this way, I think the intended answer is 384, because when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, you consider all possible terms where that variable part is present, regardless of the other variables. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is the product of the coefficients, with the second part summed over all possible terms.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit uncertain. Let me think of another approach. Maybe I can treat the entire expression as a product and look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the two polynomials are in different variables, \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), the multiplication will result in terms where each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a Laurent polynomial, meaning it can have negative exponents. But when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\), we're effectively summing over all possible coefficients from the second polynomial. So, yes, it's 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified that we need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 120. But since it didn't, I think 384 is the right answer.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller exponent to see if this approach works. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^1 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). Expanding, we get \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is \\(1 \\times (1 + 1) = 2\\), but actually, the coefficient in terms of numerical coefficients is \\(1\\) times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, that's correct. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also 2. So, that approach works. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, yes, 384 is correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to write out the product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nNow, when we multiply these two, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6 \\times (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that confirms it.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

But wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term with only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the \\(c\\) terms must somehow cancel out. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we're looking for the terms where the \\(c\\) parts cancel out to 1, right? Because otherwise, the term would involve \\(c\\) and wouldn't just be \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in other words, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, that means the coefficient we're looking for is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. So, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That is, solve \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). So, \\(6 = 2m\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, so when we multiply these two, we get 120. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the term where \\(c^0\\) contributes to the coefficient without any \\(c\\) terms. So, yes, the total coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):** The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):** We seek the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:** \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " I'm not sure if that part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), so maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by whatever the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't matter. Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first expansion, because the second expansion doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in the first part are multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) in the second part. But since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the other terms (with \\(c\\)) would just be coefficients multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply out the entire expression, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the combined expression. But \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first factor, and when you multiply by the second factor, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) something with \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that seems like it's not a single coefficient. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to clarify: The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). So, when you expand the product, each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that it's treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable and just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the answer is just 6, because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the other terms are just multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to a sum of terms, each term would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct either because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term, the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) would vary based on the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms are products of terms from each polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But when you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's actually 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not a polynomial. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the question is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but no, it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times each term in that expansion, but that's not a single coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable and just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that makes more sense. Because if we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are 0, then we need to consider the term where in the second expansion, the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 is when we have an equal number of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which happens when we choose 3 \\(c\\)s and 3 \\(1/c\\)s. The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the answer is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when I considered the sum of all coefficients, which would be when \\(c = 1\\), but that's not the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. Let me confirm that. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second expansion with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply them, you get \\(6 * 20 * a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. That makes sense. So, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):** The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):** The term with \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, does that mean that the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or is there something I'm missing? Let me think. The entire expression is a product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with those involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me check. Suppose I have two expressions, \\(P(a, b) = \\sum p_i a^i b^j\\) and \\(Q(c) = \\sum q_k c^k\\). Then, the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) would be \\(\\sum p_i q_k a^i b^j c^k\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would be \\(p_{2,2} \\times Q(c)\\), because in the product, each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be \\(p_{2,2}\\) times the entire \\(Q(c)\\). But that seems off because \\(Q(c)\\) is a function of \\(c\\), but we're looking for a coefficient in the product, which would have terms with \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient would be \\(p_{2,2}\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), each term contributes to a different term in the product. But wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, and when you multiply it by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second part. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any other term in \\(Q(c)\\), you'd get a term with \\(c\\) involved, which would change the term to something like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-1}\\), etc. So, the only way to get a term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(Q(c)\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, I need to find two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found to be 6. 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on the second part. So, I need to find the constant term (the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is the term when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120. Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That's correct. Then, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is 0, which occurs at \\(k = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 is indeed 120. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n$\\boxed{120}$"
