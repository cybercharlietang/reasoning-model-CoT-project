    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should break this down into two parts. The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these are multiplied together, the overall expansion will involve multiplying terms from each expansion. But wait, I'm only asked about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, does that mean I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I?\n\nWait, no, I think I do need to consider both parts. Because even though the question is about \\(a^2b^2\\), the entire expression includes both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c, 1/c\\). So when I expand both parts, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will come from the first part, and the other part will contribute a term that's multiplied by it. So maybe I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the sum of all terms in the second part, because any term from the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and then multiply it by the entire second part, because every term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing to the overall coefficient. But wait, that doesn't sound quite right because the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables. So maybe the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient is just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second part. But wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term without \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by terms that have \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the resulting terms will have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So actually, maybe the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only affected by the constant term in the second part, if there is one. Wait, but \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) might have a constant term. Let me check that.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term will be of the form \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot (1/c)^k = \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So the exponents of \\(c\\) will be even numbers because \\(6 - 2k\\) is even for integer \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. So the exponents of \\(c\\) can be 6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6. So the constant term is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which happens when \\(k = 3\\). So the constant term is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). So that means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by 20. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term 20, you get \\(20a^2b^2\\), and all other terms from the second expansion will have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they won't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. So the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion can be found using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So for \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nThen, as I thought earlier, the second part has a constant term of 20, so the overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me check again to make sure I didn't overlook anything. So the expansion is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand each part separately, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the second part contributes 20 when it's the constant term. So when I multiply these together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expansion being the product of two expansions. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k \\times c^{-m}\\) would involve terms from both expansions, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms have to cancel out, i.e., \\(k - m = 0\\), which means \\(k = m\\). But since the second expansion only has specific exponents, the only way for \\(c\\) to be canceled is when both exponents are the same, so the constant term is the only one that contributes. So yeah, I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the constant term in the second expansion. So \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So when is the exponent zero? When \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So the term is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct.\n\nAnd in the first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\), which is correct.\n\nSo multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   We need the constant term in this expansion, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) gives \\(k = 3\\). The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part.\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nFirst off, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here for the \\((a + b)^4\\) part.\n\nLet me write that out for \\(n = 4\\). So, \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which means \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That makes sense because if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(4 - 2 = 2\\). So, the term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6 in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nNow, the original expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient. Wait, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is from the second part when it's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate term, so maybe the second part is being multiplied by the entire expansion of the first part. So, perhaps I need to consider the entire expression as a product of two expansions.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, that would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion. But that doesn't seem right because then the coefficient would be a very large number, and I think I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the rest of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is being multiplied by \\((a + b)^4\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that term separately from the rest.\n\nWait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when I multiply it by any term from the second expansion, it will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, no, wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me read it again.\n\nIt says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the entire expression is a product of two binomial expansions. So, when we expand this product, we'll have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m c^{-n}\\), but we're only looking for the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, i.e., \\(a^2b^2\\), and then the coefficient for that specific term.\n\nWait, but actually, no. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're looking at all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire sum of the second expansion. But that can't be, because the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when we set \\(c = 1\\), which would give \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, is the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384?\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering the entire expression and just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nBut let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you expand \\((a + b)^4\\), you get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), etc. Then, when you multiply each of these by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is a sum of terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would indeed be 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), like \\(c^0\\), then we would have to find the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, but since it's not specified, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me try another approach.\n\nThe entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can treat this as the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, as we found earlier. Then, the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with various powers of \\(c\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nThe sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, I think the answer is 384.\n\nBut just to double-check, let me compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem.\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}=1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}=6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}=15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}=20\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}=15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}=6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}=1\\). So, the sum of these coefficients is indeed 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that I'm overcounting? Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes to a different power of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) term. So, in the product, each term would be of the form \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is the sum over all \\(m\\) of 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we would have needed to find \\(m\\) such that \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Then, the coefficient would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) = 6 * 20 = 120. But since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem statement again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so I think it's correct that we sum over all the coefficients from the second expansion, resulting in 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but I think that's not the case because it's not specified. So, I think 384 is correct.\n\nWait, but let me try to compute it another way. Let's consider that when we multiply the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each expansion where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe are interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which is \\(a^2b^2\\). This corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), giving us:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient from this part is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nThe sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n\\[\n(1 + 1)^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nSince we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we multiply the coefficient from the first part by the sum of the coefficients from the second part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I know that when expanding expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\), we can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), I can expand it and find the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nLet me write out the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. I need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which means \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{2}b^{2}\\).\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) are variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\). That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of the constant term (i.e., the term without \\(c\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when we multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but only the constant term will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the final product without introducing any \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm thinking correctly. When we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the terms in the product where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2. However, since \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) are separate variables, the exponent on \\(c\\) doesn't affect the exponent on \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because then the coefficient would have terms involving \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nTo find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can again use the binomial theorem. The expansion will be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. When I multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nIs there any possibility I missed something? Let me think. Since the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all distinct, when multiplying the two polynomials, the only way to get an \\(a^2b^2\\) term is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the constant term from the second. There's no other combination of terms that would result in \\(a^2b^2\\) because any term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would add exponents to \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which aren't present in the original term we're seeking.

    "text": " \n\nFirst off, I know that when dealing with expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\), we can use the binomial theorem to expand them. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply this theorem to both parts of the given expression separately and then multiply them together.\n\nLet me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this should be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficients here are the binomial coefficients for \\(n = 4\\). Let me write them out:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\), term is \\(a^4\\)\n- \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\), term is \\(4a^3b\\)\n- \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), term is \\(6a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\), term is \\(4ab^3\\)\n- \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\), term is \\(b^4\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I can also expand this using the binomial theorem. Let's write that out:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\n\\]\n\nSimplifying each term, \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = c^{-m}\\), so each term becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, the expansion will have terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6.\n\nLet me write down the terms:\n\n- \\(m = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} c^{6} = 1 \\cdot c^6\\)\n- \\(m = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(m = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(m = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\cdot 1 = 20\\)\n- \\(m = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(m = 5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(m = 6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, the original problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of these two expansions. That is, we need to compute:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4) \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\n\\]\n\nBut we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, when we multiply these two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. However, since we're looking for the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find all the products where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts result in \\(a^2b^2\\), and then sum up the coefficients from those products.\n\nLooking at the first polynomial, the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, when we multiply this term by each term in the second polynomial, each of those products will have the \\(a^2b^2\\) part multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) (or with any power of \\(c\\)), wait, no, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a part of the product, and the other part is the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each of these will contribute to terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4\\), etc.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). However, in the product, each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the term, but the other part is the \\(c\\) term. So, to get a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), it must come from multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion. But each of these products will result in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, these are all terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we need to find the coefficient when the product results in a term that has exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) and no other variables, right? Wait, no, that's not correct because in the product, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all multiplied together. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire product, we're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that is, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) is considered, and we're to sum up the coefficients of all such terms. Wait, but that's not standard. Typically, when we're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, like \\(a^2b^2\\), in a product of polynomials, it's the coefficient when considering all variables. But in this case, since the expression also involves \\(c\\), which is another variable, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of a term that also includes some power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), meaning we need to sum all the coefficients where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient is the sum of all the coefficients from the products of \\(6a^2b^2\\) with each term in the second expansion. So, that would be \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of all coefficients in the second expansion). Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(6a^2b^2\\), the coefficient becomes \\(6 \\times\\) that coefficient, and the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) times the \\(c\\) term.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct. Let me think again. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which, when expanded, has terms with coefficients, each multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, each product will be \\(6 \\times\\) (coefficient) \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{\\text{some exponent}}\\). So, each of these products contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the sense that they are terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, but with different powers of \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be the sum of all coefficients from the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of all coefficients in the second expansion).\n\nBut wait, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of its coefficients is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me consider that in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and each term in the second expansion. So, each of these products contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be the sum of all coefficients from the products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present. So, that would be \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of coefficients in the second expansion), which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all variables, which would mean that we need to find the coefficient where the term is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify any restriction on \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is indeed the sum of all the coefficients from the products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) term. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product can only come from multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion. So, each of these products will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term in \\(c\\), so each of these will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the sense that they are part of the product. However, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from these products. So, that would be \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). As the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let's think about the product more carefully. The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which has terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). When we multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, each of these products will be:\n\n- \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4 = 36a^2b^2c^4\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^2 = 90a^2b^2c^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^{-2} = 90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^{-4} = 36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^{-6} = 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, each of these terms has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the coefficient of the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. Wait, no, that's not correct because \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of a term that also includes \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of a term that includes \\(c\\) raised to some power. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, we would sum all the coefficients from the products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) term.\n\nBut that would mean adding up all the coefficients from the seven terms I listed above. Let's calculate those coefficients:\n\n- 6 (from \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\))\n- 36 (from \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\))\n- 90 (from \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\))\n- 120 (from \\(120a^2b^2\\))\n- 90 (from \\(90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\))\n- 36 (from \\(36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\))\n- 6 (from \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\))\n\nAdding these up: 6 + 36 = 42; 42 + 90 = 132; 132 + 120 = 252; 252 + 90 = 342; 342 + 36 = 378; 378 + 6 = 384.\n\nSo, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) is 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the question correctly. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire product, each term will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) exponents. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of a term that also includes \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, that would be the sum I calculated, 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to look for that specific term. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), we have to consider all possible powers of \\(c\\) and sum their coefficients.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^i b^j c^k\\), where \\(i + j = 4\\) from the first expansion and \\(k\\) comes from the second expansion. But we're looking for terms where \\(i = 2\\) and \\(j = 2\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, each multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\nSo, indeed, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another approach. Let's consider that the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem to expand each part separately and then analyze the product.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\n\nNext, we expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nThe sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n\\[\n(1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, we multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion (which is 6) by the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion (which is 64):\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to \\(n\\). So, maybe I can apply this to both parts of the given expression separately and then multiply them together.\n\nLet me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of this would be the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient here would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, each term here is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait, but I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first part. But this second part is in terms of \\(c\\). Hmm, does that mean I need to consider how these two parts interact? Let me think.\n\nSince the expression is a product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I expand both, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the entire expression will have terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), I think it's just asking for the coefficient when considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Or maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, no, actually, the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, right?\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (the coefficient from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nBut wait, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because that would make each term equal to its coefficient. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64.\n\nSo, then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if that's the case, then we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, and then multiply that by the coefficient from the first part.\n\nWait, that makes more sense because otherwise, if we just multiply by all coefficients, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have multiple coefficients depending on the power of \\(c\\), but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), which would actually be the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. But I'm getting confused now.\n\nWait, let's clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k \\times c^{6 - 2m}\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), as I found earlier.\n\nNow, for the second part, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when I multiply the first part's term \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second part, I get \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, it's treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. Because when you expand the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a sum over all possible powers of \\(c\\), which isn't typically how such problems are phrased.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n\nSo, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20.\n\nNow, multiplying this by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was under the assumption that we're summing all coefficients from the second part, which would be the case if we were considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not specifying any power of \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that we're supposed to consider the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Otherwise, the coefficient would be a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms, which isn't standard.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too large, and usually, such problems ask for specific terms, so I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\). That means that in the entire product, every term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), contributes to the coefficient. So, the coefficient would be the sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by their respective coefficients from the second part.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems counterintuitive because the problem is written as a product, so perhaps it's intended to consider the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nBut the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\).\n\nBut wait, if that's the case, then the coefficient is 384. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then it's 120. I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so 384. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Let me try another approach. Suppose I consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, yes, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 times 20, which is 120. But since it's not specified, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me think about it differently. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this would be 6 times 64, which is 384. So, that seems to confirm it.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't mention \\(c\\) at all, so perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), with coefficients that are polynomials in \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure because usually, such problems ask for specific terms, including any variables. But since it's not specified, I think 384 is the answer.\n\nWait, but let me consider another perspective. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. That would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would need to find the term where \\(6 - 2m = k\\). But since it's not specified, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm going to check online to see if there's a similar problem. Wait, I can't do that right now, but I can think of an example. For instance, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), then expanding it would give \\(a^2c + a^2(1/c) + 2ab c + 2ab(1/c) + b^2c + b^2(1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is 2 when \\(c = 1\\), but in the general case, it's a polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed \\(c + 1/c\\). Therefore, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, multiplied by 6, giving 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120 when considering \\(c^0\\). So, which one is correct? I think it depends on how the problem is interpreted. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Since the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), I think it's 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is the sum of the products of that term's coefficient and all coefficients from the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, that's 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm going to check with specific numbers. Let me compute \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNext, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's compute this:\n\nThe expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- \\(m=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- \\(m=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(m=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(m=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(m=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(m=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(m=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients is \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\), as we found earlier.\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in:\n\n\\(6 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120. But since the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), I think the answer is 384.\n\nBut to make sure, let me think of it as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), where each term corresponds to the coefficient from the second part. So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is this entire expression, but if the problem is asking for the coefficient as a numerical value, then perhaps it's considering the constant term, which would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. However, in most cases, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, it's referring to the coefficient when considering all variables, meaning the coefficient is a product of the coefficients from each part. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, giving 384.\n\nBut to resolve this ambiguity, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would indeed be 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the sum over all \\(c\\) terms multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, I just realized that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of the terms that combine to form that term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 times 64, giving 384.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\), we can use the binomial theorem to expand them. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\). So maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLooking at the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), if I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. So let's figure out what \\(k\\) should be here.\n\nIf I have \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), and I want \\(a^2b^2\\), then \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That makes sense because \\(4 - 2 = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\) gives us \\(b^2\\). So the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, looking at the second part of the expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that this part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when I multiply the two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) because they won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Instead, I just need to consider the constant term from the second expansion because that's the only term that won't change the \\(a^2b^2\\) part when multiplied.\n\nWait, no, actually, I think I'm making a mistake here. Because when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is 6, and then it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the question is about a coefficient, not an expression.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So actually, the expression is a product of two separate expansions. So when I multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a part of the product, and the rest of the expression is multiplied by it. Wait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering both parts. But actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So when we expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we're looking for the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it would create terms involving \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it would create terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, meaning that we need to consider the product as a whole and find the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a single coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the question is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", implying a numerical coefficient. So perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term, and the rest is multiplied by it, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), whose sum of coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, no, that approach is wrong because the problem isn't asking for the sum of coefficients, but rather the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 * (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)), which is 6 * (2^6) = 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). So when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, we get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. So that would be the term where the second part contributes a constant term, which is 20. So the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and in the second part, the constant term is 20, so when multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nLet me verify that. So first, expand \\((a + b)^4\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

That is, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think I might be misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it must be considering the entire product as a single expression, and the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by all the terms from the second part. \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), and the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, actually, when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, but what about \\(c\\)? \n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again: it says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, we're looking for the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because we're just looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), not multiplied by any \\(c\\) terms. \n\nSo, that means I need to find the term in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. Therefore, the coefficient will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can again use the binomial theorem. Let's write out the expansion:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the two expansions are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part).\n\nSo, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFirst part: \\((a + b)^4\\), term \\(a^2b^2\\) has coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That seems right.\n\nSecond part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), looking for the term where exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, \\(c^{6 - 2k} = c^0\\), so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That also seems correct.\n\nMultiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the final answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 a^2 b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nMultiplying the coefficients from each part, we get:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression raised to a power like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nThe first part of the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. So, for \\(n = 4\\), each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4.\n\nI'm specifically looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is also squared. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2. \n\nLet me think about the exponents. If \\(a\\) is raised to the power of \\(4 - k\\) and \\(b\\) is raised to the power of \\(k\\), then for both exponents to be 2, I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Solving that, \\(4 - k = 2\\) gives \\(k = 2\\). So, the term I'm interested in is when \\(k = 2\\).\n\nNow, let's compute the coefficient for that term. The binomial coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I know that \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nOkay, so that's the first part. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if I need to consider the \\(c\\) terms when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, maybe the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients? Let me think.\n\nWait, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, the product will have terms where each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears when multiplying by the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, the only way it can be multiplied by a term from the second expression is if that term is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)).\n\nSo, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by this constant term, it will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.\n\nLet me verify that. If I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by, say, \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\), those would give me terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), those terms wouldn't contribute because they have extra \\(c\\) factors. So, the only term that contributes is the constant term, where \\(k = 0\\). That makes sense.\n\nSo, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).\n\nSimplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) and solve for \\(m\\). \n\n\\(6 - 2m = 0\\)  \n\\(2m = 6\\)  \n\\(m = 3\\).\n\nSo, the constant term occurs when \\(m = 3\\). Let's compute the coefficient for that term. The binomial coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. \n\nThat is, \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion. But since only the constant term contributes, it's just 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nI don't think I missed anything here. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\nWe are interested in the term where the exponents of both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2. This occurs when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens when:\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\nThe coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression raised to a power like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply this to both parts of the given expression.\n\nLet me start with the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this should expand to:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\nSimplifying the coefficients, that becomes:\n\\[\n1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. Got that down.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I can also expand this using the binomial theorem. Let me write that out:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\n\\]\nSimplifying the exponents, since \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = c^{-k}\\), the expression becomes:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Hmm, I need to figure out which term in this expansion will multiply with the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part to give me a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, actually, no\u2014the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. But the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c. \n\nWait, but hold on, is that correct? Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(k\\) is from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) is from 0 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\) in the first expansion, which we already found has a coefficient of 6. Now, when we multiply this by the second expansion, each term in the second expansion will multiply this 6. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, I think we just need to consider the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. Because when you multiply 6 by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a different power of c, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients for each term combine. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by 6, will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms. But actually, no, that's not correct because the second expansion has terms with different powers of c, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is in terms of c, so when you multiply by the first part, which is in terms of a and b, you're just getting terms that are products of a, b, and c terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of c. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that's not right because each term in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion is when we set c = 1, so the sum is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Because if I set c = 1 in the second expansion, I get the sum of all its coefficients, which is 64. Then, multiplying by 6, the coefficient from the first expansion, gives 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. \n\nBut wait, let me think again. Is that correct? Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms. So, in other words, in the product, each term will have a certain power of c, but we're just interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), irrespective of what power of c is attached. So, that would mean that the coefficient is indeed 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of c. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible c terms is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all the terms in the other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and when you multiply it by the entire second polynomial, which has 64 as the sum of its coefficients, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all c terms is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have (a + b)^1 * (c + 1/c)^1. Then, expanding, it's (a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c. The coefficient of a in the first part is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2, so the coefficient of a in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. But looking at the expansion, the coefficient of a is 2, which matches. Similarly, the coefficient of b would be 2 as well. So, in this case, it works.\n\nAnother example: (a + b)^2 * (c + 1/c)^2. Expanding, (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2). The coefficient of ab in the first part is 2. The sum of coefficients in the second part is (1 + 1)^2 = 4. So, the coefficient of ab in the product would be 2 * 4 = 8. Let's check: when you multiply, the ab term from the first part will multiply each term in the second part, so 2ab * c^2 + 2ab * 2 + 2ab * 1/c^2. So, the coefficients for ab would be 2c^2 + 4 + 2/c^2. But the coefficient of ab, regardless of c, is 2 multiplied by each coefficient in the second expansion. Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of ab in the product is 2 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but when considering the entire product, the coefficient of ab is 2 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but in the product, each term is a combination, so the coefficient of ab is 2 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But in reality, when you multiply, the coefficient of ab is 2 times (1 + 2 + 1) = 8, which matches. So, yes, it seems that the coefficient of a specific term in the first polynomial is multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial to get the coefficient of that term in the product.\n\nTherefore, applying this to our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64, so the coefficient in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not confusing anything here. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of its coefficients is when we set c = 1, so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to think about it differently, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part, but since the second part is a polynomial in c, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the specific term, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. But in this case, since the second polynomial is in c, and the first is in a and b, the variables are separate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the specific c terms, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me try to think about it in terms of variables. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the product is a term from the first expansion times a term from the second expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the term where we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and any term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by each coefficient from the second part, and then summed together. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but another way to see it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient in the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But when you're just looking for the coefficient, not the specific term, you can consider that each term in the second polynomial contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by 6. So, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me check with a small example again to be sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The first part is a + b, so the coefficient of ab is 1 (but actually, it's a or b, not ab). Wait, maybe that's not the best example. Let's take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The first expansion is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), so the coefficient of ab is 2. The second expansion is \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\), sum of coefficients is 1 + 2 + 1 = 4. So, the coefficient of ab in the product should be 2 * 4 = 8. Let's see: when you multiply, you get \\(a^2c^2 + a^2*2 + a^2*(1/c^2) + 2ab*c^2 + 2ab*2 + 2ab*(1/c^2) + b^2c^2 + b^2*2 + b^2*(1/c^2)\\). The terms with ab are 2ab*c^2, 4ab, and 2ab*(1/c^2). So, the coefficient of ab is 2c^2 + 4 + 2/c^2. If we consider the coefficient regardless of c, it's 4 (the constant term) plus 2c^2 and 2/c^2. Wait, but in this case, the coefficient of ab is 4, but according to my earlier logic, it should be 2 * 4 = 8. Hmm, that contradicts. So, maybe my earlier reasoning was wrong.\n\nWait, no, in this example, the coefficient of ab is 4, not 8. So, that suggests that my earlier logic is incorrect. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, in this example, the coefficient of ab in the product is 4, but according to my earlier reasoning, it should be 2 * 4 = 8. So, that's a problem. So, my initial approach was wrong.\n\nWait, so let me think again. In the example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of ab in the product is 4, not 8. So, my earlier approach was incorrect.\n\nSo, what's the correct way? Let me see. The term ab in the product comes from multiplying ab from the first expansion by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient is 2 (from ab) multiplied by each coefficient in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of ab is 2*(1) + 2*(2) + 2*(1) = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8. But in reality, when I expanded it, I saw that the coefficient of ab is 4. So, that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, no, when I expanded it, I saw that the coefficient of ab is 4, but according to the multiplication, it should be 8. So, I must have made a mistake in the expansion.\n\nWait, let me re-expand \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\).\n\nSecond, \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2*(c)*(1/c) + (1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\).\n\nNow, multiplying these together:\n\n\\(a^2 \\times c^2 = a^2c^2\\)\n\n\\(a^2 \\times 2 = 2a^2\\)\n\n\\(a^2 \\times 1/c^2 = a^2/c^2\\)\n\n\\(2ab \\times c^2 = 2ab c^2\\)\n\n\\(2ab \\times 2 = 4ab\\)\n\n\\(2ab \\times 1/c^2 = 2ab/c^2\\)\n\n\\(b^2 \\times c^2 = b^2c^2\\)\n\n\\(b^2 \\times 2 = 2b^2\\)\n\n\\(b^2 \\times 1/c^2 = b^2/c^2\\)\n\nSo, the terms involving ab are \\(2ab c^2\\), \\(4ab\\), and \\(2ab/c^2\\). So, the coefficient of ab is 4, but the coefficients for ab with c^2 and 1/c^2 are 2 each. So, the total coefficient of ab in the product is 4, but according to the earlier logic, it should be 2*(sum of coefficients in second expansion) = 2*(4) = 8. But that's not matching.\n\nWait, so where is the mistake? It seems that the coefficient of ab is 4, not 8. So, my initial approach was wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the concept. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 4, but when I multiply by the coefficient of ab, which is 2, I get 8. But in reality, the coefficient of ab is 4. So, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of ab in the product is the coefficient of ab in the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part, but that's not matching.\n\nWait, no, in this example, the coefficient of ab in the product is 4, which is equal to 2 (from the first part) times 2 (the coefficient of the constant term in the second part). Wait, that doesn't make sense either.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part, but since the second part is a polynomial in c, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But when you're considering the coefficient regardless of c, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. But in the small example, this approach didn't work because the coefficient of ab was 4, not 2*4=8.\n\nWait, so maybe the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. Because only the term where the power of c is zero will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c terms. But in the problem, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms. Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes all possible c terms. So, in the small example, the coefficient of ab in the product is 4, which comes from 2ab multiplied by 2 (the constant term in the second expansion). So, the coefficient of ab is 2 * 2 = 4. Similarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. Because only the term where the power of c is zero will give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no c terms. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, so actually, it's the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion multiplied by 6. But in the small example, that approach didn't work because the coefficient of ab was 4, not 8.\n\nWait, but in the small example, the coefficient of ab is 4, which is 2 (from the first part) multiplied by 2 (the coefficient of c^0 in the second part). So, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. Because only the term where c^0 is present will multiply to give \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c terms. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, so maybe it's the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion multiplied by 6. But in the small example, that approach didn't work.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.\n\nThe problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the product will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\) for various k and m. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when k = 2 in the first expansion, which has a coefficient of 6. Now, in the second expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when we multiply 6 by each term in the second expansion, we get terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all m of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because each term contributes \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all c terms is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\).\n\nBut \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but in the small example, this approach didn't work because when I set k=1 (for ab) and m varies, the coefficient of ab was 4, which is 2 (from the first part) times 2 (the sum of coefficients in the second part where c^0 is present). Wait, no, in the small example, the second expansion was \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). So, the coefficient of c^0 is 2. Therefore, the coefficient of ab in the product is 2 * 2 = 4, which matches the expansion. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^kb^{n - k}\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the coefficient of c^0 in the second part.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of c^0 in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), because when m=3, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). So, the coefficient of c^0 is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 384. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, let's go back to the small example. The coefficient of ab in the product was 4, which is 2 (from the first part) multiplied by 2 (the coefficient of c^0 in the second part). So, in that case, the coefficient of the specific term (ab) is the product of the coefficients from each part where the c terms are zero. So, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of c^0 in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But in the small example, that approach didn't work because the coefficient was 4, not 8.\n\nWait, so perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Because only the term where c^0 is present will give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c terms. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, so perhaps it's the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion multiplied by 6, which would give 384. But in the small example, that approach didn't work.\n\nWait, but in the small example, the coefficient of ab in the product was 4, which is 2 * 2, where 2 is the coefficient of c^0 in the second expansion. So, that suggests that the correct approach is to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the coefficient of c^0 in the second part.\n\nBut then, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible c terms. So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\), where m ranges from 0 to 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all m of the coefficients from each term. So, that would be 6 multiplied by each \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), summed over m from 0 to 6. But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut in the small example, when I did that, I got the wrong result. So, what's the difference? Oh, wait, in the small example, the term we were looking for was ab, which comes from k=1 in the first expansion, which has a coefficient of 2. The second expansion is \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\), so the sum of coefficients is 4. So, according to this approach, the coefficient of ab would be 2 * 4 = 8, but in reality, it's 4. So, that suggests that this approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, but in reality, when you multiply ab by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like ab*c^2, ab*2, and ab*1/c^2. So, the coefficient of ab is 2 (from the first part) multiplied by each coefficient in the second part, which are 1, 2, and 1. So, the total coefficient for ab is 2*1 + 2*2 + 2*1 = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8. But when I expanded it earlier, I saw that the coefficient of ab was 4. So, that suggests that my expansion was wrong.\n\nWait, no, let me check again. When I expanded \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), I got:\n\n\\(a^2c^2 + 2a^2 + a^2/c^2 + 2abc^2 + 4ab + 2ab/c^2 + b^2c^2 + 2b^2 + b^2/c^2\\).\n\nLooking at the ab terms: 2abc^2, 4ab, and 2ab/c^2. So, the coefficients are 2c^2, 4, and 2/c^2. So, the coefficient of ab is 4, and the coefficients of ab with c^2 and 1/c^2 are 2 each. So, the total coefficient of ab is 4, but according to the multiplication, it's 2*(1 + 2 + 1) = 8. So, that's a contradiction. Therefore, my initial approach must be wrong.\n\nWait, I think the confusion arises because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by each term in the other polynomial, but when considering the coefficient regardless of the other variables, you have to sum over all possible combinations. But in this case, since the variables are separate (a, b in one; c in the other), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of c. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all c terms is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut in the small example, this approach didn't work because the coefficient of ab was 4, not 8. So, perhaps the difference is that in the small example, the term ab is of degree 2 in a and b, and when multiplied by the second expansion, which has terms of degree 2 in c, the total degree is 4 in c, but in the original problem, the variables are separate, so the coefficients add up differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is that when you have two separate variables, the coefficient of a specific combination of a and b is the product of their coefficients times the entire second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the entire second polynomial, but when considering the coefficient regardless of c, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut in the small example, the coefficient of ab was 4, which is 2 * 2, where 2 is the coefficient of c^0 in the second expansion. So, in that case, the coefficient of ab is 2 multiplied by the coefficient of c^0 in the second expansion. So, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the coefficient of c^0 in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nWait, but in the small example, the coefficient of ab was 4, which is 2 * 2, where 2 is the coefficient of c^0 in the second expansion. So, in that case, it worked. So, perhaps the correct approach is to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the coefficient of c^0 in the second part.\n\nBut then, in the original problem, the coefficient of c^0 in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384 because I considered the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But in the small example, that approach didn't work because it gave the wrong result. So, perhaps the correct approach is to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the coefficient of c^0 in the second part.\n\nWait, but let me think about it differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has different powers of c. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by each coefficient in the second expansion, and since the problem is asking for the coefficient regardless of c, it's the sum of all those contributions, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut in the small example, that approach didn't work because it gave 8 instead of 4. So, perhaps the confusion is that in the small example, the term ab is not being considered with all possible c terms, but rather, the coefficient of ab regardless of c is 4, which is 2 * 2, where 2 is the coefficient of c^0 in the second expansion.\n\nWait, I think the key here is understanding whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c or not. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, then it's the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion multiplied by 6, giving 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific k, then it's 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion.\n\nBut the problem is stated as: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\"\n\nSo, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c. So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut in the small example, when I did that, it didn't work because the coefficient of ab was 4, not 8. So, perhaps the small example is different because in that case, the term ab is of degree 2 in a and b, and when multiplied by the second expansion, which has degree 2 in c, the total degree is 4 in c, but the problem is asking for the coefficient regardless of c. So, in that case, the coefficient of ab is 4, which is 2 (from the first part) multiplied by 2 (the coefficient of c^0 in the second part). So, in that case, the correct approach is to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the coefficient of c^0 in the second part.\n\nBut in the original problem, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c, so it's the sum over all c terms, which would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the small example, the problem would be asking for the coefficient of ab, regardless of c, which is 4, which is 2 * 2. So, in that case, the approach is to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the coefficient of c^0 in the second part.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach depends on whether the term in question includes the variables from both polynomials or not. In the original problem, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve c, so when you multiply by the second expansion, each term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term in c. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion,"

    "text": " \n\nFirst off, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nThe given expression is a product of two binomial expressions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but the second part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe not directly because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So perhaps I can handle each part separately and then multiply the results.\n\nLet me break it down. First, I'll find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Then, I'll find the coefficient of the constant term (since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are involved, and I don't want any \\(c\\) terms in the final coefficient) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). After that, I'll multiply these two coefficients together to get the final answer. \n\nStarting with \\((a + b)^4\\), using the binomial theorem, the expansion will have terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). I'm interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would happen when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need the coefficient of the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), because in the original problem, we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. So, I need to find the constant term in this expansion.\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nI need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero for the term to be constant. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (which comes from the first part) multiplied by the constant term (which comes from the second part) will give me the desired coefficient.\n\nSo, multiplying the two coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that. Did I handle the exponents correctly? In the first part, the coefficient is 6, and in the second part, the constant term is 20. So, when I multiply these, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will multiply the constant term from the second part, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nIs there a possibility I made a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients? Let me verify:\n\nFor \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), yes, that's 6. And for \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's 20. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. \n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem on each part separately.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\).

We need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nSetting the exponent to zero:\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\nThe constant term is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3}\n\\]\nCalculating the binomial coefficient:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nMultiplying the coefficients from both parts gives:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression raised to a power like \\((a + b)^4\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\).

The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), contributes other variables. So, when we multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we're looking for the coefficient of the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) times whatever comes from the second part. But since the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, they won't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).

Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second part has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right either. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the expansion of the second part is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, we get terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), setting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). \n\nTherefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) just the product of the coefficients from each part? Because when you multiply two terms, their coefficients multiply. So, yes, if the first part contributes 6 to \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part contributes 64 in total, then the product will have \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. But wait, actually, each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms is indeed 6 times 64.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), its \"contribution\" is just its entire expansion, so the coefficient is 6 times 64.\n\nWait, but actually, no, that's not quite accurate. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6 from the first part, and when you multiply it by the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), each term in that expansion will have its own coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) (for any \\(k\\)) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in effect, it's asking for the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), which is the same as 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nSince the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64, as I found earlier, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this another way. Suppose I expand both parts separately and then multiply. The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c} + 15c^4 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 20c^3 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^3} + 15c^2 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^4} + 6c \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^5} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). Simplifying that, it's \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply the first part by the second part, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part, which is 6a^2b^2, is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each power of \\(c\\) will be 6 times the coefficient of that power of \\(c\\) in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) term, it's the sum of all those coefficients. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6*1 = 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6*6 = 36, \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 6*15 = 90, \\(a^2b^2\\) (constant term) is 6*20 = 120, \\(a^2b^2/c^2\\) is 6*15 = 90, \\(a^2b^2/c^4\\) is 6*6 = 36, and \\(a^2b^2/c^6\\) is 6*1 = 6.\n\nIf I add all these up: 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6. Let's calculate that step by step:\n\n6 + 36 = 42\n\n42 + 90 = 132\n\n132 + 120 = 252\n\n252 + 90 = 342\n\n342 + 36 = 378\n\n378 + 6 = 384.\n\nSo, that confirms it. The total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term in the second expansion is 6 times the corresponding coefficient in the second expansion. Summing all those gives 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the binomial expansions. Let me check the coefficients again.\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nFor \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). That's correct.\n\nSo, 6 * 64 = 384. Yep, that seems right.\n\nI think I've got it. The coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 a^2 b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient from this part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of the coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should break this down into two parts because it's a product of two binomial expressions. So, maybe I can handle each part separately and then combine them. Let me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nI remember that when expanding a binomial like \\((a + b)^n\\), we can use the binomial theorem, which states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, in this case, \\(n = 4\\), so the expansion will have terms from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(k = 4\\).\n\nI need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me see, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), right? Because \\(n - k = 4 - 2 = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Okay, that part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, this looks a bit trickier because it involves \\(c\\) and its reciprocal. But I think I can use the same binomial theorem here as well.\n\nSo, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nI need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but wait, this part only involves \\(c\\). So, maybe I don't need to worry about this part directly for \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, perhaps I need to consider the entire expression as a product and see how the terms combine.\n\nWait, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will multiply each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, maybe the \\(c\\) terms will just tag along as coefficients. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only part of the first expansion.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider it as the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all terms in the second part, but that seems off because the second part has terms with \\(c\\), so unless we're considering \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some \\(c\\) terms, but the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), not any specific term involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, you'll have terms like \\((\\text{something with } a \\text{ and } b) \\times (\\text{something with } c)\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the entire product, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that might be it. Because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part.\n\nBut let me verify that. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = K + \\text{other terms}\\), where K is the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Then, when I multiply, the term \\(6a^2b^2 \\times K\\) would be part of the product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6K\\).\n\nBut wait, that doesn't sound right because the second expansion isn't just a constant; it's a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so every term in the first polynomial that is \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, which includes all the \\(c\\) terms. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part, maybe it's correct to just multiply the coefficient from the first part by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all terms in the second part, which is the same as the sum of the coefficients, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let's say I have \\((a + b)^4 = A_0 + A_1a + A_2a^2 + A_3a^3 + A_4a^4\\) plus similar terms with \\(b\\). Similarly, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = B_0 + B_1c + B_2c^2 + \\dots + B_6c^6\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(A_2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire \\(B\\) series. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, it's \\(A_2 \\times B_0 + A_2 \\times B_1c + A_2 \\times B_2c^2 + \\dots\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(A_2 \\times (B_0 + B_1 + B_2 + \\dots + B_6)\\), which is \\(A_2 \\times 64\\), as I thought before.\n\nBut let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product would be \\(c + 1/c\\), so if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's \\(c + 1/c\\). But if I'm only interested in the numerical coefficient, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 1 (from \\(a\\)) times (1 + 1) = 2, but that's not correct because the actual coefficient is \\(c + 1/c\\), which isn't a number. So, perhaps in this problem, they are treating the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and they are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be the product of the coefficients from each part, which would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product, and when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the variable part, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those terms becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so perhaps it's the sum over all \\(k\\) of the coefficients of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. But since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, then the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a different approach. Let me compute the entire product and see what the coefficient is.\n\nFirst, compute \\((a + b)^4\\). As I did before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. So, \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\).\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me compute the sum of all coefficients in this expansion. To find the sum of coefficients, set \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64.\n\nTherefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because in reality, each term in the first expansion is being multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times each term in the second part, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But actually, that's not quite right because the second expansion isn't a single term, it's a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second expansion, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the variable part, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about a simpler case to verify. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(b\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, if I were to find the coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product, it's \\(c + 1/c\\). But if I were to find the coefficient of \\(a\\) ignoring \\(c\\), it would be 1 (from \\(a\\)) times (1 + 1) = 2. But in reality, it's \\(c + 1/c\\), which is more than just a number. So, perhaps in this problem, the answer is 384 because it's treating the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 * 64.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. But in the problem statement, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's correct to consider the coefficient as 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let me compute the entire product step by step.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's compute this expansion.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- \\(m = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} c^6 = 1 \\cdot c^6\\)\n- \\(m = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(m = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(m = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(m = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(m = 5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(m = 6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion above. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in:\n\n- \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot 6c^4 = 36a^2b^2c^4\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot 15c^2 = 90a^2b^2c^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot 20 = 120a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot 15c^{-2} = 90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot 6c^{-4} = 36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-6} = 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, all these terms will be present in the product. Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Looking at the terms above, the only term that has exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier conclusion of 384. So, I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me see where I went wrong.\n\nI think I misunderstood the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes all terms. But in reality, when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the only term that has exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is when the second part is the constant term, which is 20. So, the coefficient is 6 (from the first part) times 20 (the constant term in the second part), which is 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120, not 384. I think I confused myself earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients, but in reality, only the constant term in the second expansion will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) terms. All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they wouldn't contribute to the pure \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nSo, to clarify, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is the middle term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense now. So, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nLet me verify this again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2. When multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the only term that will result in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is when it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I made a mistake earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients, but actually, only the constant term contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) involved.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The expansion includes terms with various powers of \\(c\\).

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you expand a binomial like \\((a + b)^n\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\), right? \n\nI'm specifically looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, in the binomial expansion, \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). \n\nLet me calculate the binomial coefficient for that term. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the original expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that this part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might not need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but actually, the entire expression is a product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. \n\nHowever, since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat the two parts separately. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, let me think again. When you multiply two terms, one from each expansion, the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will add up. But since I'm looking for the term that only has \\(a^2b^2\\), the part from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) must contribute a term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, meaning \\(c^0\\). \n\nSo, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. \n\nIn the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nI need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), I get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nSince these two parts are multiplied together, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the key idea is that when you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), we're looking for the term in the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\) either, which is \\(c^0\\), and then multiply their coefficients. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think my reasoning is correct. The coefficient is 120. \n\nI don't think I made any calculation errors. Let me just double-check the binomial coefficients:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), which is correct.\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is also correct.\n\nMultiplying them gives 120, so I'm confident that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients. \n\n1. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3.

That means I need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let's set up the equation for the exponents: \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which implies \\(k = 2\\).

Let me use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).

So, maybe I can apply that here for both parts of the expression.\n\nLet me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term in this expansion will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4.

I don't think this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't interfere with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), right?\n\nWait, but let me think again. The entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the terms from the second expansion involving \\(c\\) will just multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by constants, but those constants don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all possible ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be formed when multiplying the two expansions. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from the second expansion that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would have to be multiplied by a term that cancels out the \\(c\\) part, but that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by the constant term from the second expansion.\n\nWait, so the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). So, the constant term in this expansion is 20, because when \\(k = 3\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{6 - 3} \\times (1/c)^3 = \\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when you multiply these two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term gets multiplied by 20, so the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nHmm, that seems right. Let me just verify each step again to be sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, binomial expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\): correct, and the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).\n\nThen, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): correct, and the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when we choose three \\(c\\) terms and three \\(1/c\\) terms, so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct.\n\nTherefore, when we multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is exactly what I did. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem.

But wait, actually, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the \\(c\\) terms might not affect this part. Hmm, maybe I should just focus on the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and see what the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is there.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because the second part is a separate expansion, but since we're only looking for terms with \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the second part's expansion doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term at all. So perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). But I'm not sure, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So when we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find the terms in the product where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right either because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those would contribute to different terms in the product. But since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe we just need the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that might not be correct. Maybe it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, for the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can expand this using the binomial theorem as well: \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So each term here is \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider the product of the coefficients from each expansion where the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but is that correct? Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), so when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, we get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is some exponent. But since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), adds a coefficient to \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but we are only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have coefficients multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients from each expansion. Hmm, I'm getting more confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, say \\(C_m\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(C_m a^2b^2 c^{k}\\), where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients \\(C_m\\) because each term contributes \\(C_m a^2b^2 c^{k}\\), so the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all \\(C_m\\) multiplied by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, no, maybe that's not correct. Because when you expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), so the coefficients are \\(\\binom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). The sum of these coefficients is indeed \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So if I multiply the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, by 64, I get 384. But I'm not sure if this is the correct approach because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). But in the product, each term would be \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\) for some \\(k\\) and \\(m\\). So if we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), that corresponds to \\(k=2\\), so the term is \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) for various \\(m\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible exponents of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely confident about this.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let me consider that in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. So the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me verify. Let's compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If we set \\(c = 1\\), then the expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all coefficients. So the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. So I think that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another thought: maybe I'm supposed to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, and each term in the product is \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\), so the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k=2\\), which gives \\(a^2b^2\\) and then multiplied by any term from the second expansion, which doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. So the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So I think the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me go through it step by step again.\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem: the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has coefficient \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: each term is \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\n3. When multiplying \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\n4. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times \\binom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\n5. Since the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), we sum all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and multiply by 6.\n\n6. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).\n\n7. Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nI think that makes sense. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nThe problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term in the expansion where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. Let me think: in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), what is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)?\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). So, when \\(k = 2\\), the term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2} b^{2}\\). Calculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nWait, but the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression. Hmm, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, is that right? Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of two binomial expansions. So, when I expand both, I'll have terms from each expansion multiplied together. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms won't interact with the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression should just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the terms multiply if the variables are separate. \n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But in this case, since the variables are different (the first has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the second has \\(c\\)), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will be the same as in the first polynomial, because the second polynomial contributes a constant factor when considering only the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me clarify. Let's denote the first part as \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply them, you get \\(P \\times Q\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(Q\\), it will be multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term with variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(Q\\) has terms with \\(c\\), the resulting product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product \\(P \\times Q\\), the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the term from \\(Q\\) is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. \n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\), which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient of the constant term in \\(Q\\), because that's the only term in \\(Q\\) that won't introduce \\(c\\) terms. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times \\text{(coefficient of the constant term in } Q)\\). \n\nNow, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k - k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1 = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of the constant term in \\(Q\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as the product of two polynomials, and when you multiply them, the coefficients multiply for terms that don't interfere with each other's variables. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only contribution to its coefficient comes from the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. \n\nSo, yes, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression as \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, let me apply the binomial theorem here. The exponent is 4, so \\(n = 4\\). I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which means \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. So, in terms of the binomial theorem, that would be when \\(n - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), because \\(a^{n - k}b^{k} = a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, let me check that.

Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so does this mean that the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\)? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, actually, the entire expression is the product of two expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or do they?\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two terms, one from each expansion, the variables from each will combine. So, for example, a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which could involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would only come from the term where the second part contributes a constant, right? Because if the second part contributes a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the entire term would have \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1/c\\), which are different terms, not just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a different power of \\(c\\), but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself will only be present if the second expansion contributes a constant term, i.e., a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by, say, \\(c^3\\), that would be \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), which is a different term. But if the second expansion has a term with \\(c^0\\), which is 1, then \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1 = a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.\n\nWait, so I need to compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives me 20 for the constant term \\(c^0\\). So, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by 20 from the second expansion, resulting in a total coefficient of 120 for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nIs there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. Suppose I have a term from the first expansion that's \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) and a term from the second expansion that's \\(c^{something}\\). For the product to have \\(a^2b^2\\), the first term must be exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(k = 2\\), because \\(a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\) would be \\(a^2b^2\\) when \\(k = 2\\). So, only that term contributes, and the second expansion must contribute a constant term to not affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Could there be another combination where, for example, a term with \\(a^3b\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by a term from the second expansion that somehow results in \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, no, because \\(a^3b \\times c^?\\) would still have \\(a^3b\\), and even if \\(c^?\\) is 1, it would just be \\(a^3b\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that can't happen. Similarly, any other term from the first expansion wouldn't combine to give \\(a^2b^2\\) unless it's exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) itself.\n\nTherefore, I think my calculation is correct. The coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me write out the expansions a bit more explicitly.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\). The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNext, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is 20, as I found earlier.\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But only the constant term \\(20\\) in the second expansion will result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors. All other terms will have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they won't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), giving \\(m = 3\\).

The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 6. The exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). \n\nI need the term where the exponent is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\\\\n2k = 6 \\\\\nk = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\). The term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nWait, hold on, that can't be right. Let me check that calculation again. \n\nWait, 6! is 720, and 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yeah, that's correct. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) and the constant term from the second part (which is 20). \n\nSo, multiplying these together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Because when you have two separate expansions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expansion that multiply together to give that specific term.\n\nBut in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first expansion, and the second expansion's constant term is 20, then when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 20, you get 20a^2b^2. So, the coefficient is indeed 20*6 = 120.\n\nWait, but wait, actually, no. Let me think again. The first expansion gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second expansion's constant term is 20. So, when you multiply them, you get 6 * 20 * a^2b^2, which is 120a^2b^2. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nBut hold on, is that correct? Because the second expansion isn't just the constant term; it's the entire expansion. But when you multiply the two expressions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, including the \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), 20, 15/c^2, 6/c^4, 1/c^6 terms.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the product where the second term is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because any other term would introduce a power of \\(c\\), making it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) (with coefficient 6) and the constant term 20 from the second expansion. So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I'm not missing anything, let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these out, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by all the terms in the second part, which include various powers of \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), give a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut wait, no, that's not quite right. Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by, say, \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get a term that's exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) is if it's multiplied by 1 (i.e., the constant term) from the second expansion. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part: 6 (from the first expansion) times 20 (the constant term from the second expansion), which is 120.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\nBut just to double-check, let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding this, we get:\n\n\\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). \n\nIn this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) (if we were looking for \\(a\\)) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), but since we're looking for a specific term without variables, perhaps this analogy isn't perfect.\n\nWait, maybe another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). Let's compute this.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\).\n\nThen, expand \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\).\n\nNow, multiply them together:\n\n\\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\).\n\nIf I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), wait, actually in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present because in the first expansion, the highest power is \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you would need to multiply \\(a^2\\) by \\(b^2\\), but in the first expansion, the cross term is \\(2ab\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps my earlier approach was correct, but in this case, the product doesn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nWait, maybe I need to reconsider. In the original problem, it's \\((a + b)^4\\), so the expansion does include \\(a^2b^2\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, and it's being multiplied by each term in the second expansion.\n\nBut the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second part, but that's not quite right because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. \n\nWait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part that are multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply it by the constant term from the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which, when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is the constant term, which is 20. Therefore, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 20, you get 20a^2b^2, which is the only term in the product that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe there's more to it, but I think I've convinced myself that it's 120.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's consider the entire product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{i=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{i} a^{4 - i}b^i\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\\right)\n\\]\n\nWhen we multiply these two sums together, each term is a product of a term from the first sum and a term from the second sum. So, the general term is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{i} a^{4 - i}b^i \\times \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\n\\]\n\nNow, we're interested in the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we need \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\), so we need \\(4 - i = 2\\) and \\(i = 2\\). So, \\(i = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, for the second part, since we don't want any \\(c\\) terms, we need \\(6 - 2j = 0\\), so \\(j = 3\\), and the coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the term we're interested in is \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). \n\nThus, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's solid. I considered both parts separately, found the relevant coefficients, multiplied them together, and confirmed that the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is by multiplying the constant term from the second expansion. \n\nSo, I'm confident the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts: expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   Calculating the binomial coefficient:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the general term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero (the constant term):\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, in this case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nLet me apply the binomial theorem to \\((a + b)^4\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, setting \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That gives me the term \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). \n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is equal to \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but I notice that the second part of the product, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). That means when I multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part.\n\nHowever, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific term involving \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient will just be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, actually, I think that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on the powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean I just need to take the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part? But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, how much does \\(a^2b^2\\) get multiplied by in terms of the \\(c\\) terms. But then, the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. That seems odd because the question is phrased as \"the coefficient,\" which is usually a scalar.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient considering all possible terms, so it's 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. That doesn't seem right because usually, coefficients are numerical.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get a product where each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficients add up. \n\nWait, no. Actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a scalar, perhaps it's considering only the constant term in \\(c\\). So, we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the question is about a coefficient, which should be a number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression as a single polynomial, but that would require knowing the specific term in the product. Alternatively, maybe the problem is a typo, and it's supposed to be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then we can find the coefficient by multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the constant term from the second part.\n\nGiven that, let me proceed under that assumption. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found to be 6. Then, find the constant term (i.e., the coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two results together.\n\nSo, let's work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, we can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that's not correct because 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) is 720/36 = 20. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, that's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but hold on, I'm not sure if this is the right approach. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have coefficients that are multiples of each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which is a bit ambiguous. If it's asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), then it's not a single number. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120, as I calculated before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because a coefficient is usually a scalar, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense in the context of the question. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression as a single polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a distraction. But that seems unlikely because the second part is being multiplied.\n\nWait, let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two expressions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., depending on the term in the second expansion.\n\nTherefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, it's not a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nGiven that the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\), it's a bit ambiguous. But in standard problems like this, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term in a product of two expressions, and the term doesn't involve the other variables, it usually means that you consider the entire expansion, so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, the coefficient in the product would be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that's a polynomial, not a scalar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 120. I think that's the more likely interpretation because otherwise, the problem wouldn't make much sense in terms of asking for a coefficient, which is typically a scalar.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me check my work again. \n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, as \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, using the binomial expansion, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering the constant term in \\(c\\), is 120.\n\nI think that's the answer. It makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is the constant term, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"
