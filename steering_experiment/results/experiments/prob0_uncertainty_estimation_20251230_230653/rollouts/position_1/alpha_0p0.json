    "text": " I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting used to these kinds of problems, but I'll take it slow.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((x + y)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\), where \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}\\) is the binomial coefficient, which can be found using combinations. So, I think I can apply this theorem to both parts of the given expression separately and then multiply the results.\n\nLet me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). I need to find the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\). So, using the binomial theorem, each term in this expansion will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is equal to \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Got that down.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if I need to expand this part as well, but I think I do because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Wait, that might be a problem. Let me think.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might not need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me check.\n\nWait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in the first part is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and in the second part, I need to find the constant term because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), giving me the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm understanding this correctly. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and in the second part, I need the term that is just a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) because when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by that constant, it will give me a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). If I multiply it by any other term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), which isn't what we want. So, yes, I need the constant term from the second expansion.\n\nOkay, so now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, using the binomial theorem, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, it's \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nWait, let me check that calculation again because I think I might have made a mistake. 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 times 6) is 720 divided by 36, which is indeed 20. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, the constant term in the second part is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two parts together, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20 from the second part, giving me \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any mistakes. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120, so the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but another thought: when I multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20, so yes, 6 * 20 is 120. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), but in this case, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific term involving \\(c\\), perhaps I'm correct in taking the constant term from the second part.\n\nWait, but actually, no, because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, that term would be the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, that's correct.\n\nWait another thought: but the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\). That would only happen when the term from the second part is a constant, because if it's a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the product would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, which isn't what we want. So, yes, only the constant term from the second part will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, I think my earlier conclusion is correct. The coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me just verify everything again because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in combinatorics.\n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. Correct.\n\nFor \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We set the exponent equal to zero: \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Thus, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). Correct.\n\nTherefore, the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me think if there's any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). For example, if there was a term with \\(c^1\\) and another with \\(c^{-1}\\), their product would be \\(c^0\\), so maybe I need to consider those as well. But wait, no, because in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is either a positive power of \\(c\\) or a negative power, but when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) unless you multiply by the constant term. Because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make the product have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term contributes.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me think about the entire expansion. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand both, you get a product of two polynomials. Each term in the product will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k} b^{k} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present. That requires \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, for each \\(m\\), we have a term \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, and the expression is a product. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that's independent of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because any term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times something involving \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering only the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again: it says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term in the second part. Because if you take any other term from the second part, it would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, making the product have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term in the second part.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but to be absolutely sure, let me think about it differently. Let's compute the entire expansion step by step.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\n\nSo, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2} b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n\\]\n\nNow, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But we're only interested in the terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\), which only happens when the second term is the constant term, 20. So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6 and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, the overall coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), we would have to consider the corresponding terms, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), we only consider the constant term from the second part.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough times, and each time I come to the same conclusion. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). We need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which occurs when \\(k = 2\\).\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\).\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   The constant term is 20.\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part.\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when expanding expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\), we can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), I can expand this part first.\n\nLet me write down the expansion for \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, the terms will be:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} a^4 b^0 = 1 \\times a^4 \\times 1 = a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} a^3 b^1 = 4 \\times a^3 b = 4a^3b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 \\times a^2 b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} a^1 b^3 = 4 \\times a b^3 = 4ab^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} a^0 b^4 = 1 \\times 1 \\times b^4 = b^4\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Looking at the expansion, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 6. But wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the expansion of both parts and how they multiply together.\n\nLet me think: when I multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I'm only interested in the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some term in the second expansion. However, since the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) when multiplying. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. \n\nBut no, actually, that's not the case. The question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by the entire second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of all the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. \n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. That would make more sense because otherwise, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion, resulting in a sum over all powers of \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's considering the entire coefficient, which includes the terms from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient itself a polynomial, not a single number. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is looking for the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nLet me think again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. \n\nBut that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nLet me check that. If that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem again. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\); it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it again. If the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's intended to consider the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, I think that's the correct interpretation. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{3}(1/c)^3 = 20 \\times c^0 = 20\\). So, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, if I didn't consider the \\(c^0\\) term, and just multiplied 6 by the entire expansion, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a single number. Since the problem is asking for a coefficient, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient when considering the constant term in \\(c\\), so 120 is the answer. \n\nWait, but let me check another approach. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, but the problem might just want the coefficient as a number, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nBut that seems conflicting with the previous result. So, which one is correct? \n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, perhaps it's expecting the coefficient when considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, meaning the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the coefficient in the sense of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. So, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nI think the more accurate interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would be a polynomial. However, since the problem is asking for a coefficient, perhaps it's intended to consider the term where \\(c\\) is eliminated, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient is 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then considering that the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficients do combine. \n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all separate. So, when you multiply these out, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 6 times 20, giving 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by separate variables. But that seems incorrect because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients do combine. \n\nWait, let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, i.e., the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 6 times 20, giving 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, but since the problem is asking for a number, it's more likely that it's expecting the coefficient when \\(c\\) is eliminated, i.e., the constant term. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120. \n\nWait, but let me check another approach. Maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would involve all possible \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, that can't be. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient when considering the term where \\(c\\) is eliminated, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient is 120. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we first expand each part separately.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).

    "text": " I'm a bit confused, but I'll take it slow.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}a^{n - k}b^k\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to \\(n\\). So maybe I can apply that here for the \\((a + b)^4\\) part.\n\nLet me write that down. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) would be the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). Now, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check that: if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). Yep, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I think \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6 because 4 choose 2 is 6. Let me calculate that: 4! / (2! * (4 - 2)!) = (24)/(2 * 2) = 24 / 4 = 6. Okay, so that part is 6. So, the term is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2.\n\nNow, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I have this 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 term, but I also have to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Hmm, that's a good point. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, only the constant term will leave \\(a^2b^2\\) as is, without any \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me think again. If I multiply 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term would be 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 times some power of \\(c\\). But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include any terms where the \\(c\\) parts are multiplied by 1, meaning the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if \\(c\\) is raised to any other power, it wouldn't be a pure \\(a^2b^2\\) term; it would have \\(c\\) factors as well. So, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, and then multiply that by 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion. So, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the sum from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}c^{-m}\\) which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so 6 - 2m = 0. Solving for m: 6 = 2m, so m = 3. So, the term where m = 3 is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20 because 6 choose 3 is 20. Let me check that: 6! / (3! * 3!) = (720)/(6 * 6) = 720 / 36 = 20. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. Let me go through it again.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term 20. So, when I multiply these two, the term 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 * 20 is 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. So, the coefficient is 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expansion as a product of two polynomials. But since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), I don't need to consider any cross terms or anything else. So, yeah, 6 * 20 is 120. I think that's correct.\n\nWait, another way to check is to consider that each part is independent. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so the product is 6*20=120. So, that's consistent.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I think the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4-k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6-m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6-2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I know that when expanding expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\), I can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nIn this case, the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\), so \\(n = 4\\). I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2 because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nLet me write out the general term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I want \\(a^2b^2\\), so I set \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2} b^{2}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. \n\nLet me denote \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is \\(A \\times B\\). Since \\(A\\) contains terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(B\\) contains terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the variables are different. That means when I multiply them, the coefficients will multiply as well, but the variables will just be multiplied together. \n\nBut the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in \\(B\\), any term in \\(B\\) will just multiply the entire \\(A\\) expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(A \\times B\\) will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(B\\). \n\nWait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficients of the terms multiply if the variables are the same. But in this case, the variables in \\(A\\) are \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and in \\(B\\) are \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the variables will all be different. \n\nSo, for example, a term in \\(A\\) like \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term in \\(B\\) like \\(c^3\\) would give \\(a^2b^2c^3\\). But since the question is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\), I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(A \\times B\\) is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients in \\(B\\). \n\nWait, that might not be correct either. Let me think. When you multiply two expressions, each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), so the coefficient of a specific term in \\(A\\) (like \\(a^2b^2\\)) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). But since the variables in \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are different, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) when multiplied by any term in \\(B\\) will result in a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\(A \\times B\\) is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). Because when you distribute, each term in \\(B\\) will multiply the entire \\(A\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 (from \\(A\\)) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(B\\).\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check. If I have \\(A = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\) and \\(B = \\text{some expression}\\), then \\(A \\times B = 6a^2b^2 \\times B + \\text{other terms}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A \\times B\\) is indeed 6 multiplied by the entire expression \\(B\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient, and \\(B\\) can be considered as a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(B\\). \n\nBut actually, when you're looking for a specific term like \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the other variables, you just need to consider how the coefficients multiply. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\(A\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the product \\(A \\times B\\) will have terms that are products of terms from \\(A\\) and terms from \\(B\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(B\\), each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, that can't be, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term, and when multiplied by terms from \\(B\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient from \\(A\\) times the entire sum of coefficients in \\(B\\), but that doesn't make sense because each term in \\(B\\) has its own coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". But in the product \\(A \\times B\\), each term will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) by a term in \\(B\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A \\times B\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) by the constant term in \\(B\\) (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in \\(B\\) that has a power of \\(c\\), you'll end up with a term that has \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is not just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, to clarify, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\(A \\times B\\) is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\). Because only that term will result in a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, I need to find two things:\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nThen, multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient in the product.\n\nOkay, so let's start with the first part. As I did before, using the binomial theorem on \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nAgain, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents, this becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k - k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I multiply the two coefficients I found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). \n\nSo, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, that's correct. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a term where \\(c^0\\), which is the middle term, and that's when \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), that's correct too. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. \n\nYes, that seems right. I don't think I made any errors in the calculations. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiplying them together. \n\n1. Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Now, since we're multiplying this entire expansion by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, the entire expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = 6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\right)\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, but actually, since each term in the second expansion is a power of \\(c\\), and we're just multiplying by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, no, that might not be correct. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, each term will be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{6 - 2m}\\) for some \\(m\\). So, if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nWait, but actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut let me check: the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because I think I might be overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Since the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), each term will contribute a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the product of 6 and the sum of the coefficients of the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\)? The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\), so I think it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of two separate binomial expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), so the total coefficient would be 6 * sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of any term in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\) is 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), you have to sum all the coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2 c^{k}\\), for any \\(k\\). Therefore, you sum over all \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the second expansion is independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when you multiply by \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm wrong because perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) or something, but the problem doesn't specify, so I think it's just 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me compute the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately and see.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n- \\(a^4\\): coefficient 1\n- \\(a^3b\\): coefficient 4\n- \\(a^2b^2\\): coefficient 6\n- \\(a b^3\\): coefficient 4\n- \\(b^4\\): coefficient 1\n\nSo, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\):\n\nThe expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each term \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\) will be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each \\(m\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on the power of \\(c\\). So, that means we have to sum all the coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2 c^{k}\\) for any \\(k\\). So, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nSince the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(\\text{sum of terms in } c\\right)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2 c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then we would have to compute 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) where \\(6 - 2m = k\\). But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I should compute it another way. Let me compute the product step by step.\n\nThe product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me denote \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, the product \\(P \\times Q\\) is a polynomial where each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\).\n\nIn \\(P\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has coefficient 6. In \\(Q\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), with coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\).\n\nSo, when we multiply \\(P \\times Q\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\).\n\nBut since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from \\(Q\\) and multiply by 6. The sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\) is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify this by considering specific terms. For example, the constant term in \\(Q\\) is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2 c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSimilarly, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2 c^2\\) would be when \\(6 - 2m = 2\\), so \\(m = 2\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\), so 6 * 15 = 90.\n\nSimilarly, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2 c^{-2}\\) would be when \\(6 - 2m = -2\\), so \\(m = 4\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\), so 6 * 15 = 90.\n\nAnd so on for other powers of \\(c\\). So, each term \\(a^2b^2 c^{k}\\) has a coefficient of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), where \\(k = 6 - 2m\\).\n\nBut the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), so that would be the sum of all these coefficients for different \\(k\\). So, sum over all \\(m\\) from 0 to 6 of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\).\n\nSince \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), the total sum is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute it another way. Let me compute \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately and then see.\n\nWe already know that \\((a + b)^4\\) has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as:\n\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1 for \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, c^0, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\) respectively.\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by this, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of these coefficients, resulting in terms:\n\n- \\(6a^2b^2 c^6\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 c^4\\) with coefficient 6*6=36\n- \\(6a^2b^2 c^2\\) with coefficient 6*15=90\n- \\(6a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6*20=120\n- \\(6a^2b^2 c^{-2}\\) with coefficient 6*15=90\n- \\(6a^2b^2 c^{-4}\\) with coefficient 6*6=36\n- \\(6a^2b^2 c^{-6}\\) with coefficient 6*1=6\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, actually, the coefficients from the second expansion are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1 for \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, c^0, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\) respectively. So, when you multiply each by 6, you get:\n\n- 6*1 = 6 for \\(a^2b^2 c^6\\)\n- 6*6 = 36 for \\(a^2b^2 c^4\\)\n- 6*15 = 90 for \\(a^2b^2 c^2\\)\n- 6*20 = 120 for \\(a^2b^2 c^0\\)\n- 6*15 = 90 for \\(a^2b^2 c^{-2}\\)\n- 6*6 = 36 for \\(a^2b^2 c^{-4}\\)\n- 6*1 = 6 for \\(a^2b^2 c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, each of these terms has a coefficient as above. Now, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then we need to sum all these coefficients. That is:\n\n6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6 = let's compute this.\n\n6 + 36 = 42\n\n42 + 90 = 132\n\n132 + 120 = 252\n\n252 + 90 = 342\n\n342 + 36 = 378\n\n378 + 6 = 384\n\nYes, that adds up to 384. So, that confirms it. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I had to compute this without expanding, I could recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion really 64? Because when you set \\(c = 1\\), you get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), yes. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 384.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " I remember that when dealing with expansions, binomial coefficients come into play, so maybe I should use the binomial theorem here.\n\nFirst, let me recall the binomial theorem. It states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, I can apply this to both parts of the given expression: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nStarting with \\((a + b)^4\\), I want to find the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me write out the expansion using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I need the exponent of \\(a\\) to be 2 and the exponent of \\(b\\) to be 2. So, setting \\(4 - k = 2\\) gives \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), and the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of a specific term, but wait, the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, actually, I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when considering \\(a^2b^2\\), because when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(c\\) terms will multiply with other terms, but since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) part can be any term, right? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider the product as separate parts: the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and any term from the second part. However, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all terms in the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient will just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Hmm, but that might not be correct because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to consider that when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will contribute to different parts of the overall product, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), I need to find the coefficient in the second expansion that would result in a term without \\(c\\) when multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term from the second expansion, say \\(c^k\\), the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nSo, let me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem.\n\nThe general term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20.\n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient will be the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 and 20.\n\nTherefore, multiplying them together: 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second expansion with coefficient 20. When you multiply these together, the resulting term is \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The logic seems sound: find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, and multiply them together to get the final coefficient in the product. Yep, that should be the correct approach.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\).

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply this to both parts of the given expression separately and then combine them.\n\nLet me start with the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this should expand to the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). So, the general term here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). \n\nNow, I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Solving for \\(k\\), if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nLet me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is equal to \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nOkay, now I need to consider the second part of the expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't directly affect the terms involving \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem quite right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we are looking for the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), does that mean we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? \n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, as I calculated earlier.\n\nBut wait, that seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something here. Let me consider the entire expression. The entire expression is a product of two expansions. When you multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), ..., \\(c^0\\), ..., \\(c^{-6}\\). \n\nBut when the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's probably referring to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because we're just asked for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms. But that would require me to consider all the cross terms. Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, since the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the second part, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k} b^{k} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(k = 2\\), as before. So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, for each such term, we multiply by the corresponding term from the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient is the sum of all possible \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for all \\(m\\), multiplied by 6. But that can't be right because the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\)? That seems high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. In that case, we need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). \n\nSo, let's recast this. We need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents match. So, from the first part, as before, the coefficient is 6. From the second part, the coefficient when \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But wait, the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it again. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), giving 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so that can't be right.\n\nI think I must have misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we can treat the second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a sum involving \\(c\\), which isn't a number. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms. So, that would mean that each term in the expansion is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), giving 384. \n\nBut that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is just 6, which seems too simple.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), giving 384. But I'm not entirely confident about this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that the entire term is \\(a^2b^2\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 6 times 20, giving 120. \n\nI think that's more likely what the problem is asking for, because otherwise, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that would imply a sum over all \\(c\\) terms, which doesn't make much sense in this context. So, perhaps the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me confirm this. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\), I think it's intended to consider all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), giving 384.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve multiplying the terms from both expansions. So, each term in the product is a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number, which contradicts the problem's phrasing.\n\nTherefore, I must have made a mistake in my initial approach. Let me try a different method. Perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and the second part is a distraction. So, the coefficient would just be 6. But that seems too simple, and I suspect the problem is more involved than that.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), giving 384. But I'm not sure if that's the intended interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, which would include all possible terms, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nI'm getting confused here. Let me try to break it down again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, you get a sum of terms where each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by every term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is a sum involving \\(c\\), which isn't a number. Therefore, I must have misinterpreted the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that \\(c\\) can be any term, but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). But that still doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is considered as a single polynomial, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that again results in a polynomial, not a number.\n\nI think I'm stuck here. Let me try to look for similar problems or think about how coefficients work in products of polynomials. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables add up to that specific term.\n\nIn this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one polynomial and \\(c\\) is in the other, the variables are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense as a single coefficient.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the answer would be 6.\n\nBut that seems too straightforward, and I suspect the problem is intended to involve both parts. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would involve both parts. So, let's try that approach.\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we need to find the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. From the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier. From the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need the term where \\(c^0\\), which occurs when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel each other out. \n\nUsing the binomial theorem on the second part, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the entire expression includes \\(c\\), we're actually looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think that's the correct approach.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply the two coefficients together to get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the terms from each part that contribute to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\n1. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I know that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here for the \\((a + b)^4\\) part.\n\nLet me write that out. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That means I need to consider the product of the two expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by some terms from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nHowever, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That suggests that the terms from the second part might not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), or maybe they do, but in a way that just multiplies the coefficient by something. Hmm, let me think.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me clarify: The entire expression is a product of two separate expressions, one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), each with their own coefficients. \n\nBut the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if I think about the product, each term in the first expansion (like \\(a^2b^2\\)) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not any of these other terms. Wait, that seems confusing because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, right? Because if you have \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\), that's a different term unless \\(k = 0\\). So, actually, the only term that would result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) terms) is when \\(k = 0\\). \n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, does that mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 1, or does it mean that the coefficient is just 6, regardless of the other terms? Hmm, I'm a bit confused now.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, in the expansion of the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the only way for the term to have \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second expansion. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you just get \\(a^2b^2\\), and that's the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's compute that.\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, from the first part, it's 6, and from the second part, it's 20. Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply the two expressions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first will be multiplied by all terms in the second, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have some power of \\(c\\), so they won't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nBut wait, another thought: When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. In this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and any term from the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in the expansion is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m (1/c)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^kb^{4 - k} c^{m - (6 - m)} = a^kb^{4 - k} c^{2m - 6}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. However, since the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), unless the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, the term won't just be \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is only one term, as we found earlier. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part, because the variables are independent. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and from the second part, since we're only considering the constant term, it's 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Suppose I didn't consider the second part correctly. Let me think: The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with various powers of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that \\(k = 0\\), because otherwise, it's \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, yes, only the term where \\(k = 0\\) contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: If the problem was just \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. If we have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\text{something}\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the coefficient of 1 in the \"something\". Because when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the \"something\", but only the constant term contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, in this case, the \"something\" is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and the coefficient of 1 in that is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these coefficients together gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression as \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps I can first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then, since the other part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the entire coefficient will just be that multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all terms in the second part. But wait, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded will have terms involving powers of \\(c\\). Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), maybe I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and then the entire coefficient will be that times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the terms in \\((a + b)^4\\) that have \\(a^2b^2\\), which is just one term, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, is that right? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a different power of \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but let me check that. Suppose I have \\( (a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4 \\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. Now, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, it will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So the sum of all coefficients in this expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which would be \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64 \\).\n\nSo, if I take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and multiply it by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, that seems plausible, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is multiplied by it, each term in the second polynomial will contribute a factor that's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the respective coefficient from the second part.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, each term is of the form \\(k c^n\\), where \\(k\\) is the coefficient. So when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term \\(k c^n\\), you get \\(k a^2b^2 c^n\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that's the sum of all \\(k\\) from the second part, because each \\(k c^n\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) gives \\(k a^2b^2 c^n\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all \\(k\\) times \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^n\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients \\(k\\) from the second expansion. So, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), perhaps I can treat the second part as a single term with a coefficient, which is the sum of all its coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Another approach: think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it will produce terms like \\(a^2b^2 c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, to compute the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can substitute \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) to confirm the sum of coefficients. The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficients are \\(\\binom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\), which are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. The sum of these coefficients is \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\), which matches \\(2^6 = 64\\). So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me think again: is there another way this could be approached? Maybe by using multinomial coefficients or something else?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the entire product as a product of two polynomials and focus on the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears. But since the second polynomial only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " I'm a bit confused, but I'll take it slowly.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\), right? So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nThe expression has two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that the term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\). Since this term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), maybe the coefficient comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and the other part just contributes a constant factor? I'm not entirely sure, but let's check.\n\nLet me first expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). We want the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Plugging that into the binomial coefficient, we get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, what about the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? I need to figure out if this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe this part just contributes a multiplier to the entire expansion. So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that would be the term that doesn't change the exponent of \\(c\\), thus not affecting the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then I multiply it by a term from the second part, say \\(c^k \\cdot \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - k}\\), which simplifies to \\(c^{2k - 6}\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way for the product to have \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is if the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That means \\(2k - 6 = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term in the second part that we need is when \\(k = 3\\), which would be the constant term.\n\nSo, let me calculate that. The general term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Plugging \\(k = 3\\) into the binomial coefficient, we get \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. That is, \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the entire expansion. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by all terms from the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears when multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion.\n\nSo, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is indeed 120. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nI think I've got it. The coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). We need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This occurs when \\(k = 2\\), giving us:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 a^2 b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). This occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), giving us \\(k = 3\\). The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two parts:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of the constant term (i.e., the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).

I need to find the coefficient of the constant term, which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me think about how that works. Each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, I need the exponent \\(6 - 2k\\) to be zero.

So, maybe I can expand each part separately and then multiply them together, but I'm not sure if that's the most efficient way. Alternatively, since I only need the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't have to expand everything, just focus on the terms that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me explore that.\n\nStarting with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). I know that the binomial expansion of \\((a + b)^n\\) is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(n\\) of \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, for \\(n = 4\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). Specifically, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(k = 2\\), right?

So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of some term here, but wait, I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since the first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), maybe these variables don't interfere with each other? So, perhaps the terms in the second expansion won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as in the first part, multiplied by the entire second expansion? Wait, that doesn't sound right.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since the first expression has only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and the second has only \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the variables don't overlap. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since none of those terms have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient isn't just 6, because the second part is a sum of terms. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nLet me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and none of the terms in the second expansion affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), that means the coefficient will be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, they might be considering the entire expression as a product, and they want the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, in other words, in the expansion of the entire product, collect all terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\), each multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and then sum up their coefficients. But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think the coefficient will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be 6 * 64 = 384? Hmm, but that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. Then, when you multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, it becomes 6 times that coefficient times a\u00b2b\u00b2 times c^k for some k. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2, regardless of the c terms, we can sum all the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Because in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term a\u00b2b\u00b2 from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient for a\u00b2b\u00b2 in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 in the product is the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient when multiplied by a\u00b2b\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 times c^k for some specific k, but I don't think so because it just says \"the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2\". So, perhaps it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that approach. Let me compute the sum of coefficients in the second expansion: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of coefficients, we set c = 1, so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me consider another approach. Maybe I should expand both parts and see. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). As I did before, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\n\nSo, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is when k=2, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).\n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for m from 0 to 6.\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for each m.\n\nTherefore, the product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for each m from 0 to 6.\n\nNow, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're considering all terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c. So, each of these terms contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the total coefficient is the sum over all m of \\(6 \\cdot \\dbinom{6}{m}\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}\\).\n\nBut the sum \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\), because the sum of binomial coefficients for a given n is 2^n. So, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nBut let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression, provided that the variables don't interfere. But in this case, since the first expression has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and the second has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the variables are independent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, because each term in the second expression contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I found earlier. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion manually. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}\\), ..., \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}\\). Let's compute each:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\)\n\nAdding these up: 1 + 6 = 7, 7 + 15 = 22, 22 + 20 = 42, 42 + 15 = 57, 57 + 6 = 63, 63 + 1 = 64. So, yes, the sum is 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think if there's another way this could be approached. Maybe by considering generating functions or something else, but I think the approach I took is solid.\n\nAlternatively, suppose I consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, after going through this step by step, I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), which is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   Thus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), I can expand it term by term.\n\nLet me write down the expansion for \\((a + b)^4\\). The exponents of \\(a\\) will start from 4 and go down to 0, while the exponents of \\(b\\) will go from 0 up to 4. Each term will be multiplied by a binomial coefficient. So, the expansion would look like:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the coefficients, we have:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, the expansion becomes:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nNow, I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient.\n\nLet me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that might not be correct because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. However, since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the other part. But that doesn't make sense because the other part does involve \\(c\\), so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product of both expansions. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient will be the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in that expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero. So, actually, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nAh, that makes sense. So, first, I find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nSo, let me focus on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me compute it properly:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 20\n\\]\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)).\n\nMultiplying them together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the other expansion), giving 120.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the constant term, which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.

So maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nLet me confirm that. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term with \\(a\\) squared and \\(b\\) squared. So in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(c\\) terms will just multiply whatever coefficient comes from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat the two parts separately and then multiply their coefficients, but wait, no, actually, the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe we can just take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the terms would involve \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will contribute a coefficient that's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient is just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not quite right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those terms would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but maybe that's correct.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let's denote \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then the product is \\(A \\times B\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is a specific term, and when you multiply \\(A\\) by \\(B\\), each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean that in \\(B\\), we need terms that don't involve \\(c\\) either. But wait, that's not possible because \\(B\\) is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So actually, when you multiply \\(A\\) by \\(B\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(B\\). Because each term in \\(B\\) is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which has no \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term in \\(B\\) that has \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(B\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(A \\times B\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(B\\).\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So first, I'll find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), and then I'll find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together to get the final coefficient.\n\nOkay, let's start with \\((a + b)^4\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) can be done using the binomial theorem, which states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\). So in this case, \\(x = a\\), \\(y = b\\), and \\(n = 4\\).\n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), because \\(y^k = b^2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, we can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).\n\nSimplifying each term, \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = c^{-m}\\), so each term becomes \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) and solve for \\(m\\):\n\n\\(6 - 2m = 0\\)\n\n\\(2m = 6\\)\n\n\\(m = 3\\)\n\nSo the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\binom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\binom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's incorrect because 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so it's 720 divided by (6 \u00d7 6) which is 36, so 720 \u00f7 36 is 20. So the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So that would be 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by 20 (the constant term), which equals 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, in the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we only care about the terms in the second expansion that don't involve \\(c\\), because those are the only ones that won't introduce any \\(c\\) factors when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in the second expansion), giving 120.\n\nWait, but let me just double-check my calculations. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, that's correct because \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). And the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when the exponent is zero, which happens at \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\), that's correct too. So 6 times 20 is indeed 120.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct coefficient.

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\), where \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}\\) is the binomial coefficient, which can be found using combinations. So, maybe I can apply that here for the \\((a + b)^4\\) part.\n\nLet me write that down. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). \n\nNow, I specifically need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, in the expansion, \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) should equal \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nLet me set up the equation: \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Solving \\(4 - k = 2\\) gives \\(k = 2\\). So, the term where \\(k = 2\\) will give me \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nNow, let me compute the binomial coefficient for \\(k = 2\\). That's \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I think \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2! \\cdot (4 - 2)!}\\). Calculating that, \\(4! = 24\\), \\(2! = 2\\), so \\(24 / (2 \\cdot 2) = 24 / 4 = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nOkay, so the first part gives me a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\). Now, I need to consider the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait a second, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm trying to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, that might be the case because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). \n\nLet me think. If I'm multiplying two expressions together, one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\), then each term in the product will be a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product would come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by any term from the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). That means I'm looking for the term in the product where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, or more specifically, where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which doesn't affect the term. \n\nWait, but actually, no. Because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the product, but the second part is multiplied by the entire first part. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second part, but that doesn't seem right because the second part has terms with \\(c\\) which aren't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms involving \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is some exponent. \n\nWait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean I need to sum over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion? But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term would have a different power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes its own coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. Let me consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one polynomial and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in another, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). \n\nWait, so if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in the product is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\), right? Because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait, so each term in the product would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I'm looking for the term where \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) is \\(a^2b^2\\). That happens when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as I found earlier, so that's when \\(k = 2\\), giving a coefficient of 6 from the first part.\n\nNow, for each of these terms, the exponent of \\(c\\) would be \\(6 - 2m\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that means I need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) values, because each \\(m\\) gives a different power of \\(c\\), but all of them contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the term from the first expansion.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because if I sum over all \\(m\\), I would be effectively multiplying the 6 by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is indeed \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense, because then I would need to find the coefficient where both \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^0\\) occur in the product.\n\nWait, that would make more sense because otherwise, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which seems unlikely. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\).\n\nLet me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the product is a combination of a term from each polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of the products of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and each term from the second polynomial. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nWait, but that seems correct because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, if the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), its sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems high. Let me see if that's correct by considering a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 2, so 1*2=2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would be 1*2=2. But in reality, when you expand, you get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1 for each term, but in the product, it's multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^1\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^{-1}\\) is 1. So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 1 + 1 = 2, which matches the earlier calculation.\n\nSimilarly, for \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\) times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 2^2 = 4, so 1*4=4. When expanded, the terms would include \\(a^2c^2\\), \\(a^2/c^0\\), etc., but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would indeed be 4.\n\nWait, so in that case, the approach seems correct. So, applying that to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the answer would be 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I might be overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by any term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire product is a single expression, and I'm to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would indeed be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, so 384.\n\nWait, but another thought: perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would be different because then I would have to find the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nWait, that makes more sense because if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's possible that it's referring to the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that would mean I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). Hmm, I'm a bit confused now.\n\nLet me try to clarify. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that each term in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), contributes to the coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient would be the sum over all possible exponents of \\(c\\) of the product of the coefficients from each part.\n\nWait, but that would be the same as 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\).\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I would have to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would require me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), because in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero occurs when the number of \\(c\\) terms equals the number of \\(1/c\\) terms, which is when \\(m = 3\\). So, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier conclusion. So, which is it? Is the problem asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), or is it asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)? The problem statement is a bit ambiguous.\n\nLooking back at the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, that would mean I need to sum over all possible exponents of \\(c\\), which would give me 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me test this with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 for each term involving \\(a\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 1 + 1 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 1 + 1 = 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is indeed 2, which is 1 (from the first part) times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 2.\n\nSimilarly, in \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\) times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 4, so 1 * 4 = 4. When expanded, the terms would include \\(a^2c^2\\), \\(a^2\\), \\(a^2/c^2\\), etc., so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would indeed be 4.\n\nTherefore, applying that to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that if the problem was asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, depending on interpretation, the answer could be 384 or 120. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nBut I'm still a bit uncertain because sometimes problems like this expect you to consider only the constant term with respect to another variable. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think the correct approach is to consider all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would give me 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum of all such terms, which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the product is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute both possibilities and see which one makes sense.\n\nFirst, let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). That would be 6 * sum of coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nNow, let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). For that, I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) includes a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That occurs when the number of \\(c\\) terms equals the number of \\(1/c\\) terms, which is when we choose 3 \\(c\\) terms and 3 \\(1/c\\) terms. So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, depending on the interpretation, the answer could be either 384 or 120. But given that the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the intended interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so the answer would be 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes in these problems, when they ask for the coefficient of a term involving some variables, they might be implying that the other variables should be at their lowest power, typically zero. So, perhaps the intended answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the expansion includes terms with \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me try to compute it step by step more carefully.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), which gives us:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, consider the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem as well:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nEach term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term in the product is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWe are interested in the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, which happens when \\(k = 2\\) as found earlier. So, the term from the first expansion is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and we need to multiply it by each term from the second expansion:\n\n\\[\n6a^2b^2 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nThis results in:\n\n\\[\n6 \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term in the product is \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. \n\nSince the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nSo, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that if the problem was asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the answer would be 120. But since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let me compute the entire product and see what the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is.\n\nThe product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I expand this, it's the sum over all possible combinations of terms from each expansion.\n\nBut since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " I'm a bit confused because there are two different parts to this expression: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). I think I need to handle each part separately and then see how they combine to get the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the part with \\(c\\) doesn't affect that term? Or does it?\n\nLet me think. The expression is a product of two binomials: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this product, each term from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared in the first part, and then see what the corresponding term is in the second part. But wait, does the second part affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)? No, because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), so when I multiply, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will only come from the first part. So maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific term, not the entire expansion.\n\nWait, no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to clarify: I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), I can find its coefficient there and then, since the other part of the product is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the question is just asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all terms, but since the other part is in terms of \\(c\\), the coefficient would include terms from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it would become \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. That doesn't seem right. Maybe the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then considering the other part as a separate factor. But that seems odd.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, I need to find the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the other part is in terms of \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every possible term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. So maybe the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and ignoring the other part? But that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, or maybe I'm misunderstanding it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Hmm, that might be the case. Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be a sum over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), and the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part is irrelevant for this term. But that seems odd because the entire product is given, so maybe the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, making the coefficient a polynomial. But the question is just asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would make more sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. So perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, resulting in \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and since the other part is in terms of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is just a distraction. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I should just compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then, since the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient remains the same. So let's try that.\n\nFirst, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, considering the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6.\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms of the form \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) with coefficients \\(6 \\times \\binom{6}{m}\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would require the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero because \\(a^2b^2c^0 = a^2b^2\\). Therefore, we need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times \\binom{6}{3}\\). Calculating \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{3} c^{6 - 6} = 20 c^0 = 20\\). Therefore, when I multiply this by \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which has a coefficient of 6, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is indeed \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). This occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " I remember that when dealing with expansions, the binomial theorem is really useful. \n\nFirst, I think I should handle each part of the expression separately and then combine them. So, the expression has two main parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can probably focus on the first part because the second part might not affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, actually, let me make sure. The second part is multiplied by the first, so when I expand everything, I might have terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would come from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by some term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't matter here because they won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Hmm, that seems right. So, maybe I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the other part contributes a constant factor, or maybe it doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), that term will come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (if any) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because any other terms in the second expansion would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the term not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. \n\nLet me start with \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^n\\) is given by \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, for \\(n = 4\\), the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(k = 2\\), because \\(n - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, we get \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 because that's the constant term. So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) and solve for \\(m\\). \n\nSubtracting 6 from both sides: \\(-2m = -6\\). Dividing both sides by -2: \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need to multiply the coefficients we found. That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). \n\nCalculating that: 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6, and the constant term in the second expansion as 20, so multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct. I don't think I missed anything here. The key was realizing that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by the constant term in the second part, so their coefficients multiply to give the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Yeah, I think that's right.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for each part separately and then combine the results.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

I remember the binomial theorem, which says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, for \\(n = 4\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), each multiplied by a binomial coefficient.\n\nI specifically need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) will be when \\(k = 2\\), because the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(k\\), and the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - k\\).

So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nWait a second, but the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I also need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Because when I multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Let me think about that.\n\nWait, no, actually, when I multiply the two expressions, every term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all possible products where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts give me \\(a^2b^2\\) and the \\(c\\) parts can be anything. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, maybe the coefficient is just the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, that might be the case. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part can be considered as a single term when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c\\) to some power. So, if I'm just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it's \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) something with \\(c\\). But if I'm just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the answer is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Let me check what the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is.\n\nThe sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because in the original problem, it's \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which is a sum of terms like \\(c^k\\) with coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part (which is 64). So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and any term from the second part will contribute a coefficient, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms multiplied by 6. So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another thought: maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem statement just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, perhaps it's considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything, so the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think about the structure of the product. Each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is of the form \\( \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). Similarly, each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\( \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m} \\).\n\nSo, when you multiply these two, each term will be \\( \\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^{k} c^{6 - 2m} \\).\n\nNow, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then we need to sum over all \\(m\\) such that the term has \\(a^2b^2\\). So, \\(a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\) equals \\(a^2b^2\\) when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and \\(4 - 2 = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nThen, for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, the term from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\), which is \\(6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me verify. The sum of the binomial coefficients for \\(n = 6\\) is indeed \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term in \\(c\\). In that case, I would need to find the coefficient where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, in that case, the coefficient from the second part would be \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), and then the total coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 384. But I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when problems involve multiple variables, they might be looking for a specific term that includes all variables, but in this case, the problem only specifies \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's 384.\n\nWait, let me check again. If the problem had been to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 120. But as it stands, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean adding up all the coefficients from the second part, which is 64, multiplied by 6, giving 384.\n\nWait, another way: if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, so in the product, it's 6 * 64 = 384. That makes sense.\n\nYes, I think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure. Let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 2 * (1 + 1) = 4? Wait, no, because in this case, the second part is \\((c + 1/c)\\), so the sum of coefficients is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 2 * 2 = 4. But in reality, looking at the expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\), which is when you take \\(2ab\\) from the first part and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) from the second part. Wait, no, that's not right because in the first part, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist. Wait, in \\((a + b)^2\\), the terms are \\(a^2\\), \\(2ab\\), and \\(b^2\\). So, \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present in \\((a + b)^2\\). So, maybe my earlier approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\) would be zero, because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present in the first part. So, maybe my initial approach was wrong. That suggests that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero in that case, but according to my earlier method, it would be 2 * 2 = 4, which is incorrect. So, that means my approach is flawed.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is not simply the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of coefficients from the second part. Because in reality, \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when you multiply by the second part, each term in the second part is multiplied by each term in the first part. So, if \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first part, then when you multiply by the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second part, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because each term in the second part will contribute a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but in the case where the first part doesn't have \\(a^2b^2\\), like in \\((a + b)^2\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is zero, regardless of the second part. So, in the original problem, since \\((a + b)^4\\) does have \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient in the product would be 6 times the entire second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply by 6, you get a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because each term from the second expansion contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the earlier example, with \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present in the first expansion. So, in that case, the coefficient is zero, which aligns with the fact that the first part doesn't have \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in our original problem, since the first part does have \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the earlier example, if I take \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{3}{1} = 3\\) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 2, so 3 * 2 = 6. Let me check that. The expansion of \\((a + b)^3\\) is \\(a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) is 3. Then, when multiplied by \\((c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) would be 3 * (1 + 1) = 6, which is correct because each term in the second part contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b\\). So, that seems to work.\n\nTherefore, in our original problem, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, the coefficient in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), so maybe I should think of it as a product of two independent expansions, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate variable. So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 times the entire second expansion, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times each term in the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible terms, and the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, I think it's safe to assume that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let me consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by any term from the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), multiplying it by \\(a^2b^2\\) will give terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) can be any integer. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but in the earlier example, when I had \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present in the first polynomial. So, that aligns with the idea that if the first polynomial doesn't have the term, the product won't either. But in our case, the first polynomial does have \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: if I consider the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, each such term comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by some term from the second polynomial. The coefficient from the first part is 6, and the coefficient from the second part can be any term, so we sum over all possible coefficients from the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute it step by step.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNext, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nEach term in this expansion has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) and a power of \\(c\\) of \\(6 - 2m\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion (which has coefficient 6) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Therefore, the total coefficient contributed by \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\).\n\nSince \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\nI think that's correct. I've checked it in different ways, and each time I get the same answer, so I'm confident it's 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 a^2 b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from the first part (6) and the sum of the coefficients from the second part (64):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((x + y)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply this to both parts of the given expression separately and then multiply them together.\n\nLet me break it down. The expression has two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these are multiplied together, the expansion of each will be multiplied by the expansion of the other. So, I can handle each part separately and then find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, but hold on. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, right? Because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so it doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not right either. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would give me a coefficient that's a product, but actually, since the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would just be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, when I expand both expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which are terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not correct because when you multiply, each term is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part contributes to the overall coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose I have \\( (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k} \\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first will be multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which are \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) with coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply, each term in the product is a product of terms from each expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is a standalone term, and when multiplied by each term from the second expansion, it just becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient just gets multiplied, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate.\n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients from each polynomial where the exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to consider all possible ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be formed in the product.\n\nWait, no, because in the first part, the expansion is only in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is only in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that can't be right because the second expansion is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Since the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product for each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, to find the sum of all coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can set \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives the sum of the coefficients. Let's check that:\n\nWhen \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that logic. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those coefficients becomes a coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by it.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), then it's the same as taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their coefficients to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, yes, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me confirm this another way. Let's consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each \\(m\\). The sum of these coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), as I found earlier.\n\nTherefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each contributing their respective coefficients. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the entire expansion, each term is of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^{k}c^{6 - 2m}\\) with coefficients \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). As \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not missing anything here. Is there another way that \\(a^2b^2\\) could be formed? No, because in the first part, \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\(k = 2\\), and the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), only the exponents of \\(c\\). So, all the terms contributing to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product are exactly the \\(a^2b^2\\) term multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but another thought: when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients add up when the exponents match. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part, because the exponents of \\(c\\) don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, yes, it's 6 times 64.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to find the product of the coefficients where the exponents add up appropriately.

    "text": " I'm a bit confused, but I'll take it slow.\n\nFirst, I know that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply that here for both parts of the expression.\n\nThe expression has two parts multiplied together: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these are multiplied, when I expand both, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, is that right? Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, the entire expression is a product of two expansions, so each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first expansion. But since the entire expression is multiplied by the second expansion, which has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), does that mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some terms from the second expansion? So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion would be multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, all terms will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expanded expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, when you expand the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) terms. But that seems complicated because there are multiple terms. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the part of the expression that's a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. Wait, but the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the entire expression is considered, and we're looking for the coefficient of the term that has exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient would be a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms, which seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only looking for the coefficient in the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), treating the other part as a separate expansion. Hmm, I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. Since the expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions, maybe I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But then, that would give me a term that's \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps I'm supposed to treat the \\(c\\) terms as separate and just consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{2}b^{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{n}\\), where \\(k\\) is such that \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and \\(m\\) is such that \\(c^{n}\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible \\(n\\) of the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. But that seems like the coefficient would be a sum, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, meaning that \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. That makes sense because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), and that's the term we're interested in. So, I think that's the correct approach.\n\nSo, let me proceed with that.\n\nFirst, I'll find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Then, I'll find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, I'll multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nStarting with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). We want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that's when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nI need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. That is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\).\n\nSimplifying each term: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\):\n\n\\(6 - 2m = 0\\)\n\n\\(2m = 6\\)\n\n\\(m = 3\\).\n\nSo, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we multiply the two coefficients we found: 6 and 20.\n\nSo, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. That seems correct because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expanded \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and found the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. That also seems correct because \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiplied them together: 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"
