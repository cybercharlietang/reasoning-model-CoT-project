    "text": " So, I think that term occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6 in \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the expansion of the second part as well, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Maybe I can expand that separately and then multiply the two expansions together. But hold on, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion? Hmm, no, that's not right either because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, perhaps I need to find all the terms in the second expansion and then realize that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds a coefficient multiplied by each term. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion? But that seems too simplistic. Alternatively, perhaps the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion. But wait, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a Laurent polynomial in \\(c\\). The sum of its coefficients would be obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) makes each term just 1, so the sum is the sum of the coefficients. Let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too large. Let me think again. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all the terms in the other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and when you multiply by the entire second expansion, each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by 6. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term in the second expansion is 6 times that term. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is just the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient, not considering \\(c\\). Wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that exists in the product. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, but that would mean it's a Laurent polynomial, which doesn't make sense as a coefficient. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire product. That makes more sense. So, let me approach it that way. So, first, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is the middle term when expanded. Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 120. \n\nWait, let me verify that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which is 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when expanding, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**  \n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where the exponents of a and b are both 2. That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion. So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), right? Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I need to expand that as well, but wait, do I need to consider the expansion of the second part for this problem? Let me think. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of the second part. But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not multiplied by any terms involving \\(c\\). Hmm, does that mean I'm just looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? Or is the problem expecting me to consider some interaction between the two parts? Let me read the problem again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, so when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when you multiply the two polynomials, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, when you multiply it by each term in the second part, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that can't be right because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't present unless multiplied by 1. But in the expansion of the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term (the term without \\(c\\)) would be the middle term, which is when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) balance out. So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part. That way, the constant term would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, which would be the only term in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears without any \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, if the problem is considering the entire expression, maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems unlikely because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would actually involve multiplying by the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe the problem is written differently. Let me check the original problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, in the expanded form of the entire product, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, and what's the coefficient in front of it. Since the first part gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), when you multiply them, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself (without any \\(c\\) terms) would only come from the constant term in the second expansion. Wait, no, because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. I'm getting confused here. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, maybe the problem is a typo, and it's supposed to be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something, but I don't know. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, regardless of the second part. But that seems odd because the entire expression is the product of both. Wait, perhaps the problem is considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) as variables and \\(c\\) as another variable, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would result in the coefficient being a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numbers. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, maybe the problem is actually written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, and then multiply them together. That makes more sense. So, let me proceed under that assumption. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found as 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's do that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) => \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients, which is \\(6 * 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me try to clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, since \\((a + b)^4\\) contributes a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate expansion, then when you multiply them together, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem right because the question is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term from the \\(c\\) expansion. That is, the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, so \\(c^0\\). That might make sense. Let me try that approach.\n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we've already found to be 6. Then, we need to find the constant term (the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that part using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. \n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so when you multiply them, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a coefficient, which is a single number. Therefore, the more reasonable interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 20, giving 120.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't seem right because the question is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", implying a single numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 20, leading to 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the constant term. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Setting the exponent equal to zero: 6 - 2m = 0 \u2192 m = 3. So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). So, that's correct. Therefore, the constant term is indeed 20.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120. Wait, but just to make sure, let me think if there's another way this could be interpreted. Suppose the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But in that case, the coefficient would not be a single number but a polynomial. Since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a single number, I think the correct interpretation is that they want the coefficient when multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\), which gives 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. But the problem didn't specify the \\(c\\) terms, so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but without worrying about the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 20, giving 120.\n\nWait, but let me consider that maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, without considering \\(c\\). That is, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but perhaps the problem is only concerned with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are just part of the expression. But that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. That seems reasonable.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\), and the question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), which would be a polynomial, but the question is phrased as \"the coefficient\", implying a single number. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 20, leading to 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(c^0\\), which is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that can't be right because the entire expression is the product of the two expansions. So, if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you have to consider all the terms from the second expansion that multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first expansion, and the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), then when you multiply them, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. The term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero is the constant term, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that's the answer.\n\nWait, let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\), and we need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiplying it by the constant term (c^0) from the second expansion. The constant term in the second expansion is 20, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6, so 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), right? Because \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) would be \\(a^2b^2\\) when \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is for the \\(c\\) terms? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the \\(c\\) part is multiplied by the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) part can be anything because when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion. But wait, actually, no. Because when we multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which suggests it's looking for a numerical coefficient, implying that maybe the \\(c\\) terms are supposed to be considered as well, but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a single number. Hmm, maybe I need to re-express the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the problem is to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense as a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term (i.e., the term where \\(c^0\\)) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term from the \\(c\\) expansion. Let me check that. So, if we consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, but that's not correct because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. That is, the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. That makes sense because then the coefficient would be a number, not a polynomial. So, let's proceed with that assumption. Therefore, the coefficient we're looking for is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical value. Therefore, my initial assumption that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) seems more plausible, which gives 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would be a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), so the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by evaluating the binomial coefficient when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But in this case, the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), while the first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the variables are different. That means that when you multiply the two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression should just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that I can treat the two parts separately? Because \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, so their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but the variables are separate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times something, but I'm not sure what. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every possible term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would contribute its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but since we're not considering the \\(c\\) terms, we just need the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, is that correct?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term would have a coefficient, and since we're not considering the \\(c\\) part, we just add up all those coefficients. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of the coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\). So, plugging \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is that accurate? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply, but in this case, the variables are separate, so actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But since the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times each term in the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part? But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify the problem statement again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, when they say \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", they might be considering the entire expression, which includes terms with \\(c\\). But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term with only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so in the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various exponents \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we're only interested in the coefficient when the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not possible because in the product, each term has both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and \\(c\\) exponents. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But since \\(c\\) is in the second part, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second expansion. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms, which is not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient in the first part, ignoring the second part, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would mean that we're looking for the sum of all coefficients of terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) with coefficient 6 times the original coefficient. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we have to sum all those coefficients. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nAs I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has its own coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), that would mean that we're summing over all possible \\(k\\), so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the variable part, we can treat them separately. So, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, but since the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), maybe it's just 6 times the entire expansion, which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let's consider the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for some \\(m\\), but wait, no, because \\(m\\) can vary. Wait, no, because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so when we multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(m\\) is the index for the second expansion, and it's summed over all possible \\(m\\). Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m=0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient in the first part, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that we're summing over all possible \\(c\\) exponents. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, I think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute this. \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1 = c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). Now, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), but if I'm only interested in the coefficient as a number, then I would sum the coefficients of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which is 1 + 1 = 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 2 times 1 (from the binomial coefficient) times 2 (sum of coefficients), which is 2 * 2 = 4? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, in this small example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient as a polynomial, but in the original problem, the answer is a number, so maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is being treated as a separate polynomial, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which contradicts the problem statement asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me re-express the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the entire second part. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, but that seems unlikely because the second part is part of the product.\n\nWait, but in the small example I did earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem says \"the coefficient\", implying a numerical value, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present and the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because then we're looking for a specific term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would be the case where in the second expansion, the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when the exponent from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is the middle term, which is when the number of \\(c\\) terms equals the number of \\(1/c\\) terms. So, that would be when \\(m = 3\\), because \\(6 - m - m = 0\\) implies \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that contradicts the problem asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, but that seems odd because the second part is part of the product.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused again. Let me try to clarify. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by each term in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, resulting in a polynomial where each term is \\(6 \\times \\text{coefficient of } c^k\\) in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression includes the second part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so I'm probably misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that we're summing over all possible \\(c\\) exponents. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the small example I did earlier, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. So, in that case, the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so I must be missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. That would make sense because then we're looking for a specific term. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that seems plausible. Let me check that. In the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the number of \\(c\\) terms equals the number of \\(1/c\\) terms, which is when we choose 3 \\(c\\) terms and 3 \\(1/c\\) terms. So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that we're summing over all possible \\(c\\) exponents, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in that case, the coefficient would be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps that's what the problem is asking for. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), that would mean that I'm summing over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut in the small example, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. So, in that case, the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, but that seems odd.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so I'm probably misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem says \"the coefficient\", implying a numerical value, so perhaps it's only considering the coefficient in the first part, which is 6. But that seems unlikely because the second part is part of the product.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as I calculated earlier. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, to resolve this, let me think about how the product is structured. Each term in the product is of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - m}c^{-m}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would occur when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the exponent of \\(c\\) would be \\(6 - 2m\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). As I calculated earlier, \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n\nWait, but in the small example, when I did \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, in that case, the coefficient is a polynomial, but in the original problem, the answer is a number, so perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient as a polynomial, but the problem is presented in a way that expects a numerical answer, so perhaps it's 384.\n\nWait, I'm going to go with 384 as the coefficient, because when you multiply the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion, so the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut wait, in the small example, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2 times 2 = 4, but in reality, it's \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. So, perhaps the approach is different. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that we're summing over all possible \\(c\\) exponents, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because in the small example, the coefficient is a polynomial, but in the original problem, the answer is a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as calculated earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the problem statement again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n\nWait, but in the small example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2, so 2 * 1 = 2, but in reality, the coefficient is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, perhaps that approach is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, but that seems odd.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so I must be misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering \\(c\\), which would mean that we're only considering the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. But that seems unlikely because the second part is part of the product.\n\nWait, I'm going to stick with my earlier conclusion that the coefficient is 384, as that seems to be the logical result when considering the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a sum of coefficients equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\) (found by setting \\(c = 1\\)).\n\n3. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

    "text": " That means I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) would occur when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the expression also has the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait a second, the second part is multiplied by the first part, so the entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, when I multiply them, I'll be combining terms from both expansions. But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). That is, I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and the rest can be anything else. So, perhaps I don't need to consider the second part at all for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion by any term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the entire expression is the product of the two expansions, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the sum of all terms in the second expansion. But wait, that can't be right because the second expansion is a separate polynomial. Let me try to clarify. The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\) which, when expanded, has terms like \\(a^4, a^3b, a^2b^2, ab^3, b^4\\), each with their coefficients. The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, will have terms like \\(c^6, c^5(1/c) = c^4, c^4(1/c)^2 = c^2\\), and so on, down to \\(c^{-6}\\). Each of these terms has a coefficient as well. Now, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for example, \\(a^4\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^4c^6, a^4c^4, a^4c^2\\), etc. Similarly, \\(a^3b\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, giving terms like \\(a^3bc^6, a^3bc^4\\), etc., and so on for each term. Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find all the terms in the product that have exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, I need to collect all the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, and then sum their coefficients. But wait, how does that work? Because in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, but the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) come only from the first expansion, while the exponents of \\(c\\) come from the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then I just need to take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, which has a coefficient of 6, and multiply it by the entire second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by evaluating the polynomial at the variable equal to 1. So, for the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), if I set \\(c = 1\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems straightforward. But let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion has a coefficient of 6, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has coefficients, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we're essentially summing over all possible \\(k\\), which gives us 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), when you multiply it by any term in the second expansion, you're just scaling the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the coefficient of that term in the second expansion. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible powers of \\(c\\) is the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. Wait, but let me check if I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it's in the product of two expressions. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I expand the product, each term is of the form (term from first expansion) * (term from second expansion). So, if I'm looking for terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, then those terms come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion multiplied by any term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient for each such term would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (which is 6) multiplied by the coefficient of each term in the second expansion. But since we're interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible coefficients from the second expansion. That sum is indeed 64, as I calculated earlier by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by considering the entire expansion. Let me write out the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately and then see how they combine. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be written using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) in the second expansion go from \\(6\\) down to \\(-6\\) in steps of 2. Now, when I multiply these two expansions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, which has a coefficient of 6, is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the terms resulting from this multiplication are \\(6a^2b^2c^{6}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{4}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{2}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{0}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). Each of these terms has a coefficient of 6 multiplied by the respective binomial coefficient from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, essentially, we're being asked for the sum of all coefficients attached to \\(a^2b^2c^{k}\\) for any \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient we're looking for is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I calculated earlier, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product being equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the second expansion is a separate polynomial, its sum of coefficients is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. I think that makes sense. Let me just verify by considering a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 (from the first part) times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 2, so 1*2=2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would be 1*2=2. So, in this case, the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) would both be 2, which is correct because when you expand \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), you get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\), so the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are indeed 2 each. So, applying the same logic, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. Therefore, I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the binomial expansion of each part. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)** using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), giving the coefficient:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the sum of coefficients from the second part (64):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would mean that we're considering the entire expression, but perhaps only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are zero, so that when multiplied, they don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Or maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. \n\nWait, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are multiplied by each term, so actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, when you multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, each of which has some power of \\(c\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, but actually, no. Wait, no, because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(6 \\times \\text{coefficient of } c^k \\times a^2b^2c^k\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), that would mean that all those terms would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check another way. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, as we found. Then, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem again, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, to find the constant term, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the answer would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", not specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\)? Or is it only considering the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\)? Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. Let me re-read the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems counterintuitive because when you multiply by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively distributing the \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is the product of two polynomials. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible products where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) add up to 2 each, but since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just the coefficient from the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. So, yes, that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm with an example. Let's say I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\(a \\times (c + 1/c) + b \\times (c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also \\(c + 1/c\\). So, if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's \\(c + 1/c\\), which is 2 when \\(c = 1\\), but if I set \\(c = 1\\), then the coefficient is 2. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 2. So, by analogy, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but in my earlier thought, I considered that the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, which is it? The problem is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the exact wording: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so it's probably considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to treat the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and find the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(6c^6a^2b^2\\), \\(36c^4a^2b^2\\), etc. So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 36, and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables. But that doesn't make much sense because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so the coefficients are multiplied. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Let me first compute the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). As we did earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), with terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). Now, when we multiply these two polynomials together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient and a power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the product term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), for various \\(k\\). Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(k\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nNow, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, which is it? Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the answer would be 384. \n\nBut to be thorough, let me consider both interpretations. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. But given the way the problem is phrased, I think it's the former. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term, so that the entire term is \\(a^2b^2\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, maybe I should look for similar problems or think about how coefficients work in products of polynomials. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial can be multiplied by any term in the second polynomial, each contributing their own coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all such products, which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is only interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to treat \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, and thus the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but that's not standard. Usually, when you ask for the coefficient of a specific term, you're considering all possible combinations of other variables. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 384. \n\nBut to make sure, let me try to compute it step by step. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\): \n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nThe sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n\n\\[\n1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\n\\]\n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients is 64. \n\nNow, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) (with coefficient 6) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, each contributing their own coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. \n\nBut just to make sure, let me consider another perspective. Suppose I treat the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire second polynomial, because the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, effectively, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the correct answer is 384. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 120 if considering only the constant term. Let me just confirm that. If I were to look for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 20, giving 120. But the problem doesn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I think 384 is the correct answer. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and not consider it, but that doesn't seem right because the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me think about how coefficients work in products. When you have two polynomials, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) will have terms where each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire polynomial \\(Q(c)\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(Q(c)\\). But when you're asked for the coefficient, you're supposed to express it as a numerical coefficient, not as a polynomial. So, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the constant term in \\(Q(c)\\), which is 20, giving 120. \n\nWait, that makes sense too. Because if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you might implicitly be considering the term where the other variables (in this case, \\(c\\)) are at their lowest power, which is \\(c^0\\). So, perhaps the answer is 120. \n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me try to clarify. \n\nIn the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when you expand it, you get terms like \\(a^4c^6\\), \\(a^4c^4\\), etc., down to \\(a^4c^{-6}\\), and similarly for other terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), you're effectively summing over all possible coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second polynomial, then it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nSo, which interpretation is correct? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". In standard terminology, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, you consider the term with the specified variables and any combination of the other variables. But in this case, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient when all other variables are set to their minimal or zero power. \n\nWait, but that's not standard. Usually, if you're asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you have to specify the power of any other variables involved. Since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps it's considering the term where \\(c\\) is at its minimal power, which is \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to treat \\(c\\) as an independent variable and not consider its powers, but that doesn't make much sense because \\(c\\) is part of the expression. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 384. \n\nI think I need to make a decision here. Given that the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), and given that in standard polynomial multiplication, the coefficient of a term is a number, not a polynomial, I think the correct interpretation is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 384. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is 384. \n\nWait, but to be absolutely sure, let me consider an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, I get \\(a(c + 1/c) + b(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. But if I set \\(c = 1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2. Similarly, in the original problem, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 2^6 = (a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, by substituting \\(c = 1\\), we can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64 (found by setting \\(c = 1\\)). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, that part is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to expand that as well. But wait, the problem is asking only for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they are multiplied by the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But wait, no, the entire expression is a product of two binomials. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might need to consider how the multiplication affects the coefficients. Wait, actually, no. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part. So, when I multiply them together, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms won't interact with the \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the entire second part, since \\(c\\) terms don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded as \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expanded as some terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), then when I multiply them, each term in the first will be multiplied by each term in the second. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then that's it because the second part is just a constant when considering only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because the second part isn't a constant; it's another binomial expansion. So, actually, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, because otherwise, it's not a single term. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have to be multiplied by a term from the second part that has \\(c^0\\), which is just a constant. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). That makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the product of the two coefficients: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. Now, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's apply the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120. I think that's correct. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c^0\\) from the second part. Since \\(c^0\\) is just 1, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) because \\(4 - k = 2\\) when \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait a second, so does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6? Because the other part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents won't interfere with each other. That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), does that mean I'm just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? Or is there a specific term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that I need to consider? Hmm, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\), so I think it means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not just a number. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two expressions together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by some power of \\(c\\), you might get terms where \\(c\\) is to the zero power, i.e., 1. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, it doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I'm supposed to consider all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient when considering all terms, so effectively, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that would just be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which again is a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a typo, and it's supposed to be \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) or something like that. But since that's not the case, I have to go with what's given. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because usually, when they ask for a coefficient, they mean a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, and all terms are combined. But in that case, the coefficient would be multiplied by all possible terms from the second part, which would involve various powers of \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, you get a product of two polynomials. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of the first part, and it's multiplied by every term from the expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is probably not what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire expression. That makes more sense because then the coefficient would be a number. Let me proceed under that assumption. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That seems plausible. Let me check: in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) would be the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel each other out. So, when you expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 and the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient we're looking for is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire expression is 120. But wait, the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if I'm correct, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because coefficients are usually numbers, not polynomials. Alternatively, maybe the problem is in two variables, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) is a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But I think the problem is more likely expecting a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient when considering all powers of \\(c\\), but that doesn't make sense because then it would be an infinite series. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial. But I think the intended answer is 120, assuming that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and ignoring \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely because \\(c\\) is part of the expression. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems too complicated for the problem. Therefore, I think the problem must have intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c)^4\\), but that's just a guess. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, since the problem likely seeks the coefficient when considering the constant term in \\(c\\), we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Now, the expression also has another part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this part as well. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I need to multiply the coefficients together? Hmm, let me think.

So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as in the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? Wait, that doesn't sound right. Or perhaps, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. But that doesn't seem quite right either. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expression, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not a polynomial. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the expression is the product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply the two polynomials, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, each of which has some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient we're looking for is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that each term in the product will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each of those terms will have different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we can consider all those terms together. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and not considering the second part. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is the product of both parts. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the final answer should be 384. But let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the entire expression as a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct because the second part isn't a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, each of which has a coefficient and a power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then all those terms contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), each multiplied by their respective coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) would be present, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so effectively, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). Wait, no, in the product, each term would be something like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{-m}\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is the same as in the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is from the second part when it's multiplied? Wait, no, actually, I think I might be confusing something here. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) (which is \\(c^{-1}\\)) are zero. Because if the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, then that term is just a constant, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me clarify: to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all terms in the expansion where the power of \\(a\\) is 2, the power of \\(b\\) is 2, and the power of \\(c\\) is 0. Because any other power of \\(c\\) would mean that the term isn't just a constant, but would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want in this case. So, how do I approach this? Let me break it down. First, as before, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), because when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's apply the binomial theorem again to this part. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these two terms together, the coefficient becomes \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the product of the two coefficients, which is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2.

    "text": " That means I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, let me find that term. In the expansion, when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{4 - 2}b^2 = \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\). Calculating the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how that affects the coefficient. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it seems like the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, right? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical, not expressions. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the other variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is part of a larger expression where both \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) are involved, but in this case, the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand the entire expression, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number, which doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just 6, because the other part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the entire second expression, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just 6 times whatever the second expression is, but that doesn't make sense because coefficients are numbers. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, meaning that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider the entire expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, and the second part is separate, the coefficient is just 6. Wait, but let me check that again. Let me consider the entire product. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that is 6 times each term from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical, not expressions. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the entire expression is a product, but the \\(c\\) terms are separate. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are part of the other factors, but the problem is only concerned with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part. So, maybe the answer is 6. But wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider the entire expansion and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would indeed be 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. So, I think the answer is 6. But wait, let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numbers. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is 6, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem.

So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider both parts together. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, does that mean I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe I can just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then, since the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by it, perhaps I need to consider if there are any terms in the second part that would affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part. So, maybe the coefficient is just 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), which don't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because any term in the second part would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But wait, no, because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that as well using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), the product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think I need to sum all the coefficients from the second part because each term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Because in the product, each term is a combination of a term from the first part and a term from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, does that mean that the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part? Or is it more nuanced? Let me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are all the terms of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each of those terms has a coefficient, and when multiplied by 6, they become part of the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times the respective \\(c\\) term. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent, I think I need to sum all those contributions. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first part and the second part is only in terms of \\(c\\), which doesn't interfere with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), then every term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yes, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being 6, and the second part contributes a factor of 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to approach this is to consider that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that makes sense. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then I would have to find the corresponding term in the second part. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), I have to consider all possible \\(c\\) terms that come along with \\(a^2b^2\\), which means summing all coefficients from the second part. \n\nSo, to recap: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that's the correct approach. Let me just verify with a small example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Expanding, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which matches. So, this seems to work. \n\nAnother example: \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). Coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) is \\(\\dbinom{2}{1} = 2\\). Sum of coefficients in the second part is \\((1 + 1)^2 = 4\\). So, total coefficient would be 2 * 4 = 8. Expanding, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). Multiplying, the term \\(2ab\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so \\(2ab c^2 + 4ab + 2ab / c^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 4, which is 2 * 4 = 8. Wait, but in this case, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 4, which is 2 * 2, but the sum of coefficients in the second part is 4, so 2 * 4 = 8. Wait, but in the expansion, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 4, not 8. Hmm, that seems contradictory. \n\nWait, perhaps my approach is wrong. Let me check. In the product \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^2\\), the term \\(ab\\) is multiplied by each term in \\((c + 1/c)^2\\), which are \\(c^2\\), \\(2\\), and \\(1/c^2\\). So, the coefficients for \\(ab\\) in the product would be \\(2ab \\times c^2\\), \\(2ab \\times 2\\), and \\(2ab \\times 1/c^2\\). So, the coefficients are \\(2c^2\\), \\(4\\), and \\(2/c^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) without any \\(c\\) terms would be 4, which is 2 (from the first part) multiplied by 2 (the coefficient of the constant term in the second part). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 4, not 8. So, my previous approach was wrong. So, what's the mistake here? \n\nAh, I see. The sum of all coefficients in the second part is 4, but when you multiply by the coefficient of \\(ab\\), which is 2, you get 8. But in reality, only the constant term in the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(ab\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. The other terms (with \\(c^2\\) and \\(1/c^2\\)) contribute to terms with \\(ab c^2\\) and \\(ab / c^2\\), which are different terms. So, in the original problem, if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent, then we need to sum all coefficients from the second part because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term \\(a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\), but the problem doesn't specify any restriction on \\(c\\), so all those terms are included. Wait, but in the example, the problem would have been to find the coefficient of \\(ab\\), and the answer would have been 4, which is 2 (from the first part) times 2 (the coefficient of the constant term in the second part). So, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But in the example, that would give 2 * 4 = 8, but the actual coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 4. So, there's a contradiction. \n\nWait, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read it. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, all terms in the expansion that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes to a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). So, in the example, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the first part (which is 2) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part (which is 4), giving 8. But when I actually expanded it, I saw that the coefficient of \\(ab\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is 4, but if I consider all terms with \\(ab\\), including those with \\(c^2\\) and \\(1/c^2\\), then the coefficients are 2, 4, and 2, which sum to 8. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), which would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut in the example, if I asked for the coefficient of \\(ab\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it would be 8, which is 2 * 4. But when I expanded, I saw that the terms with \\(ab c^2\\), \\(ab\\), and \\(ab / c^2\\) have coefficients 2, 4, and 2, respectively, which sum to 8. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) without any restriction on \\(c\\) is indeed 8. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but in the example, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 4, and the coefficient in the first part is 2, so 2 * 4 = 8, which matches. So, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me make sure. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when I multiply these two, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6 * 1 = 6. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6 * 6 = 36. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 6 * 15 = 90. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (with \\(c^0\\)) is 6 * 20 = 120. Similarly, the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2/c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2/c^4\\), and \\(a^2b^2/c^6\\) would be 6 * 15 = 90, 6 * 6 = 36, and 6 * 1 = 6, respectively. \n\nSo, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then we need to sum all these coefficients: 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6. Let's add them up: \n\n6 + 36 = 42\n\n42 + 90 = 132\n\n132 + 120 = 252\n\n252 + 90 = 342\n\n342 + 36 = 378\n\n378 + 6 = 384\n\nSo, the total coefficient is 384. That matches the earlier calculation of 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, since the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, as calculated by setting \\(c = 1\\), then 6 * 64 = 384. So, that's another way to see it. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean I just need the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by whatever is the coefficient from the second part when considering the terms that don't involve \\(c\\)?

Let me think. \n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes to a different term in the final expansion, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the total coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, meaning that we can ignore the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Wait, but that might not be the case because the entire expression is a product of two parts, so the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But since the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which can be expanded, but when you multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the second part adds a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nWait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Because the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, each term in the expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). When you multiply this by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then we need to sum all the coefficients from the second part because each term contributes to a different term in the final expansion. So, the total coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) times 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6*64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be the sum of all those coefficients. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, but perhaps the second part is independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6*64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so each term is a product of powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). But the problem specifically says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any power of \\(c\\), which suggests that it's asking for the sum of all coefficients where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, that would indeed be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nBut let me confirm this approach. Let's consider a simpler example. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that's not helpful. Let me take another example. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^0 = (a + b)^2 \\times 1\\). Then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because it's only \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). Wait, that's not helpful either. Maybe another example: \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part (which is 1) times the sum of coefficients in the second part (which is 2, since \\(c + 1/c\\) has coefficients 1 and 1). So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 1*2=2. But in reality, when you expand, you get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the term \\(ab\\) doesn't exist; instead, each term is a product of a and c, a and 1/c, etc. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is zero because there's no such term. Hmm, so maybe my initial approach is incorrect. \n\nWait, that suggests that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be zero because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that can't be right because in the problem, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384. But in my earlier example, that approach gave an incorrect result because the coefficient was zero, but according to that approach, it would have been 1*2=2, which was wrong. So, perhaps my approach is wrong. \n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because in the first example, \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is zero, but according to the approach of multiplying the coefficients, it would have been 1*2=2, which is incorrect. Therefore, my initial approach is flawed. \n\nSo, perhaps I need to reconsider. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that we need to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would indeed be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part contributes to a different term in the final expansion. \n\nWait, but in my earlier example, that approach gave the wrong answer, so perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. When you have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), their expansions are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\). So, if we're summing over all possible \\(k\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nBut in my earlier example, \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no such term. But according to this approach, it would be 1 (coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second part), which is 2, but in reality, there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, perhaps my approach is incorrect. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that in the first example, the exponent on \\(a + b\\) is 1, so the maximum exponent for \\(a\\) is 1, so \\(a^2b^2\\) can't exist. Therefore, in that case, the coefficient is zero. But in the given problem, the exponent is 4, so \\(a^2b^2\\) is possible. So, perhaps my approach works when the exponents allow for the term in question. \n\nWait, but in the problem, we have \\((a + b)^4\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) is a valid term, and its coefficient is 6. Then, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6*6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), would be the sum of all these coefficients. That is, 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check this with a smaller exponent to see if it makes sense. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no such term. But according to the approach, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is zero because the exponent is 2, and \\(a^2b^2\\) would require exponents 2 each, which is possible only if the exponent is at least 4. Wait, no, in \\((a + b)^2\\), the maximum exponent for \\(a\\) is 2, so \\(a^2b^0\\) and \\(a^1b^1\\), \\(a^0b^2\\). So, \\(a^2b^2\\) is not present, hence the coefficient is zero. So, in that case, the approach would correctly give zero because the coefficient from the first part is zero. \n\nAnother example: \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from the first part) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second part), giving 12. Let's see: expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, multiplying by \\((c + 1/c)\\), each term in the first part is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6c + 6*(1/c). So, the coefficient is 6 times (1 + 1) = 12. So, in this case, the approach works. \n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term in the second part. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that's a different interpretation. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). \n\nWait, I need to clarify this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that we need to consider all terms in the expansion where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is raised to any power. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nBut in that case, as I thought earlier, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second part, then multiply them. But since it's not specified, I think the intended interpretation is that we're summing over all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another example. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is zero because in \\((a + b)^2\\), the highest power of \\(a\\) is 2, but \\(a^2b^2\\) would require \\(a^2b^2\\), which is not present. So, the coefficient is zero. Alternatively, if we have \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 6*(1 + 2 + 1)=6*4=24. \n\nBut wait, when you expand \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6*(1 + 2 + 1) = 24. So, that seems correct. \n\nTherefore, going back, in the original problem, the coefficient is 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power. In that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiply them. \n\nSo, let's explore this possibility. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6*20=120. \n\nBut the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't mention \\(c\\) at all, so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean summing over all possible coefficients from the second part, giving 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all variables, which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But that seems unlikely because usually, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term with multiple variables, it's considering the entire monomial, including all variables. So, if it's asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), it's probably considering the term without any \\(c\\) component, i.e., \\(c^0\\). \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. \n\nWait, but let's think about the structure of the problem. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, I think. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by \\(c^m\\) for various \\(m\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), which suggests that it's considering all possible \\(m\\). So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384. \n\nBut to be thorough, let me calculate the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, setting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the answer would be 6*20=120. But since it's not specified, I think the intended answer is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check one more time. Let's consider the expansion: \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of all coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64. So, when you multiply 6 by 64, you get 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. \n\nI think that makes sense now. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would happen when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, so when I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it's going to produce terms involving \\(c\\) raised to various powers. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient might just be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that can't be right because the second part is raised to the 6th power, so it's a sum of terms. Maybe I need to consider how the two expansions interact. Wait, actually, the entire expression is a product of two expansions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think that any term from the second expansion that includes \\(c\\) will result in a term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want. So, the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is if the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, in the second expansion, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me think about that. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. Let me write that out: \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of the two expansions, we need to multiply the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and from the second part, it's 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the first expansion gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second expansion gives a constant term (with respect to \\(c\\)) of 20. So when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply when taking the product of the terms. So, yeah, I think 120 is the right answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), gives a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) with coefficient 20. Multiplying these together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that seems solid. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2.

So, I need to consider the expansion of both parts and then find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part, when we multiply the two expansions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (since \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) would not affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product) in the second part. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. If I have two polynomials, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then when I multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(Q(c)\\). So, yes, I think that's right. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which we found to be 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, now I need to expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). I need to find the term where the exponent is 0, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that seems correct. Alternatively, I know that \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20 because 6 choose 3 is a standard binomial coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two expansions, and when looking for a specific term, you only consider the terms from each expansion that contribute to that term. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, their coefficients multiply. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient should be 120. \n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can compute the entire product up to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and see. But that might take too long, but perhaps I can compute the first few terms. \n\nWait, another approach: the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, as I thought earlier. \n\nSo, yeah, I think 120 is the correct coefficient. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which term corresponds to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Well, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, in the binomial expansion, \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), so when \\(4 - k = 2\\), that means \\(k = 2\\). So, the term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Let me calculate that coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, because 4 choose 2 is 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that this part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so it's separate. So, when we multiply the two parts together, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that means we don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply only when the variables match. But in this case, since \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when we multiply it by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider only the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that result in a constant term when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, actually, no. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the result will be a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), etc. But the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that the term should not have any \\(c\\) in it. So, that means we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will give a term \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is 6, and from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term of 20. When we multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in \\(20a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 20 * 6 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. Since the two parts are multiplied together, the entire expression is the product of two separate expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) add up to 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) add up to zero. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which is 6, and from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we take the constant term, which is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. That makes sense.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the constant term. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: when you have \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the exponents of \\(c\\) will be even numbers because each term in the expansion is \\(c^{6 - m} * c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponents go from 6 down to -6 in steps of 2. So, the constant term is when the exponent is 0, which is at \\(m = 3\\). So, yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, is there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by something from the second expansion? Let me think. Since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it can't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, only the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion, when multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, will result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that's the only contribution. So, 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nI think that's it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term corresponding to \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\nThe constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nMultiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Wait, but actually, no, because the entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), any term in the second expansion that doesn't affect \\(a^2b^2\\) would just multiply the coefficient.

So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6, as calculated earlier, multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion isn't a single term. Wait, I'm confused now.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the entire expression is a product, so when you expand it, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). So, that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so we need to find all terms where \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\), which means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before. So, for each such term, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent, I think we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) the coefficients \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because each \\(m\\) will contribute to a different term in the product.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion isn't a single coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify \\(k\\). Hmm, perhaps I need to re-read the problem.\n\nThe problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the terms in the second expansion, which isn't a single coefficient. Wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that seems odd because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. When you multiply two expressions together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in each expression that multiply together to give that specific term. So, in this case, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expression and multiply it by every term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression multiplied by the entire second expression. But that's not correct because the second expression isn't a single term. Wait, no, actually, each term in the product is a term from the first expression times a term from the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expression. Because each term in the second expression, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems a bit strange, but let me check.\n\nWait, let me think about it this way. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). The product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the entire Q(c), because every term in Q(c) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b)) * Q(c). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in c, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by terms in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that the term is a constant term. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense because then the coefficient would be a numerical value.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make the problem well-defined. So, let me proceed under that assumption. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as calculated earlier. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) if we're only considering the constant term with respect to \\(c\\).\n\nSo, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part), which equals 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), has a coefficient of 20 for \\(c^0\\). Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which isn't a single number, so that can't be right. Therefore, it's more reasonable to assume that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating again. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It just says \\(a^2b^2\\), without mentioning \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but only considering the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make the coefficient a numerical value, which is 120, as calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1)^6\\), but that's just a guess. But given the problem as stated, I think the most reasonable interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Suppose I don't consider the \\(c\\) terms at all. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to a sum of terms involving various powers of \\(c\\), each term in the product would be of the form 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, it's likely that they want the coefficient when considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, after considering all possibilities, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would happen when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\).

Okay, so the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the expression also has a second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this part interacts with the first part. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, does that mean I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part? Or maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply as well. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient, not an expression. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, I see. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first part, and since the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by the second part, each term in the first part gets multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), it would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the terms in the second part. Wait, no, that can't be right because the second part is raised to the 6th power, which would have multiple terms. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently. Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient remains the same as in the first part, because when you multiply by the second expansion, which has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps we're considering the coefficient as part of the entire expression. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that implies that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expansion. Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, first, we found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again to the second part. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, but since the entire expression includes terms with \\(c\\), perhaps I'm supposed to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that's multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients from each part, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that it's just the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part has multiple terms. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify the question again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire expression, which is a product of two polynomials, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{-m}\\), depending on how the exponents work out. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that in the entire product, all the terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But wait, that's not possible because in the product, each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and \\(c\\) exponents. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\), and that's the only term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents match. So, as I calculated earlier, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and from the second part, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that makes sense. Let me just double-check my calculations. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering each part separately. \n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   The term with \\(c^0\\) (since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\)) occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0.

Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but wait a second. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The other part of the expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient we found from the first part, multiplied by the entire second part? Or do I need to consider how the second part affects it? Let me think. The expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. That means when we multiply out the entire expression, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by all the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not involving \\(c\\), that would mean we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which doesn't affect the variables. Alternatively, maybe it's considering all possible coefficients, but I think it's more likely that the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not involving \\(c\\), that might mean we're looking for the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it won't be just \\(a^2b^2\\); it'll have those \\(c\\) terms attached. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. That makes sense because when you multiply, the \\(c^0\\) term won't add any \\(c\\) terms, so the product term will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant. So, let me check that. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) => \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply the two expressions together, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But wait, no, that's not right. Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by, say, \\(c^k\\), then the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when it's multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, which is \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct approach. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all possible ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be formed by multiplying terms from each part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part only involves \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part. So, that's why the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Let me double-check my calculations. For the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That's correct. For the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. As I calculated, \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right.
