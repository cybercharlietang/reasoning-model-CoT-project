    "text": " So, I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, but when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. However, since the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), the terms in the second expression don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, actually, the way the problem is worded, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only appear in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) only appear in the second part, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I expand the entire expression, each term will be of the form \\((a^kb^{4 - k}) \\times (c^m c^{-(6 - m)})\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire sum of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because the problem is asking for a single coefficient, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I misinterpreted the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product as a single expression, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But that would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem asks for the coefficient, so maybe it's expecting a numerical coefficient, which would imply that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some expression in \\(c\\), and perhaps we're supposed to find the coefficient as a number, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make much sense because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check that again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem just asks for the coefficient, so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, maybe I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term, and then multiply that by 6. Let me check that. \n\nSo, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, that seems more plausible. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term in the \\(c\\) part. So, the coefficient would be 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion), giving 120. \n\nLet me verify that again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). So, for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, we have \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient from the first part is 6. Then, the term from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we need to consider all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. That would make more sense. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, as calculated before. So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify the problem statement again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, in the entire product, we're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). For example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\right)\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a bit ambiguous. It could either be asking for the entire coefficient as a polynomial, or perhaps it's asking for the constant term in that coefficient, i.e., the coefficient when all variables are considered, but that's not standard. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) occurs, which would be the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term from the second part. That would make sense, and the answer would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nLet me see if that makes sense. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. So, when we multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would have a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer is 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think again: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial for the respective terms that multiply to give that term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the term \\(c^0\\) comes only from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is formed by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by \\(c^0\\) from the second. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), that would be different, but since it just says \\(a^2b^2\\), it's ambiguous. However, given the structure of the problem, it's more likely that they want the coefficient when considering only the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), gives \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. Multiplying these together gives the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) with coefficient 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product as \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " That means I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs in this expansion. So, in the term \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), I want \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check: if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). Perfect, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I wonder if I need to consider the terms from this part as well. Wait, but the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, does that mean the coefficient is just 6? Or do I need to consider the entire expression? Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient remains 6 regardless of the other terms. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me try to write out the expansion more carefully. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. Let me compute that. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I'm essentially taking each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion. But the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I need to consider all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\)? Or is it just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, I think it's the latter. The problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, you're distributing each term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite accurate. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). When we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the product multiplied by each power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without considering \\(c\\), would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. But in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^l c^m\\) or something like that. So, unless \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would only appear if there's a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6. That would give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Let me check that logic again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2. When multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when I multiply 6a^2b^2 by each term, I get terms like 6\\dbinom{6}{m}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion. But wait, no, that's not quite right because each term in the product is a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be when you take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by each term from the second part, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, unless we're considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term, regardless of the \\(c\\) part, the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term, and when multiplied by \\(c\\) terms, it becomes a term with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, unless the problem is considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the other part, which is 64, giving 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the intended interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and ignoring the other part because it's multiplied by other terms. But that doesn't seem right either because the entire expression is the product of both. Maybe I need to clarify the problem statement. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\). In the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^l c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^l c^{-m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be present if there is a term in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Because if the exponent of \\(c\\) is non-zero, then the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^m\\), which is different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That means we need to consider only the term where \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, let's find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that gives \\(c^0\\). Using the binomial expansion, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We set the exponent equal to 0: \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the term \\(20\\) in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120. Let me double-check. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6a^2b^2. The term that gives \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. So, when you multiply 6a^2b^2 by 20, you get 120a^2b^2. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. That seems correct. So, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (\\(c^0\\)) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n   \\]\n   Thus, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients found:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), right? Because \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) needs to be \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, that part is clear. The coefficient is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but I'm only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all? Hmm, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, each term in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that would mean I only need to consider the term from the first expansion that gives \\(a^2b^2\\), and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, but since the second part is being multiplied by the first, and \\(a^2b^2\\) is already present, I think the coefficient will just be 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second expansion for the constant term. Wait, because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term from the second expansion, say \\(c^k \\cdot (1/c)^{6 - k}\\), which is \\(c^{2k - 6}\\), but I don't think that affects the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient unless the second expansion's term is a constant. Because if I'm just looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), then the other part must contribute a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), right? Otherwise, the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), but not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That way, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 1 (the constant term), I get \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me focus on expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot (1/c)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that can't be right because 6! is 720, and 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) is 720/(6\u00d76) which is 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the term in the second expansion that's a constant is 20. So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20 from the second part, giving me \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives me 20 for \\(c^0\\). So, when I multiply these, the coefficient becomes 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. That seems right. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as the product of two independent expansions, so when you multiply them, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so the product's coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't think I need to consider any other terms because other terms from the second expansion would involve powers of \\(c\\), which would make the term not just \\(a^2b^2\\) but also multiplied by some \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which isn't part of the term we're looking for. So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\), right? Because \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\) implies that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, solving \\(4 - k = 2\\) gives \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms when multiplied. Wait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, it's just a constant factor for each term in the first expansion. So, perhaps the coefficient from the second part will just multiply the coefficient from the first part.\n\nWait, let me think again. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the expansion is a multiple of some power of \\(c\\). But since the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when we multiply them together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term will have a different power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a specific power of \\(c\\), not a constant. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, no. Actually, when you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients from each expression where the variables multiply to give the desired term. But in this case, the term we're looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\), and since the second expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, all the terms in the second expression are constants with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might make sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term in \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for different \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms. So, when you write the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part), which would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), but since the problem just mentions \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering all possible \\(k\\), so the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, but no, because each term in the product will have a specific \\(c\\) power. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't a single coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm this with a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\). So, if we treat \\(c\\) as another variable, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since the problem only mentions \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that we need to sum over all possible \\(k\\) the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the coefficient of a specific term in P(a, b) multiplied by Q(c) is just the coefficient in P(a, b) times the entire Q(c). So, for example, if I have P(a, b) = a^2b^2 + ... and Q(c) = c^6 + ... , then P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms like a^2b^2c^6, a^2b^2c^4, etc. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product would be the same as the coefficient of a^2b^2 in P(a, b) multiplied by the entire Q(c). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in c, not a constant. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's considering the coefficient as a polynomial, in which case the coefficient of a^2b^2 is 6 * \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6. But that seems odd because the problem might be expecting a numerical coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2c^0, i.e., the term where the power of c is zero. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in c, which might not be what the problem is asking for. So, if that's the case, then we need to find the coefficient of a^2b^2c^0 in the product. That would require a different approach.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because usually, when a problem asks for a coefficient, it's expecting a numerical value unless specified otherwise.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by each coefficient in the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion, but that would make it a sum of terms, not a single coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nBut let me verify this another way. Let's consider that \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when we multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) (which is 6) multiplied by each coefficient in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the sum of all these products. That is, 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I found earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then we would have to find the corresponding term. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the intended answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this once more. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we first determine the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), yielding \\(2^6 = 64\\). \n\nMultiplying these results gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression: \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, the coefficient for that term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just part of the first part, and then the entire expansion is multiplied by the second part. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Wait, no, actually, I think I might be misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, I think that means I need to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving powers of \\(c\\), but the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is only in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all possible terms from the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part, right? Because when you multiply by the second part, you're essentially scaling each term in the first part by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, for example, if you have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^5 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c} + 15c^4 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 20c^3 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^3} + 15c^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^4} + 6c \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^5} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in the first will be multiplied by each term in the second. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^5 + 15c^4 + 20c^3 + 15c^2 + 6c + 1\\right)\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the way it's written, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the entire product, the variables are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) is just part of the term. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that seems odd because in the product, each term will have \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) raised to some powers and \\(c\\) raised to some other powers. So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean summing over all the coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit strange. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) is in the second part, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but considering that the entire expression is a product, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because in the product, each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) raised to some powers and \\(c\\) raised to some other powers. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is just 1. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product. That makes more sense. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we need to consider the terms in the product where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, which means the term is just a constant. So, to get \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we need to find the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that has \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Then, the coefficient would be the product of these two coefficients. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already determined is 6. Next, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the answer should be 120. Let me double-check that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20, so multiplying them gives 120.

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would correspond to when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). Okay, so that part is 6.\n\nNow, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider both parts together. Wait, but the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe I can just consider the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and then see if the second part affects it. But wait, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think: when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can consider that any term from the second expression that doesn't involve \\(c\\) will just multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But wait, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is the constant term, right? Because all other terms will have some power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I can find that, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 multiplied by that constant term.\n\nSo, let me try to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nWait, so that means when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Hmm, that seems straightforward. Let me just check if I missed anything. The problem is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), so I don't need to worry about cross terms involving \\(c\\). Also, I correctly found the constant term in the second part. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you have two independent expressions multiplied together, the coefficients multiply as well. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient for \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) is 20. So, when you multiply the two expressions, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\) is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think I did that right.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem and found that the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, I considered the second part \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and found that the constant term is 20. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I can multiply the two coefficients together, resulting in 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The binomial coefficients were calculated correctly, and the logic about how the terms multiply makes sense. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). This coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply only if you're looking for a specific term. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and it gets multiplied by every term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't seem right because the expansion of the second part has multiple terms. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, that might not be correct either. Because when you multiply by each term, the variables are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so it's not a scalar. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) would have coefficients involving \\(c\\) terms, which contradicts the idea that we're just looking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^l \\times c^m \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}^n\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate, the coefficient would indeed be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the second part is a separate polynomial. Let me try to clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term from the second part is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that's not correct because the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might just be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's just 6, but that seems too simple. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so when you multiply two polynomials, each term's coefficient is multiplied by the corresponding term in the other polynomial. But in this case, since we're looking for a specific term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which contradicts the idea of a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, which would be 6. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the second part. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible terms, but that would require more work. Wait, perhaps I should treat the entire expression as a product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, making the total coefficient 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too straightforward, and the problem includes both parts, so perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try to think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the term where \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\), which implies that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each \\(m\\) in the second part, we have a term \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient will be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the product is multiplied together, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that must be the answer. Wait, but let me double-check. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. The second part, when expanded, has terms with coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each \\(m\\), and since we're multiplying each of these by 6, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. Therefore, 6 times 64 is indeed 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), whose sum of coefficients is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second.

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem probably expects a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me check: the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), setting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\).

Wait, but that can't be right because the entire product would have terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

Let me clarify: when you have two separate expressions multiplied together, like \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient in \\(P(a, b)\\) because \\(Q(c)\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and then the entire \\(Q(c)\\) is multiplied by that. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient in the first part, ignoring the second part, but that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of the second part, but that would result in a polynomial, not a single number. I'm getting confused here. Let me try another approach. Let me expand both parts separately and then see how they multiply. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has the expansion: \\[\na^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\] So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), can be expanded using the binomial theorem as: \\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\] So, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Now, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 c^{6}\\), \\(6a^2b^2 c^{4}\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). However, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the entire expansion of the second part, scaled by 6. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Therefore, I must be misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would still result in the coefficient being a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is the product of both parts. Wait, but in the product, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is asking for a single coefficient, perhaps it's considering the constant term in the second expansion. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let's find that term. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting the exponent equal to zero: \\(6 - 2k = 0 \\Rightarrow k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the constant term in the second expansion, would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a distraction. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is the product. Wait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part. But that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is a misprint, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something similar, but that's just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just there to test if I'm paying attention. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that would result in the coefficient being a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for a single coefficient, perhaps it's considering the constant term, which is 20, so the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But I'm not sure. Wait, let me think differently: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. The sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. That seems plausible. Let me check: if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs. That would be when \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\). So, \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, so I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of these two expressions. But hold on, the second part of the product is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, the terms will involve powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how this second part affects the coefficient. Wait a second, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Because the second part is multiplied by the first part, but the terms in the second part don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe I just need to take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the sum of all terms in the second part? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the second expansion includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, actually, no, that's not correct. Because the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That would mean that in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all possible terms from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, is that right? Let me think again. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply this by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first expansion, the entire expression becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the second expansion's coefficients are the binomial coefficients, and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{k}\\), where \\(k\\) is some exponent. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But let me verify this with a different approach. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two separate expansions and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) by considering only the terms from the first expansion and ignoring the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, so 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by each coefficient in the second polynomial. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the total coefficient would be the sum of all the products of the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) and each coefficient from the second part. So, that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the second part is a separate expansion, and since it's multiplied by the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, that would make the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure that's correct. Let me think of it another way. Let me denote the first polynomial as P(a, b) = (a + b)^4, and the second as Q(c) = (c + 1/c)^6. Then, the product is P(a, b) * Q(c). So, when you expand this, each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from P will be multiplied by each term in Q, which are of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q. Because each term in Q contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\), the total coefficient would be the product of the two coefficients. Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in Q is obtained by setting c = 1, so Q(1) = (1 + 1)^6 = 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, if I were to compute the entire expansion, the coefficient would indeed be 384. So, I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me go through it again. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is obtained by substituting c = 1, which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   - Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by evaluating the binomial coefficient for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs.

But wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression. Now, I'm a bit confused. Do I need to multiply the terms from both expansions together? Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second part for the terms that don't involve \\(c\\)? Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means I need to find all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that are constants, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. Hmm, okay, so let me work on expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 120. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives 20. So, when we multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the constant term 20, resulting in 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, the coefficient should be 120.

Now, the expression we're dealing with is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers. Now, when we multiply two expressions, the terms combine.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\) times something else. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part, the product will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m (1/c)^{6 - m}\\) for various \\(k\\) and \\(m\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the first part of the product, and the second part will contribute a factor that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, so maybe the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that can't be right because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times something, but without any constraints on \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting us to consider the entire expression and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part would contribute a factor that's separate. Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting us to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is phrased as asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think again: the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m (1/c)^{6 - m}\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times\\) the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem to fit the question's wording. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would be 6 times \\(2^6\\) since each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has coefficients that are sums of binomial coefficients. Wait, no, actually, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).

Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating all variables as separate. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the second part contributes a factor that's multiplied by it. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all terms in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that sum is 2^6 = 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\), then perhaps it's just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is phrased as asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, let me try that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as before. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(c^0\\) occurs when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel each other out. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{m} \\times (1/c)^{6 - m} = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{2m - 6}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(2m - 6 = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we multiply the coefficients from both parts: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. So, I think the correct approach is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 20, so the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of these two expressions. Wait, but actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply them together, the variables involved are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(1\\) (i.e., the constant term) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. So, I think that's the approach. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from the constant term) equals 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives me 20 for the constant term, so when I multiply the two expressions together, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. Another way to think about this is that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions. So, when you multiply them, the coefficients multiply as well. So, yes, that should be correct. So, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

Wait, no, actually, no. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms will have some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\).

Wait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But that seems too big.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term will be of the form (coefficient from first expansion) \u00d7 (coefficient from second expansion) \u00d7 a^{something} b^{something} c^{something}. But we're only interested in the terms where a^2b^2 occurs, regardless of the power of c. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the entire product will be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.

But the problem didn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be different. But it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. The entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

But that seems contradictory to the way the problem is phrased.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6, because the other part is multiplied by terms that don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're just looking for the coefficient, not considering the \\(c\\) terms, it's 6.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about it differently. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiply it by any term from the second polynomial, because the second polynomial doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut let me check again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, when I multiply these two, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2/c^2 + 36a^2b^2/c^4 + 6a^2b^2/c^6\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (regardless of the power of \\(c\\)) is the sum of all coefficients attached to \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6 = 384. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be 120, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 384.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is intended to have the second part not affecting the coefficient, so perhaps the answer is 6. But from the expansion, it's clear that the coefficient is 384. So, I think 384 is correct.\n\nWait, let me confirm. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. When multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), the result is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

Since the general term is \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), setting \\(4 - k = 2\\) gives \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

So, I think that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, why \\(c^0\\)? Because when we multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think we don't need to consider any \\(c\\) terms, so we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is the constant term. Because if we have any \\(c\\) terms, like \\(c^1\\) or \\(c^{-1}\\), then the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^1\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-1}\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get the coefficient of just \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply 6 by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).

So, when we multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has some power of \\(c\\). So, the resulting expression will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean considering all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, and when multiplied by the other expansion, it becomes a sum of terms with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, perhaps the question is misworded, or maybe I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would actually be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) because the other part is multiplied by 1 (since it's a separate variable). Wait, that doesn't make sense either.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single coefficient. Therefore, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit strange because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Because if we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the entire expression when \\(c = 1\\) would be \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in that would be 6 * 64 = 384. But does that mean that in the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384? Hmm, that seems high, but maybe that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, but that would require considering all the terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and multiplying them by 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), that is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), multiply it by 6, and that would be the coefficient.\n\nLet me check that. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the term is \\(20c^0 = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the final answer would be 120. \n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a term \\(20c^0\\) when \\(k = 3\\). So, when we multiply these two together, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(20\\), resulting in \\(120a^2b^2c^0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. That makes sense. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nLet me recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, first, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, I considered the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and found that the term where \\(c^0\\) is present has a coefficient of 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), \\(k = 3\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct. So, that part checks out. Then, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has the term \\(6a^2b^2\\), which is also correct. So, multiplying those together, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the right answer.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. So, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where \\(c^0\\), which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) \u21d2 \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 20.\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the two coefficients:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs. That means I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). Solving \\(4 - k = 2\\), we get \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm wondering if I need to consider this part as well. Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part, maybe the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, let me think. When you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, right? Because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're adding terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient remains the same. \n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply the two expressions together, every term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part times 1, because the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), those \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, maybe I should think of it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and when you multiply by the other part, which is a series in \\(c\\), it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the product is a combination of terms from both expansions. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to write it out. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it's \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the terms where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), which we already found to be 6. But wait, in this case, since the coefficient is multiplied by the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part? That doesn't sound right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part's expansion contributes a factor that is multiplied by all terms. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. \n\nEach term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each coefficient of the second expansion. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. \n\nWait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part adds a factor that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the total coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, let me test this with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in \\((a + b)\\) is 1. The sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\) is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's see: \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The term \\(a c\\) and \\(a/c\\) both have coefficient 1, but if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's 1 + 1 = 2. So, yes, in this case, the coefficient is 2, which is 1 (from the first part) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second part). So, applying this logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Does that mean regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or specifically when \\(c\\) is to some power? Because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will actually appear multiple times with different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). So, I think it's asking for the sum of all coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). \n\nBut in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to compute it differently. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me try expanding a small part. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the expansion of the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another approach. Alternatively, I can consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial, provided that the variables multiply appropriately. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one polynomial and \\(c\\) is in the other, the variables don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the sum of coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), whose sum of coefficients is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Hmm, maybe I need to clarify: perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(2^6\\), since each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient that sums up to \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, that approach is incorrect because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, perhaps it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficients in the second part aren't all 1; they vary depending on the term. Wait, no, I think I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. But the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for some integer \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by every possible term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Let me compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when we multiply this by \\(a^2b^2\\), which has a coefficient of 6, the entire coefficient for each term \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all m from 0 to 6 of 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from m=0 to 6 is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6, but now I'm seeing that it's 384. Let me see if that makes sense. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, gives terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), etc. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, gives terms involving various powers of \\(c\\). When you multiply these two, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my reasoning. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), would be multiplied by every term in Q, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient in P times the sum of all coefficients in Q. Since Q is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients is when c=1, which is 2^6=64. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific k, then we would have to compute 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) where \\(6 - 2m = k\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 384.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part (64):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think it does because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think that term is only affected by the coefficients from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), might contribute a factor that is multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, but actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will come from the first part, and then it will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the second part is raised to the 6th power, it's a separate expansion. Wait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). So, maybe the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, that might not be right. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which includes terms with \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., down to \\(c^{-6}\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), when you multiply it by each term in the second expansion, it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that doesn't sound right because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering any \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply it by the entire second part, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes to a different term in the product, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would just be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that seems a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong, and the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient is just 6, as I found earlier, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's only contributing terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), not affecting the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but that can't be right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Hmm, maybe that's the case. Let me think again. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found. Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is being multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). How do I do that? Well, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because when you multiply by the second part, each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it's just 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me try to think differently. Maybe I can consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when you multiply by the second part, which is a separate expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient remains 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's only involving \\(c\\). That would make sense because the second part is a separate variable. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the terms involving different variables don't interfere with each other. So, in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. But wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. I'm confused now. Let me try to think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1)^2\\). What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product? Well, \\((a + b)^2\\) has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 1. Then, when multiplied by \\((c + 1)^2\\), which expands to \\(c^2 + 2c + 1\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\((c + 1)^2\\), resulting in \\(a^2b^2c^2 + 2a^2b^2c + a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 1 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times the sum of the coefficients in \\((c + 1)^2\\), which is \\(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 4. Wait, but in this example, the coefficient is 4, which is the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, that supports my earlier idea that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, in the original problem, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. That makes sense now. So, I think that's the correct approach. Let me summarize: To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, I need to multiply this by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving 2^6 = 64. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   To find the sum of all its coefficients, set \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n   This sum is 64.\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\). That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the expansion of both parts. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I don't need to expand the entire expression. Instead, I can focus on the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and realize that the other part involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will contribute a constant factor, because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. Let me think again: if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by another expression, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the other terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the variables are different, so when we multiply, the terms won't interfere with each other. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), does that mean that the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Hmm, that seems a bit confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps I can treat the two parts separately. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) is in the other, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because that would mean the coefficient is 6 times a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which would result in a term that includes \\(c\\) in it. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem only mentions \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, let me check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps it's considering the entire product, and looking for the term where the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would result in a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering the entire product, and the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has its own coefficient, and when you multiply by 6, you'd have to sum all those coefficients, which might be a bit involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, since the two parts are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a bit more work.\n\nWait, but maybe I can think of it as: when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) varies, but the coefficient for each such term would be 6 times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, since the two parts are independent, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me try to compute that sum.\n\nThe sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is obtained by substituting 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so when you multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Since we're only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach. Let me try to compute it another way to confirm.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. As I did before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that as well. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion is a sum of terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\), for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Each term has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. So, each term in the product will be of the form \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But the sum of binomial coefficients \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, again, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term is a different power of \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), each with their own coefficient. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's considering the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but since the problem is only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's effectively asking for the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Therefore, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only 6, and the other part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). But that can't be right because when you multiply by the second expression, you're scaling the coefficient by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials, say P(a,b) and Q(c), then the product P(a,b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term from P is multiplied by each term from Q. So, the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), would be multiplied by each term in Q, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2 * \\text{term from Q}\\). But if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q, because each term in Q contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a small example to make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let me see: in the expansion, the terms are \\(ac\\), \\(a/c\\), \\(bc\\), \\(b/c\\). So, the coefficients of \\(a\\) are 1 and 1, so total coefficient is 2, which is 1 * (1 + 1) = 2. Similarly for \\(b\\). So, this approach seems to work.\n\nTherefore, applying the same logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) again to make sure. The sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct. So, 6 * 64 is indeed 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part. But since the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient in the second part is effectively 1 (the multiplicative identity), but that's not the case because the second part is a polynomial, not a constant. So, perhaps that approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the second part, which is a polynomial, but since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by the second part, you're scaling the entire expression by it, so the coefficients should be scaled accordingly.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of it as the entire product being \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then the second part becomes 64, so the entire product becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since \\(c\\) is in the second part, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each contributing a coefficient. So, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the product being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient, not the term, it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with another example to confirm. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). The product would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\), which is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first part, which is 1, multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2, and the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 * 2 = 4. So, this approach works, confirming that the coefficient is indeed scaled by the sum of the coefficients in the second part.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not confusing the terms. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) is 6 * (coefficient from the second part for \\(c^k\\)). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64, multiplied by 6, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Since the two parts are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression, it must be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384.\n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " So, I'm looking for the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. That means \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\) for the exponent of \\(a\\), which would make \\(k = 2\\) because \\(4 - 2 = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6. So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but when I multiply these two expressions together, the terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the entire expansion of the second part is? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would just be 6 times whatever the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is in the second expansion because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\) from the second part. So, I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6.\n\nLet me verify that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when I multiply it by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, to get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\) from the second part, because \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, so let's work on that. The expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Let me simplify that. So, \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Since when we multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which has a coefficient of 20, so the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two polynomials. So, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only terms that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) are those where the second term is \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is exactly what I did. So, yeah, that makes sense.\n\nI think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't miss anything. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. That seems correct.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, maybe I should write out the expansions more explicitly. Let's see.\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion is:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nFor \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion is:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so the term is \\(20c^0 = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by \\(20\\) from the second expansion, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from each expansion:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
