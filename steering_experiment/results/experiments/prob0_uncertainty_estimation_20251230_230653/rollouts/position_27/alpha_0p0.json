When you have two polynomials multiplied together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the constant term (with respect to \\(c\\)), we only take the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is 20.

So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).

Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 - 2m = 0 \\Rightarrow 2m = 6 \\Rightarrow m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term (with coefficient 6) by the constant term (with coefficient 20). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the first part gives 6, the second part gives 20, and since they are multiplied together, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I consider the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I expand it, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which is 20, then the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the term where the exponent is 0 because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives the coefficient 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120. I think that's correct. But just to make sure, maybe I can think about it another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{2}b^{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(k = 2\\) and \\(m\\) such that the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which is \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Yep, that checks out. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).
