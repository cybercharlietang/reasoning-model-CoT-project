So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0 because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\).

Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me double-check that reasoning. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), because multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\) (which is 1) will give us \\(a^2b^2\\). If we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any other term involving \\(c\\), like \\(c^1\\) or \\(c^{-1}\\), it would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the \\(c^0\\) term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the total coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me think of another way to approach this. Alternatively, I could expand both expressions fully and then look for the coefficient. But that seems tedious. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum over all terms in the second expansion multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the only term that affects it is the constant term in the second expansion, which we already found as 20. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120.

So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But we only want the term where the product doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, so that's when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which we found to be 20. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply by a term, it's not the sum of coefficients, but rather each term is multiplied by the corresponding term in the other expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only contribution comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term in the second expansion. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is 6. Next, we find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these two coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can again use the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but since we only want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, that's why we take the 20 and multiply by 6. So, 6*20=120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here.
