    "text": " Let me calculate the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I think that's 6, because 4 choose 2 is 6. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient I found for \\(a^2b^2\\) gets multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Hmm, actually, no. Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second expression only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms in the second expression won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should just be a number, not another expression. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand the entire product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as in the first part, right? Wait, no, that can't be right because the second part is a separate expansion. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), because the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, when you multiply the two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), that is, the coefficient is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, and the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the coefficient is a single number, not an expression. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve summing over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some term from the second expression. But since the second expression doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expression. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But I think that's not the case. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in \\((a + b)^4\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Is that correct? Wait, but that seems high. Let me check. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, but since the second expression doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second expression. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single coefficient. That can't be right. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems plausible, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense because then we're looking for a specific term. In that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would make sense. So, let's go with that interpretation. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, we multiply the coefficients from each part: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which gives 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was under a different interpretation. So, which one is correct? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, if we're just looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times a polynomial, but that doesn't give a single coefficient. Alternatively, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. But the problem doesn't specify \\(c^0\\), so perhaps it's the former. However, in algebra, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term in a product, it's usually considering all possible combinations of the other variables. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear multiplied by every term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems counterintuitive because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something similar. But given the problem as stated, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, to summarize: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we also need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Let me check that. If \\(k = 2\\), then the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). So, the coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, let me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term is independent of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because the second part is also a sum of terms, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you'd get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the case when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, so I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. Let me work on that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the term where the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, is that correct? Wait, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720/(6\u00d76) is 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, first, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, I realized that in the entire expression, this term would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I need to find the term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), because that would be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, thus contributing to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, I correctly found that the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, so 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. Let me just double-check the binomial coefficients. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6, and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is indeed 20. So, 6 \u00d7 20 is 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient from this part is 6.\n\n2. **Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient from this part is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Now, the expression also has a second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, in the original problem, the coefficient is for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). That suggests that the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), might be multiplied by the first part, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect it? Wait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would be \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have coefficients multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, actually, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and the second part involves \\(c\\) terms. So, when you multiply these two, each term in the first part gets multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific term, not a sum. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, you're looking for all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, and then the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that seems a bit odd because the problem might just be expecting the coefficient from the first part, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the second part is separate, and the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is independent of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, that might make sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term would have a coefficient, and all those coefficients would add up when multiplied by 6. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem only mentions \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire product, and \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient would then be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But that might not be correct because in the product, each term is a product of terms from both expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because in the product, every term would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, in that case, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, so the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a separate expression, but that doesn't seem right because it's a product. Alternatively, perhaps the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), is a generating function, and we're supposed to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But let me check that again. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as I calculated earlier. So, if I multiply 6 by 64, I get 384. But let me think again: when you have two expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, the first expression is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in terms of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because the problem includes both parts. Hmm, maybe I should look at it differently. Let me consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6*1 = 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would be 6*6 = 36, and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, if that's the case, then the coefficient would be the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking because it's a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit strange because typically, when you ask for the coefficient of a term, you specify all variables. So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a separate factor. But that doesn't seem right because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, maybe the second part is a generating function, and we're supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible coefficients. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because the problem includes both parts. Wait, maybe I should think of it as a product of two separate expressions, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, and the second part is multiplied by 1, but that seems off. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and when you multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just \\(6a^2b^2\\) times the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a separate expression that doesn't affect it. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to think of it another way. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, this would be a sum of terms each of which is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, for example, \\(a^4b^0\\) times \\(c^6\\), \\(a^3b^1\\) times \\(c^4\\), etc. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the first expansion as 6a^2b^2, and then it would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6*1=6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would be 6*6=36, and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all these coefficients for different \\(k\\), which is 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64=384. So, I think that's the answer. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of the coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, their exponents in the product will be separate. That is, when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms will be products of terms from each expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might not need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when I multiply, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by a term from the second part that is \\(c^0\\), which is 1, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it. So, that would mean I just need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), and then multiply it by 6. \n\nWait, is that right? Let me think again. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by a term from the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have some power of \\(c\\), which we don't want. So, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this part. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Because sometimes when you have multiple variables, you might have to consider cross terms or something else, but in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get that term is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion with the constant term from the second expansion. So, I think my reasoning is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as two separate expansions and just taking the product of the coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, so their product is 120. Yeah, that seems right. \n\nI don't think I made any calculation errors. Let me double-check the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, which is correct. So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2.

So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), does that mean we don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)? Or do we need to consider how the multiplication affects the coefficient? Hmm, actually, I think the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes the other part. But wait, no, maybe not. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, actually, the expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. So, when you multiply them together, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, that means we only need to consider the part of the product where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, right? Because if we take a term from the first expansion, \\(a^2b^2\\), and multiply it by a term from the second expansion, say \\(c^k\\), then the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which has an exponent of \\(k\\) on \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that the exponents of \\(c\\) should be zero, meaning \\(c^0 = 1\\). Therefore, we need to find the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) in the second expansion cancel out to give \\(c^0\\). So, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) so that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\).

Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.

So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical factors, not expressions. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, and it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a very long expression. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify. Wait, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering the entire product and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems too high. Let me check that again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be written using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when we multiply this by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), we get terms of the form \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 \\times 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But in reality, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems correct, but I feel like maybe I'm missing something because the problem is presented as a single-variable problem, but it's actually involving multiple variables. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, no, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to consider only the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that the term is \\(a^2b^2\\), but that's not specified. Let me check that possibility. If we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. From earlier, the exponent is \\(6 - 2m\\), so setting that equal to zero: \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 times 20, which is 120. But the problem doesn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure if that's what is intended. Wait, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, as I thought earlier, giving 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to consider the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that the term is \\(a^2b^2\\), making the coefficient 120. Hmm, perhaps the problem is expecting the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, so that the term is \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. I think that's more likely what the problem is asking for, because otherwise, the coefficient would be a sum involving different powers of \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense in terms of a single coefficient. So, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Let me confirm that. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, multiplying by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering only the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that seems less likely because the problem is presented in a way that suggests a single numerical coefficient, not a sum. So, I think the intended answer is 120. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake. In \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), which has a coefficient of 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.

Wait, that can't be right because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient, not considering \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is a product of two expansions. So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just 6 times the entire expansion, which would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit odd because the coefficient would then be a function of \\(c\\), not a constant. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expression. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant, not involving \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power as well. So, in that case, I need to find the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That makes more sense because then the coefficient would be a constant. So, let me rephrase: I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That seems more accurate. So, in that case, I need to find the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. So, the approach would be to first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\times 1 = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is 6, and from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient is 20. So, multiplying them together, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\(20c^0\\). When we multiply these together, we get \\(6 * 20 a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each term in the product is a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient from this part is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that part doesn't involve \\(c\\), right? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times whatever the coefficient is for the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) in the second expansion. Wait, but actually, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since the second expression only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be 6 times the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that constant term, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{constant}\\), which is the term we're interested in. \n\nSo, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that all? Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120, which is the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Hmm, that makes sense because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms when multiplying. So, the answer should be 120. I don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me just recap: First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

So, I also have to consider the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, does this affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply with all the terms in the second expression. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that term is already present in the first part, and when I multiply it by the second part, which is a series in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the same as the coefficient in the first part multiplied by the entire second expression. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second expression is being multiplied, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, that would mean we have to consider the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part multiplied by the constant term (the term independent of \\(c\\)) from the second part. Because if we take any other term from the second part, it would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, making the overall term involve \\(c\\), which we don't want. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in the second part. \n\nSo, I need to find two things: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found as 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that now. \n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found. That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Since when we multiply the two expressions together, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. Therefore, the combined coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the entire expansion. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before. So, the coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, to get a term without \\(c\\), we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), as we found earlier, and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the combined coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. \n\nWait, but just to make sure I'm not making a mistake, let me consider if there's another way this could be approached. Maybe using multinomial coefficients or something else? Hmm, but I think the approach is correct because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so their coefficients are independent of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is determined entirely by the first part, and then multiplied by the constant term from the second part. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to consider the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we have to consider the part where the second expansion contributes nothing (i.e., the constant term). So, that's why we multiply the coefficients. \n\nI think I'm confident now that the coefficient is 120. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the second part of the expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them together, the variables are separate. That is, \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, so \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me think. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because then each term becomes just the coefficient. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems a bit high. Let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply, every term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second part). \n\nSo, as I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the entire expression being a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, because every term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would make the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misapplying the concept. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of its coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 2^6 = 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are zero, but that's not the case here because \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\). So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's see: \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a (1/c) + b c + b (1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) (which is \\(a^1b^0\\)) is indeed 2, because it's \\(c + 1/c\\). So, that seems correct. Similarly, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply by the second polynomial, every term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient becomes 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part, 64, giving 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give the desired term. So, in this case, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by every term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), every term in the second polynomial will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nSo, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2, so 2 * 2 = 4. But let's see: expanding, we get \\(a^2c + a^2(1/c) + 2abc + 2ab(1/c) + b^2c + b^2(1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is \\(2c + 2(1/c)\\), which is not a constant. Wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion. So, perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, that's a problem. In this example, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product isn't a constant; it's \\(2c + 2/c\\). So, that means that the coefficient of \\(ab\\) isn't just 2 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, because the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 2, but the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is \\(2c + 2/c\\), which is variable-dependent. Therefore, my initial approach was incorrect.\n\nWait, so that suggests that my earlier reasoning was wrong. So, perhaps I need to think differently. Let me try to understand this.\n\nWhen we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\), we need to consider that each term in the expansion is a product of terms from each polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. However, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire expansion of the second polynomial. But that's not correct because the coefficient of a term in a product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give the desired term.\n\nWait, but in this case, the variables are separate. So, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and when you multiply it by any term in the second polynomial, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are zero. Wait, no, that's not correct because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second polynomial, you get terms that have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only consider the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are zero. But that's not possible because \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\) are never 1 unless \\(k = 0\\). So, the only term that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when \\(k = 0\\), which is the constant term in the second polynomial.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, I think I was wrong before. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second polynomial, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, which contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) and thus wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term. So, that changes things.\n\nSo, let me correct my approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it gives a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient.\n\nSo, let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, my initial mistake was thinking that the entire sum of coefficients in the second polynomial contributes, but actually, only the constant term contributes because we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nLet me double-check this with the earlier example I had, where I considered \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the first polynomial is 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial is 1 (since \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1 = c + 1/c\\), so the constant term is 1). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product should be 2 * 1 = 2. Let's see: expanding \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), we get \\(a^2c + a^2(1/c) + 2abc + 2ab(1/c) + b^2c + b^2(1/c)\\). The terms involving \\(ab\\) are \\(2abc\\) and \\(2ab(1/c)\\), which have coefficients \\(2c\\) and \\(2/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is \\(2c + 2/c\\), which is not a constant. Wait, that contradicts my conclusion. So, perhaps I'm still misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps in that example, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is not a constant because it's being multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(ab\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, leading to terms like \\(ab \\times c\\) and \\(ab \\times 1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product is not just the product of the coefficients, but rather each term is a product of coefficients times the variables. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is \\(2c + 2/c\\), which is variable-dependent. Therefore, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(ab\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, it would only be the constant term in the coefficient, which is zero because there's no constant term in \\(2c + 2/c\\). So, that suggests that my approach of multiplying the coefficients is only valid when the variables are separate, but in reality, when variables are involved, it's more complicated.\n\nWait, but in our original problem, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, in the product, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by the constant term \\(c^0\\) from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nIn the earlier example, if I were to look for the coefficient of \\(ab\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, it would be zero because \\(2c + 2/c\\) doesn't have a constant term. So, perhaps in that case, the coefficient is zero, but in our original problem, the constant term exists, so the coefficient is 120.\n\nLet me try another example to confirm. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The first part has \\(a + b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1. The second part, \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 2. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product should be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's expand the product: \\((a + b)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2) = a c^2 + 2a + a/c^2 + b c^2 + 2b + b/c^2\\). The term \\(2a\\) is present, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 2, which matches our calculation. So, that works.\n\nSimilarly, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120, which should be correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with the example where the coefficient is zero. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part is 1. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is zero because \\((c + 1/c)\\) doesn't have a constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product should be 1 * 0 = 0. Let's expand it: \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). There is no term with just \\(a\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed zero, which aligns with our calculation.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. In the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in a term \\(6 * 20 a^2b^2 = 120 a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nI think that makes sense now. So, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), giving \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Let me compute the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\). So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. Now, the expression also has another part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this part as well. Wait, but the term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second part when considering the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\)? Hmm, but wait, no, because when we multiply the two expressions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will actually be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because any term in the second expansion will multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\), but since we only care about \\(a^2b^2\\), the part from the second expansion can be anything, but the coefficient will just be multiplied by 6. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. Wait, no, actually, when we multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the terms that multiply to give that term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second part, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 - 2m = 0 \\Rightarrow 2m = 6 \\Rightarrow m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 6! is 720, and 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) is 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yeah, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me double-check. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider the term from the second expansion that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, which is the constant term, which is 20. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply.

    "text": " Let me check that. So, when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\). Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of whatever term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that we're considering. Wait, but actually, I think I need to clarify: the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that term in the product will come from taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiplying it by any term from the second part. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, which only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine. But in this case, the second polynomial only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't sound right because the problem is probably expecting a specific coefficient, not a product involving all the terms. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every possible term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me check again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\), when we multiply them together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think differently: maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps it's 6, but that seems too simple. Wait, but when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply as well. So, for example, if you have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6 \\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the first part, and it will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by each coefficient in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's actually the sum of all possible coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that would be 6 times the sum of coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would combine. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me try another approach. Let me first compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when we multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(6 a^2b^2\\), the product will have terms like \\(6 a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, the coefficients in the second expansion are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), so the sum of these coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but considering all possible terms, so it's actually 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer is 384. Wait, but let me confirm this by another method. Let me consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Yes, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, since this term is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the total coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Let me compute the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). The binomial coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, so the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this as well. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so maybe I don't need to expand the entire second part because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only present in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part. Therefore, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I only need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and the entire second part will just be a constant multiplier. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. But in this case, the first expression has only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has only \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply them, the variables involved will be \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by any term from the second part, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. So, maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by whatever the coefficient is in the second part for the term that's being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the first part, and the second part can be any term in its expansion, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, perhaps it's 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't seem right because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all terms in the second part. Wait, no, that can't be. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply by the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which seems incorrect because coefficients are numerical, not expressions with variables. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would still include \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would include all possible terms from the second part, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not quite right either. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would mean that when you expand both parts and multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because coefficients are numerical, not expressions. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem didn't specify. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which seems unlikely. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a sum over all possible terms in the second expansion, each multiplied by 6. But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a single coefficient, not a polynomial. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too complicated, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve all possible terms from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which, as I thought earlier, is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, let me check that again. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of coefficients is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. But let me think if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve considering each term in the second expansion. So, each term in the second expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), which has a coefficient of 6, the entire term would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) times \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum over all k of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved, and I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd. Alternatively, if the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because coefficients are numerical. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me think of it another way. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The product will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - m}c^{-m}\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, and it's multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve all possible terms from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical. Therefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. That seems plausible. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2(c + 1/c), and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed \\(c + 1/c\\), which is the sum of coefficients in the second expansion times the coefficient from the first part. So, in this case, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting a numerical value, implying that \\(c\\) is set to 1, making the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient as a polynomial, so the answer would be 6\\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But I think more likely, the problem is asking for the coefficient when all variables are considered, so it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. If I expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of its coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so it's 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the final answer is 384.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expansion is multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But if the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps they want it evaluated at a specific value, but since it's not specified, maybe it's just 6 times the expansion, which is 6\\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But I think the problem is more likely expecting a numerical coefficient, so 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nWait, but in the example I did earlier, with \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, so perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient is 6\\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem didn't specify, so perhaps that's the answer. Alternatively, if they're asking for the coefficient when \\(c\\) is 1, it's 384. But without more context, it's hard to say. However, since the problem didn't specify, I think the most accurate answer is 6\\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but if they want a numerical value, it's 384.\n\nWait, but the problem is stated as: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6\\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved, and perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, so I think 384 is the answer they're looking for. Therefore, I'll go with 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by expanding each part separately and then combining the results. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a sum of coefficients equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\) when \\(c = 1\\).\n3. Multiply the two coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

Hmm, maybe not, because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, right? Because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, so when you multiply by the second part, which doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a Laurent polynomial. The sum of its coefficients would be when we set \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that accurate? Because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the second expansion will contribute to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes all possible powers of \\(c\\). But wait, no, that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the same as in the first part, because when you multiply by the second expansion, each term in the second expansion adds a factor involving \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 times the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will have a coefficient that is the product of the coefficients from each part. Specifically, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(1\\) (i.e., the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when expanded. Wait, that's different. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, i.e., the constant term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the coefficient from the second part (which is 20). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that makes more sense. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients, but actually, I only need the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the correct coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) with the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1.

    "text": " Let me compute the binomial coefficient for that term. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is equal to \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider both parts together. But wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so maybe the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will just contribute a constant factor when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me check that. \n\nSo, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe we just need to find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and multiply it by 6. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that don't involve any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because each term in the second part would multiply each term in the first part. So, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nWait, no, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes only from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\), and then it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only, I think that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that might not be correct because each term in the second part would have different powers of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself doesn't involve \\(c\\), so to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\) (which is 1), you get \\(a^2b^2\\). If you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any other term involving \\(c\\), you get a different term, which doesn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWe already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's apply the binomial theorem again to expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, we have \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) which means \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. 6! is 720, and 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the coefficient is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) indeed just the product of the coefficients from each part? Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, making it not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 in the second part will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. \n\nTherefore, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But only the term where the second polynomial's term is 20 (the constant term) will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) because multiplying by any other term would introduce a power of \\(c\\), making it something like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but hold on, is that correct? Because when you multiply polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of the products of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only term in the second polynomial that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is the constant term, which is 20. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, if I think about the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the constant term in the second polynomial, so 6 * 20 = 120 is correct. \n\nI think that's it. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

But wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I need to consider the entire product? But the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, that might mean that I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, maybe the coefficient is just 6, regardless of the other part? Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in \\((a + b)^4\\) and doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when it's multiplied by the other expression, it will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it, when we multiply, the only way to get a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) is if it's multiplied by a term that is \\(c^0\\), which is 1. Because if we multiply by any other term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, but the question is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), which has no \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, that makes sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1 would give \\(a^2b^2\\), and if we multiply by any \\(c\\) term, it would add a \\(c\\) component, which we don't want. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again to this part. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 is when m = 3, which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). So, that would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which gives 120. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Since the two parts are independent, their coefficients multiply when considering the product. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2\n\\]\nThe coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nWait, but the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient I found is just for the first part. But I think I might be misunderstanding the problem. Maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, so maybe they don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, that might be the case. Let me think. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and then multiplied by any term from the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient should just be the coefficient from the first part, right? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it would introduce \\(c\\) terms, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that would only happen if we multiply by the constant term in the second expression. Wait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term because all the exponents of \\(c\\) are either positive or negative. So, does that mean that when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expression, it would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) component, so there wouldn't be a term without \\(c\\), meaning the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be zero? Wait, that seems contradictory to my initial thought. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(c\\) and \\(a\\), \\(b\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would just be 6, as found earlier. But that seems too straightforward, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) might contribute a factor that affects the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think: when you expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would only come from the terms where the product doesn't introduce any \\(c\\) terms. But wait, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it must be multiplied by the term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), which is 20. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 20, you get \\(20a^2b^2\\), which is the only term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe the coefficient is just 6, but now I'm getting 120. So, which is correct? Let me double-check. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's 6a^2b^2. Then, when we multiply this by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc., the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to multiply by the constant term, which is 20. So, 6a^2b^2 * 20 = 120a^2b^2. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. So, the correct answer should be 120.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the variables are separate, but since the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only considering the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so any term from the second expansion that's a constant (i.e., without \\(c\\)) would affect the coefficient. So, yes, I think 120 is correct. Let me confirm the binomial coefficients for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponents are 6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6 for k=0 to 6. So, the constant term is when 6 - 2k = 0, which gives k=3. So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which matches what I thought earlier. So, the coefficient from the second part is 20. Then, the coefficient from the first part is 6, so the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of c is zero, which is when 6 - 2k = 0, so k=3, and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so that's correct. So, multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me think about how the entire expansion works. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is 6a^2b^2, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, it becomes 6a^2b^2 \\times (terms involving c). So, the only way to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c's is to multiply by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, 6a^2b^2 * 20 = 120a^2b^2. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using generating functions or multinomial coefficients, but I think the approach I took is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product of two separate binomial expansions and then look for the terms where the variables a and b have exponents 2 each, and the variables c and 1/c have exponents that sum to zero. But in this case, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve c, the only contributing term from the second expansion is the constant term, which is 20. So, that's consistent with what I found earlier.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120. Therefore, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem**:\n   The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\).

Wait, no, actually, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply the two expressions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will just contribute a factor, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give the desired term. But in this case, since \\((a + b)^4\\) only has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) only has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), there's no overlap that would affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. That is, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's actually the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. But wait, no, that's not correct either because each term in the product will have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we are considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but actually, no. Because each term in the product will be \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because for each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\), but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's actually the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is when you set \\(c = 1\\), which would give \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) times 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part), which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when you multiply it by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\). So, if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But wait, maybe that's not correct because the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all terms, but perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Wait, no, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so it's just the coefficient, regardless of the other variables. So, when you multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which has coefficients as per the binomial expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes in such problems, you might need to consider specific terms, but in this case, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's correct to multiply by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Let me check that: when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). So, the coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the entire expression, not just the first part. Hmm, but the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I don't need to consider the other terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), right? So, maybe the coefficient is just 6, and the rest of the expression doesn't affect it. Wait, but let me think again. The expression is a product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find all the terms in the second expansion that are constants, i.e., terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a constant term from the second expansion, it will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). If we multiply by a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the resulting term will involve \\(c\\), which is not part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. So, let me calculate the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) is 720/(6\u00d76) = 720/36 = 20. Yeah, that's correct. So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, first, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. So, 6 \u00d7 20 is 120. Yeah, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the second part doesn't affect this term? Or does it? Hmm, I think I might be misunderstanding. Wait, no, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part.

So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first polynomial, then in the product, that term will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. But since we're only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, that doesn't sound right either.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire expansion, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would make the coefficient a sum, which might not be a single number. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, so when you expand it, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering the \\(c\\) terms, maybe it's just 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384? Wait, but that seems too large. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, times the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, meaning that we have to consider all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, each multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the answer is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that seems too simple, and I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not stated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would give a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in the original polynomials. But in this case, the first polynomial has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but since the variables are different, the cross terms don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting a numerical value. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by other variables. So, maybe the answer is 6. But that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let's expand both parts separately and then see how the terms combine. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(a^4, 4a^3b, 6a^2b^2, 4ab^3, b^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded using the binomial theorem, is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion of the second part has terms like \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6\\) times each coefficient from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be \\(6 * 1 = 6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would be \\(6 * 6 = 36\\), and so on. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we need to sum all these coefficients? Or is it asking for the coefficient in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\)? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numbers. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, as I thought earlier, giving 384. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by other variables. So, the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simple, and I'm not confident in that answer.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, the variables involved are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by the second part, which involves \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that's the product of 6 and each coefficient from the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering \\(c\\), perhaps it's just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. Hmm, that seems plausible.\n\nWait, let me confirm. If I consider the entire product, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has coefficients like 1, 6, 15, 20, etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6 * 1 = 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6 * 6 = 36, and so on. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all these coefficients, which would be 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384. So, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but let me check the sum inside the second expansion: \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} + \\dbinom{6}{1} + \\dbinom{6}{2} + \\dbinom{6}{3} + \\dbinom{6}{4} + \\dbinom{6}{5} + \\dbinom{6}{6}\\). That's 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64. So, yes, 6*64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I'm not sure if the problem is asking for the coefficient considering all powers of \\(c\\) or just the coefficient in the first part. But given that the problem includes both parts, I think it's asking for the coefficient in the entire product, which would involve summing over all the \\(c\\) terms. So, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by other variables. But that would mean the coefficient remains 6, which seems too simple. But considering that the problem includes both parts, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). The product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, that term will be multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient in P times the entire Q, which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's expecting the coefficient in P times the sum of coefficients in Q, which is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6*20=120, because the term where \\(c^0\\) is the middle term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}=20\\). But that's just a guess.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, and if we're considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, maybe it's just 6, the coefficient from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it. But that seems inconsistent with the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, perhaps it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, that seems to make sense. So, I think the answer is 384.\n\nBut to make sure, let me do a small test. Suppose I have a simpler case: \\((a + b)^1 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) is 1. The expansion would be \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, if I were to find the coefficient of \\(a\\), it would be \\(c + 1/c\\). But if I'm just looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\), without considering \\(c\\), then it's the entire expansion \\(c + 1/c\\). But if I set \\(c = 1\\), the sum of coefficients is 2, so the coefficient would be 1*2=2. But in reality, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. So, perhaps in that case, the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. So, maybe in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, which might not make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient from the first part, which is 6.\n\nWait, but that contradicts the earlier reasoning. I'm getting confused. Maybe I should just go with the initial thought that the coefficient is 6, since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so it doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the answer is 6.\n\nWait, but then why is the second part given? It must play a role. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the answer is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem to expand each part separately.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nThe sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n\\[\n(1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nSince the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and this coefficient is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."
