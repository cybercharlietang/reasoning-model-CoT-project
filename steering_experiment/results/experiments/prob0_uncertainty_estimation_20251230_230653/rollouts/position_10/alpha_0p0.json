So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts together. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because those are separate variables. In other words, when I multiply the two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficients from the second part won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, is that right? Let me think again. Actually, no, that's not correct. Because the entire expression is the product of two expansions, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes solely from the first part, right? Because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is being multiplied, so the coefficient would be 6 times whatever the sum of the coefficients in the second part is. But wait, no, that's not right either. Let me clarify: when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients of the terms multiply. But in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is from the first part, and it's being multiplied by every term in the second part. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. Wait, is that correct? Or is it that each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, the specific term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, and the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, each of these will result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are zero, i.e., the constant term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you get \\(a^2b^2\\), and when you multiply it by other terms, you get terms with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which are not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient we're looking for is 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nOkay, so now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part), which equals 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the first part gives us 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part's constant term is 20. Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, if I consider the entire expansion, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. All other terms would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the term not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, only the constant term from the second expansion matters. Therefore, 6 * 20 = 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, maybe I don't need to consider the second part because \\(a^2b^2\\) is already in the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it will still have \\(a^2b^2\\) as part of it, but the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the terms in the second expansion.

Maybe I just need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has multiple terms, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would then be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the product will be \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (some term in \\(c\\)). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the other terms involve \\(c\\), which are separate variables. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of the second part. Wait, that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion.

So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, if I take the coefficient 6 from the first part and multiply by 64, I get 384. But wait, that would be the coefficient if we were considering \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire second expansion, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because for each \\(m\\), the term \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\) is multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for all \\(m\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, that seems high, but let me check. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider only the term where \\(c\\) is raised to a specific power, but the problem doesn't specify, it just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's 6 times the entire sum of the second expansion's coefficients, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But let me confirm. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that when multiplying the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me think again: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the first polynomial is multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.

Then, since this term is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the total coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, actually, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that entire expression, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the whole expression will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but the other part is in \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the expression is a product of two binomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I expand the entire expression, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come only from the first part, and it will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion, each time. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think I need to consider that when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But that seems a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, as I found earlier. Now, when I multiply this by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those coefficients will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, to find the total coefficient, I need to compute 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in thinking that I need to multiply by the sum of all coefficients. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form (coefficient from first part) * (coefficient from second part) * a^2b^2 * c^k * (1/c)^m, where k + m = 6. But since the problem is only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient will be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and we're summing over all possible terms in the second expansion. So, that's why the sum of coefficients is 64, as I found earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but let me verify this with another approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6a^2b^2, and when multiplied by the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by 6a^2b^2, each of those coefficients contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). As I calculated before, the sum of coefficients is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since the second part is multiplied by this term, the entire coefficient becomes 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which includes all the terms in \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. So, sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Then, 6 * 64 = 384. Yes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Hmm, so I guess I need to consider how this multiplication affects the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, right? So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nAlright, so let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. That would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nNow, I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, I set the exponent equal to zero: \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\) which means \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the constant term 20 from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first binomial and the constant term in the second binomial. Since the second binomial doesn't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), only the constant term contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the final product.

So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second part, the product would have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m (1/c)^n\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m + n = 6\\) in the second part. But the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps we can treat the two parts separately. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier, and then multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times something, which would make it a polynomial, not a number. That doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is unusual. Maybe the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just another factor that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simple. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve considering the product of the expansions. So, perhaps I should consider the entire expansion of both parts and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, so when you multiply by the second part, which is a series in \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^m (1/c)^n\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that's not correct because the second expansion has terms with different exponents of \\(c\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion, which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a single coefficient. I'm getting confused here. Let me try a different approach. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are usually constants. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering terms where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, so that the term is a pure constant. In that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, let's try that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That seems plausible. So, let's work on the second part: the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these are separate parts of the product, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of these two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives us \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we use the binomial theorem again and find that it is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Hmm, I think so because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\).

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean we need to take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term in the product will be a term from the first expansion multiplied by a term from the second expansion. So, to get a term that only has \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by any term from the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will result in a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, that seems plausible. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, let me compute \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but let me think again: is that correct? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from the second expansion multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) will result in a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.

So, 6 * 64 = 384. That seems to make sense. Wait, but let me confirm by another approach. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions.

Since the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, as calculated earlier, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.

But wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should just be 6 times whatever the sum of coefficients is in the second part. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify.\n\nThe problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving various powers of \\(c\\), but none involving \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because any other term from the second part would introduce a power of \\(c\\), which we don't want in the term \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAlright, so I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand this using the binomial theorem as well. The expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.

So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the final product.

So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since the second expansion has terms involving \\(c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can remain as a term is if it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, because otherwise, you'd have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that.

Because the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's only in terms of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that can't be right because the second part might have multiple terms, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part's expansion. But wait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that's not quite right either. Because each term in the second part is a term with \\(c\\) raised to some power. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second part, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term, and when multiplied by other terms, it's part of a larger expression. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is a separate term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not a polynomial. Wait, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me try to approach it differently.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) terms. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first part, and the second part is a separate expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, to find the sum of the coefficients in the second part, I can set \\(c = 1\\). Because when \\(c = 1\\), each term becomes just its coefficient. So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems plausible. Let me check that again. The coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, when you multiply the two expansions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which has coefficients summing to 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that the entire expression is the product of two expansions. The first expansion has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has terms involving \\(c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms in the product will have combinations of these variables. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first part, and it will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product being equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) would mean that the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, leaving just a constant term. But wait, is that the case? Let me check. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when expanded, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, if I take 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part), I get 120. But wait, that contradicts my earlier result of 384. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing two different approaches. Let me clarify. The first approach was considering that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which gave me 6 * 64 = 384. The second approach was considering the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, and then multiplying by 6 to get 120. These are two different interpretations of the problem. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That would mean that all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some \\(c^k\\) term would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. On the other hand, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the correct interpretation is that we're considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by any term from the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but not \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nSo, to confirm, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is to consider the entire expansion. The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which has terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). When you multiply these two, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 6 down to -6 in steps of 2. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, all the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) will have their coefficients added together. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of the coefficients from the second part times the coefficient from the first part. Therefore, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be different. In that case, we would need to find the term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the correct answer is 384.\n\nI think I've convinced myself that the correct coefficient is 384. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Considering \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Combining both parts:**  \n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so maybe the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe I need to consider that the entire expression is a product, so when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that are constants, i.e., terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because only then, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will it contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, is that right? Let me think. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponent of \\(c\\), we get \\(6 - m - m = 6 - 2m\\). So, each term will have \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as I found earlier. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, for the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need to find the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because we only want the terms that don't involve \\(c\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\), and we set that equal to zero to find the value of \\(m\\): \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, since the two parts are multiplied together, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) correctly using the binomial coefficient, which is 6. Then, I considered that when multiplying by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), only the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) would contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term because any other term would involve \\(c\\) raised to some power, and we're only interested in terms without \\(c\\). So, I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) and found \\(m = 3\\), which is correct. The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is indeed 20. Multiplying 6 by 20 gives 120, so that seems right. I think I did everything correctly. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is 6. Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens when \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20. Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

I think I need to consider how this part affects the overall coefficient. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I might not need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\).

Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so when you multiply by the second part, which includes \\(c\\) terms, you end up with terms that have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\).

So, to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, if we consider the entire expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so when you multiply by the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\), which would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which we found to be 20. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then that would imply that we're considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by the second expansion, each term would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, you're adding up multiple terms with different \\(c\\) exponents. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone (without any \\(c\\)) would only come from the term where the second expansion contributes a \\(c^0\\) term. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in reality, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), whose sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that can't be right because when you multiply polynomials, the coefficients don't just add up like that. Wait, I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I need to clarify: When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\) and \\( \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 \\), the product is \\( \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m} \\). So, each term in the product is \\( \\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m} \\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and then it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\). So, perhaps the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, let me think again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the product, each term is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by every term from the second expansion. So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each coefficient, and then adding them all together. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. The sum of the coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier thought where I considered only the constant term. So, which one is correct? Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2, which is correct because when you expand, you get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2 (from \\(ac\\) and \\(a/c\\)). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part. So, applying that logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in my initial approach, I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. But according to this example, that's not the case. So, perhaps I was wrong earlier, and the correct approach is to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the sum of coefficients in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's take another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). Then, expanding, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\( (1 + 1)^2 = 4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1 * 4 = 4. Let's check by expanding:\n\n\\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\)\n\n\\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\)\n\nMultiplying them together:\n\n\\(a^2(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2) + 2ab(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2) + b^2(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\)\n\nThe term with \\(a^2\\) is \\(a^2c^2 + 2a^2 + a^2/c^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed 2, not 4. Wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion. Hmm, so in this example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is the coefficient from the first part (1) times the sum of coefficients in the second part (which is 4). But in reality, when I expanded, I saw that the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, not 4. So, that suggests that my earlier reasoning was incorrect.\n\nWait, so in this example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is 1 (from the first part) times 2 (the constant term in the second part). So, perhaps the correct approach is to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the constant term in the second part, not the sum of all coefficients. That makes more sense because in the product, only the constant term in the second expansion would result in a term without \\(c\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1 (from \\(c^0\\)) would be the term we're interested in. Therefore, in the first example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 (from the first part) times 2 (the constant term in the second part), giving 2, which matches the expansion. Similarly, in the second example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 times 2, which is 2, matching the expansion.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part (6) times the constant term in the second part (20), giving 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but in my first example, I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, but that was incorrect because the sum of coefficients is when you set \\(c = 1\\), which includes all powers of \\(c\\), but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion to give a term without \\(c\\). So, the correct approach is to take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the constant term in the second part.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this with another example to make sure. Let's say I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1. The constant term in the second expansion is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product should be 1 * 2 = 2. Expanding:\n\n\\((a + b)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\) = \\(a c^2 + 2a + a/c^2 + b c^2 + 2b + b/c^2\\)\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which matches 1 * 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is 2, which is 1 * 2. So, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, returning to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But in my earlier example, that didn't hold because the sum of coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64 in the original problem. But when I set \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, if I multiply 6 (from the first part) by 64, I get 384. But in the smaller example, that approach didn't work because when I set \\(c = 1\\), the second expansion becomes 4, and the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) was 2, not 1 * 4 = 4. So, that suggests that approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because when you set \\(c = 1\\), you're effectively summing all the coefficients, but in reality, each term in the product is a separate term with different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product isn't simply 6 * 64, because that would imply that all the terms are being added together, which isn't the case. Instead, each term in the product has a specific power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, which comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the correct coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the only term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when you multiply by the constant term, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I think I've got it now.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts and then combine the results.\n\n**Step 1: Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem.**\n\nThe binomial theorem states that:\n\\[\n(a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\n\\]\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), we're interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^{2}b^{2}\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from this part is 6.\n\n**Step 2: Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the constant term.**\n\nUsing the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\nThe coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Combine the results.**\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I need to expand this as well, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which involves only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), maybe the expansion of the second part doesn't affect this term? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).

But wait, that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product of two separate expansions. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because any term in the second part would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times something with \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, each term would have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of the coefficients of all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which could be \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, each of these will give a term like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean the coefficient when the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). But wait, in each of these terms, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it might just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part's terms are multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the entire expression is a product, so each term would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and \\(c\\) exponents. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). Hmm, that doesn't make much sense because in the product, every term would have some power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand it, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, each of these products will be terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part. \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Let me check that. The sum of all coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Because otherwise, if you just take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it would be the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64, multiplied by 6, giving 384. But maybe the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the term where \\(c\\) has exponent 0. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on \\(c\\), which isn't specified. \n\nSo, let's assume that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found to be 6. \n\nSo, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. When you multiply these two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expression is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) (which is 20) from the second expression, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, giving 384. But since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. However, usually, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term involving multiple variables, it's implied that the other variables should be at their lowest power or something. But in this case, since \\(c\\) is another variable, and the expression is a product, it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have varying powers of \\(c\\). \n\nSo, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me confirm this by considering the entire expansion. \n\nThe entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's just 6, because the second part doesn't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nBut I'm confused now. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. Each term in the product will have some power of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only exist if the second part contributes a term with \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, you'd have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), and the coefficient would be a sum over all those, which might not make much sense as a single coefficient. So, I think the intended answer is 120. \n\nLet me check this again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product would have coefficient \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the answer should be 120. \n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But I think that's not the case because the problem would have specified if it wanted the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\). \n\nSo, to summarize, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I can treat the two parts separately. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and since the second part is multiplied by it, the entire expression would have terms where each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is already 6, and when you multiply by the other expression, it's like you're scaling that term by each term in the second expansion. But actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because in the product, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes terms with various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct either. Because each term in the product would be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expression is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expression. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and since the second part is a separate polynomial, when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when you multiply by 6, it just scales the coefficient. So, as I thought before, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me check this again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second part could contribute to the coefficient. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. That doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and the coefficient would be the sum of all those coefficients. So, in other words, for each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms like \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\), when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of each of those terms. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so that would mean summing all those coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems to make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\), so it's just 6, but that seems unlikely because the second part is being multiplied. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient from this part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Wait, but that can't be right because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) vary depending on the power of \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), meaning that the answer is simply 6, as found earlier, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems too straightforward, and the problem includes both parts, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps it's considering the entire product, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and when multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me check what the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is. The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6, as found earlier, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that seems inconsistent with the problem including both parts. Maybe I need to consider that the entire product is a combined expression, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself is just 6, because the other part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\).

So, actually, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because if you take any other term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you'll have a non-zero exponent of \\(c\\), which would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2(1/c)^k\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense.\n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already did: it's 6.\n\nNext, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That is, the constant term when expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find this, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is the product of the two expansions, we need to multiply the coefficient from the first part (6) by the coefficient from the second part (20). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the key idea is that in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term from the second part. Because any other term from the second part would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would change the term to something like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are not \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

I'm supposed to multiply this by the first part, so the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interfere with the terms involving \\(c\\).

Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Actually, no, that's not quite right.

Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each coefficient of the second expansion, and then adding them all together. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me double-check that logic because sometimes I might make a mistake here. So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply them, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, each of these terms is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficients from the second part just scale the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Wait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient should be 384. But just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me recheck the steps.\n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Correct.\n\nThen, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Correct.\n\nSo, 6 times 64 is indeed 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me consider another approach to verify. Maybe expanding both expressions and looking for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But that might be more complicated because the second part has more terms, but perhaps I can consider that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will be \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, again, 6 times 64 is 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c, 1/c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, as before.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me just go through each step methodically.\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). The sum of all these coefficients is indeed 64 because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. Now, when you multiply the two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which effectively scales it by each coefficient in the second part. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 times 64, giving 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me consider if there's any other way \\(a^2b^2\\) could be formed. But no, because in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is unique, and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so it can't contribute to their exponents. So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first part, and then multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but another thought: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients add when the variables match. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so any term from the second polynomial multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we need to consider all the coefficients from the second part because each term in the second part will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) and contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the total coefficient is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 times 64, so 384.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the expansion of both parts and then multiply them together. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I wonder if the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will affect this coefficient. Let me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), does that mean that the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by whatever the coefficient is for the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Wait, no, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, actually, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem doesn't specify any dependence on \\(c\\), I think we might be looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so we might have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. Hmm, that seems possible.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nLet me check that logic. So, if I have two polynomials, say, \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of a specific term in \\(P(a, b)\\) times \\(Q(c)\\) would be the coefficient of that term in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire polynomial \\(Q(c)\\). But if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right either. Because when you multiply, each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(Q(c)\\), which would give terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for different \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the same as the coefficient in \\(P(a, b)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(Q(c)\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then that would require \\(k = 0\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(Q(c)\\).\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes both \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's think about the entire product. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and then it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that doesn't sound right. Because if I set \\(c = 1\\), I get the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, and then multiplying by 6 gives 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that we're treating \\(c\\) as another variable and just want the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a bit abstract.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems incorrect because the coefficient should be a numerical factor, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times whatever the coefficient is for each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is a numerical factor, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which, as I calculated earlier, is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too large. Let me check my reasoning again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6. When we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is multiplied by 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the \\(c\\) expansion would be 6 times that term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, but without any \\(c\\) terms. That is, we need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, that makes more sense. So, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, which is when \\(c = 1\\). But if I'm only considering the constant term, it's 20. So, which is correct? Let me think. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include any power of \\(c\\). But if we're only interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion, which would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's think about how the product works. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering terms where \\(c\\) is raised to a specific power, but the problem doesn't specify which power. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Now, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's not a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, but that seems incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, meaning that we need to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, as I calculated earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Let me check: the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so that part is correct. Therefore, if I'm multiplying the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) by 6, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 384. But that seems like the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, meaning that it's multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is 384. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me think differently. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), when multiplied by Q(c), will result in \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in Q(c). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient in P(a, b) times the entire Q(c). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in c, which isn't what the problem is asking for. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only considering terms where the exponents of a, b, and c are all specified, but the problem doesn't specify any exponents for c. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of Q(c), which is 64, giving 384. But that seems like a lot.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering c, which would mean that we're treating c as a separate variable and just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of c. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of Q(c), which is 64, so 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the problem differently. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's not a single number but a polynomial in c. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving 120.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify any power of c, so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of c. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the terms where c is raised to a specific power, but the problem doesn't specify which one. Alternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some k, but as it stands, it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think the correct interpretation is that we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, which is a single number, not a polynomial. That seems plausible because when you multiply by all terms in Q(c), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). So, perhaps that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, let me test this with a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The expansion would be \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product would be \\(c + 1/c\\). But if I set \\(c = 1\\), then the sum of coefficients is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2, which is the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. Similarly, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in my small example, if I set \\(c = 1\\), the product becomes \\((a + b)(2)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which matches the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. So, perhaps in the given problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, in my small example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating it as a polynomial in \\(c\\), then it's a polynomial. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient when \\(c = 1\\), then it's 384. But the problem doesn't specify any value for \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient as a polynomial, which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating again. Let me try to think of it differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges based on the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but in my small example, when I set \\(c = 1\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) becomes 2, which is the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. So, perhaps in the given problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. But now I'm getting 384. I need to figure out which approach is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from whether we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all powers of \\(c\\), or just the term where \\(c\\) is raised to a specific power. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in that case, the coefficient is a polynomial, which seems odd because coefficients are usually numbers. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product when expanded, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut let me check this with an example. Let's take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Expanding this, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(ab\\) in this product would be 2 times (c + 1/c), which is 2c + 2/c. So, the coefficient is a polynomial. Therefore, in the given problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient is a polynomial. But the problem says \"the coefficient\", implying a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when \\(c\\) is set to 1, which would give the sum of coefficients. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems incorrect because the coefficient should be a number.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to approach it differently. Let's consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) is from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) is from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, in the small example, when I set \\(c = 1\\), I get the sum of coefficients, which is 2, and the coefficient of \\(a\\) becomes 2. So, perhaps in the given problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times the constant term, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but in that case, the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the problem as two separate expansions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384.\n\nBut the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient when \\(c\\) is set to 1, which gives the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, leading to 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the small example, when I set \\(c = 1\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) becomes 2, which is the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. So, perhaps in the given problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure. Let me try to compute it directly. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. When we multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is multiplied by 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is a polynomial, which seems odd, but perhaps that's the case.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when \\(c = 1\\), which would give the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, leading to 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient is a polynomial, but the problem just asks for the coefficient, so maybe it's 6 times the entire expansion.\n\nBut I'm stuck between two interpretations: either the coefficient is 120 (if we're considering the constant term in \\(c\\)) or 384 (if we're considering the sum of all coefficients in \\(c\\)).\n\nWait, perhaps I should look up similar problems. Typically, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, it's referring to the coefficient when all other variables are set to 1, which would give the sum of coefficients. So, perhaps the answer is 384.\n\nBut in my small example, setting \\(c = 1\\) gives the sum of coefficients, which is correct. So, perhaps in the given problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120, which is 6 * 20. So, which is it?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems incorrect because the coefficient should be a number.\n\nWait, I'm going to try to compute it directly. Let me consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Now, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm with another approach. Let's consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If we set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), then the value of the expression is \\((1 + 1)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 16 \\times 64 = 1024\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of this sum. However, when we set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), we're summing all coefficients, so the total is 1024. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384, which is part of the total 1024. So, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is "

    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but that part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), only \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second part? Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, and the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. However, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times\\) whatever the entire second part is. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is raised to the 6th power, which will have multiple terms. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so perhaps the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them together, the variables are separate, so \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part contributes nothing to the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) variables. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the sum of the coefficients in the second part is? Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms} \\) and \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\text{some terms} \\), then when you multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. If I want the sum of all the coefficients in that expansion, I can set \\(c = 1\\), because that would make each term equal to its coefficient. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but is that correct? Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're effectively multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, each with their own coefficients. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, is that the answer? Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, each of which has a coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems right. So, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), their coefficients are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part. But wait, the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so its \"coefficient\" for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero? No, that can't be right. Wait, no, because the second part is multiplied by the first part, but the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but the variables are separate. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which are all in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yeah, 6 * 64 = 384. I think that's correct. Alternatively, if I were to consider the entire product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be present in the product, and its coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) would be multiplied by each term in Q(c), which are terms like \\(c^k\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would have coefficient equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in Q. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P times the sum of all coefficients in Q? Because for each term in Q, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it creates a new term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) with coefficient equal to the product. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would have multiple terms, each with different powers of \\(c\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term would be zero because there's no \\(c\\) in that term. Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the problem is miswritten? Or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\)? Or is it considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? Wait, but in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges based on the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product only when \\(k = 2\\), and multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, but since the product includes terms with \\(c\\) as well, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because that's the only term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present without any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that's not correct because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term, which would require \\(c^0\\), then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. In that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion and then multiply it by 6. So, let's see. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The general term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, which interpretation is correct? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it would be 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 120. I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. If I have the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I expand it, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) is from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) depends on the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product only when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^m\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, if the problem had specified \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 120, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a simpler example to make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). Let's expand it: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1 = c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c) = a^2c + a^2/c + 2ab c + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but that's because the second expansion is only to the first power, so when multiplied by \\(a^2\\), you get \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\), but no \\(a^2b^2\\) terms. Hmm, but in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because it's not present. But in our original problem, the second expansion is to the 6th power, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), we get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself is zero unless we're considering it as part of a larger term. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as I calculated earlier. Because otherwise, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is zero, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is not a standalone term; it's multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps I was wrong earlier, and the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me think again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" If it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be zero because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is always multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) doesn't exist in the product, so its coefficient is zero. But that seems counterintuitive because the problem is asking for it, so maybe it's expecting the sum of coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it should be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. But without more context, it's hard to say. However, given that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the intended interpretation is that it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but in my earlier simple example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) was zero because there were no such terms. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because it's only multiplied by \\(c\\) terms, and \\(a^2b^2\\) itself doesn't exist as a standalone term. But that contradicts my earlier reasoning. Wait, no, in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a, b, c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the product, but it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of the coefficients of all terms \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the expression is multiplied by another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), right? So, when we multiply the two expansions together, the terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will combine.

Wait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can consider that any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will just be a constant multiplier for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be correct because each term in the product will be a combination of terms from both expansions. Let me think again. \n\nWait, no, actually, when you have two separate expressions multiplied together, like \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term (which has \\(c\\) raised to some power) will just be part of the overall product. But since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), we can think of it as the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Alternatively, since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate, the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as each term in the product being a combination of terms from both expansions. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (the coefficient from the first part) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part, when expanded, has a sum of coefficients equal to 64, so the overall coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check that. Let's think of a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{2}{0} = 1\\), and the second part is \\((c + 1/c)\\). The product would be \\(1 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2, right? Wait, no, because when you multiply \\((a + b)^2\\) by \\((c + 1/c)\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2\\) term is multiplied by \\(c\\) and by \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2c\\) is 1 and for \\(a^2 \\times 1/c\\) is 1. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is 1 + 1 = 2, which is indeed 1 (from the first part) times 2 (the sum of coefficients in the second part). So, this seems to hold. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure that the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64. Let's compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) when \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), and \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, yes, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this differently. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can think of it as the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another example to be sure. Let's say I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the first part is 1. The sum of coefficients in the second part is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product should be 1 * 2 = 2. Indeed, expanding the product: \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the terms are \\(a c\\), \\(a \\times 1/c\\), \\(b c\\), \\(b \\times 1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a c\\) is 1, of \\(a \\times 1/c\\) is 1, of \\(b c\\) is 1, and of \\(b \\times 1/c\\) is 1. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is 1 (from \\(a c\\)) plus 1 (from \\(a \\times 1/c\\)), which is 2. So, yes, this method works. Therefore, I can be confident that in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Then, each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a term of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, we get \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6\\) because \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the product's coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) can combine to give \\(c^0 = 1\\)) in the second expansion is the middle term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Wait, but that's not the sum of all coefficients, that's just the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). Wait, no, because if I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, that would be the term where \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). But wait, earlier I thought the sum of all coefficients is 64, but if I'm only considering the term where \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 20. But that doesn't make sense because the entire product would have terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm confusing two different concepts here. Let me clarify. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all products of coefficients from each part where the variables multiply to give \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient becomes 6 * (sum of coefficients in second part). \n\nWait, but let me think about it again. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), when multiplied by Q(c), is the coefficient in P times the sum of all coefficients in Q. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in Q, each term contributes its coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be different. In that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, it's 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not overcomplicating this. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficients involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but to double-check, let me compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. It would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of all coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), and the sum is \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the overall coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nWait, but the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts multiplied together. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), right? So, the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), unless there's a cross term. Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) part when considering the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that might not be correct. Because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by every term in the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes all possible terms. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when multiplied by any term from the second part, which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the resulting terms would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, but the original term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be present if there's a term in the second part that is 1, but \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term unless there's a term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Wait, so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't contribute anything to the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Hmm, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all terms in the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct either because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because we're looking for a specific term. Wait, I think I'm confusing myself here. Let me try to clarify.\n\nThe problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, you'll have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) multiplied by terms from the second expansion, which are of the form \\(c^m\\) or \\(c^{-m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-m}\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only include the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, i.e., the constant term in the second expansion. Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). But if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^1\\) or \\(c^{-1}\\), those would be different terms, not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. That makes sense because only the constant term in the second expansion will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied by the first part.\n\nSo, first, let's confirm the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). As I calculated earlier, it's 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me recalculate: \\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 720 / (6 \\times 6) = 720 / 36 = 20\\). Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6 and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, so when you multiply these two, you get 6 * 20 = 120. That should be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, I could consider that when multiplying two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and to get the same term in the product, we need to multiply it by the constant term from the second part. So, yes, that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's a possibility that the second part could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) in some other way. For example, maybe if there's a term in the second part that's a constant, but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think that's exactly what I did. So, the coefficient is 120. Hmm, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We seek the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."
