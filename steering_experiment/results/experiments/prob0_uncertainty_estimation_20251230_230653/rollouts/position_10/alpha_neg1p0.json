    "text": " Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the product of these two expansions. Hmm, but the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply the terms involving \\(c\\). But since I'm only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), I can just take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in that expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. However, wait, that doesn't seem right. Because when I multiply the two expressions, each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how the multiplication affects the coefficients. Wait, but actually, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply as well. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, its coefficient is 6, and when I multiply it by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms will have their own coefficients. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think I need to consider all possible terms in the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem correct because the problem is probably expecting a specific coefficient, not a sum. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, wait, maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but we're just interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), irrespective of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes to a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) overall is the sum of all those contributions. Wait, but that seems a bit odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Hmm, no, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's considering all terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that sum. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), if I set \\(c = 1\\), then the expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and since the other term is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simple, and the problem is probably expecting a more involved answer. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering that the other terms are multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, their exponents don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But again, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that when you multiply the two expansions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the constant term (in terms of \\(c\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), it would result in a term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because that's the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it gives a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let's calculate that. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find this, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That seems more reasonable. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients, but actually, only the constant term (with respect to \\(c\\)) will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) involved. Therefore, the correct coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term where \\(k = 2\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n\n   The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients found:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the expression also has a second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), I think that when we multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms don't interact with the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression should just be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, but actually, I'm not sure. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we multiply these out, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the variables \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\) are distinct, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression should be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the sum of the coefficients in the second part is. But actually, no, because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, when multiplied by any term in the second part, it will still be \\(a^2b^2\\) times something else, which would involve \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, no, because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so the terms are combined. But the question is specifically about \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). So, perhaps we are to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term involving \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. Let me expand both parts separately and then see how they multiply. First, as I did before, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). Now, the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by 6, will give the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but in reality, each term in the product will have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone (without considering \\(c\\)) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. But actually, no, because each term in the second part has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^{k}\\) is 6 times the coefficient from the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same across all those terms, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, we're to consider all terms in the product where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, and sum their coefficients. So, in other words, for each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient will be 6 times the coefficient from the second part. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expression is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any term from the second expansion, which is in terms of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all those contributions. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 64, which is 384. But let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all terms, which would mean that each term in the product contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a term in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that we need to sum over all possible powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second part. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), the coefficient is the sum over all possible \\(k\\), which is 6 times 64, so 384. Let me confirm this with another approach. Let's consider that \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, c^0, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\) with coefficients 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1 respectively. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each of the terms in the second expansion, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6 \\times 6 a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6 \\times 15 a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2\\), \\(6 \\times 15 a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(6 \\times 6 a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(6 \\times 1 a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) is 6 times the coefficient of that power in the second expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, we need to sum all the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\), which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as well. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't depend on the \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is a product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me clarify. When you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But is that correct? Let me think again. The coefficient of a term in a product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), each multiplied by their respective coefficients. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, it's not just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something else. So, actually, I think I made a mistake earlier. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, because \\(c^0 = 1\\). Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.

So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to figure out how this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But actually, wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the entire expression is a product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we can consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the entire second expansion, but wait, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part evaluated at the terms that don't involve \\(c\\). But wait, that can't be right because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term. Let me check that. When you expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). Now, to find the term that is a constant, which is \\(c^0\\), we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider the term in the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the first part gives us 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part's expansion has a constant term of 20. So, when we multiply these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term would indeed be 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part contributes a constant term, so the overall coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can approach this by considering the entire expansion. Let me think: when you expand \\((a + b)^4\\), you get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Similarly, when you expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get terms involving various powers of \\(c\\). Now, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we're looking for the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. So, as I calculated earlier, that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me confirm the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when \\(k = 0\\), it's \\(c^6\\), \\(k = 1\\), it's \\(6c^{4}\\), \\(k = 2\\), it's \\(15c^{2}\\), \\(k = 3\\), it's \\(20c^{0}\\), \\(k = 4\\), it's \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(k = 5\\), it's \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(k = 6\\), it's \\(c^{-6}\\). So, yes, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term (which is 6) by this constant term (20), I get 120 as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have products of expansions, you have to consider cross terms, but in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only contribution comes from the constant term in the second expansion. So, I think my approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as the product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and the constant term from the second polynomial. So, yes, that's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me also think about whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would include any terms that result from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) with any term from the second expansion. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the only way it can contribute to the coefficient is by multiplying with the constant term from the second expansion. So, yes, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables add up to that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and the constant term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about the entire expression. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to consider only the term in the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think I've checked this enough ways. I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the general term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).

So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when I multiply the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that term would contribute is if it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c\\), you'd get a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\) itself. So, the only time the product would have \\(a^2b^2\\) is when it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient we're looking for is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part. \n\nSo, let me first find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which is the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the constant term is 20. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and it's multiplied by 20, so the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through it again. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with a coefficient of 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when we multiply these two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expansion being the product of the two binomial expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part. So, the coefficient is indeed the product of the two individual coefficients. \n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

So, does that mean that the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), when we multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't interfere with the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).

Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any terms from the second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate term, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible terms from the second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion. But that can't be right because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the coefficients don't add up like that. Wait, let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times\\) the entire second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are scalars. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, which would be 6. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that \\(c + 1/c\\) is part of the same expression, and perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some specific term from the second expansion. But the problem statement doesn't specify, so I'm a bit confused. Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical. So, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating the second part as a separate expression, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of the second part. But that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in the second expansion. Because if we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, let me check that approach. So, the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but only considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms, which isn't a numerical coefficient. So, I think that's the right approach. Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together. So, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).

Hmm, this is confusing. Wait, maybe I should think of it differently. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second.

So, does that mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. Because in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and then it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me check. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient for each \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) term would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, no, actually, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and then when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times that expansion. But that can't be, because the coefficient should be a constant, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make more sense. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c^0\\) from the second part would combine to give \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when expanded, because the exponents go from 6 down to -6 in steps of -2. So, the term where the exponent is 0 is when k = 3 in the binomial expansion. Let me confirm that. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the term where \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was under a different interpretation. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me just verify this again. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. When you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second, resulting in \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) with coefficient 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the product of the coefficients from each part of the expression. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   The term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(k = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**  \n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, the coefficient here would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this as well. But wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), so does that mean the coefficient from the second part is just 1? Because when you multiply by something, if it's not affecting the term you're interested in, it just stays as 1. Hmm, but actually, maybe I need to think differently. Wait, no, the entire expression is the product of two expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and the second part contributes a factor that's multiplied by it. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient from the second part would just be the constant term, which is when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Let me check that.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the term in the second expansion that is a constant (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) and then multiply it by the coefficient from the first part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, so now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the constant term from the second part is 20. Therefore, when we multiply these together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. So, first, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) correctly using the binomial theorem, which gave me 6. Then, I considered the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and realized that since we're looking for the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) (because \\(a^2b^2\\) has no \\(c\\) terms), we need the constant term from the second expansion. I used the binomial theorem again, set the exponent to zero, found \\(m = 3\\), and calculated the coefficient as 20. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, which seems correct. \n\nWait, but another thought: since the entire expression is a product of two expansions, each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find all the ways that the second expansion contributes a constant term, which is only one term, as we found. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just check with an alternative approach. Alternatively, I could consider the entire expansion as a product and think about how the terms combine, but that might be more complicated. Alternatively, I could consider that each part is independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the coefficient of the constant term from the second part, which is exactly what I did. So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations just to be sure. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, that's correct. Then, for the second part, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, yes. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Yep, that seems right.\n\nAnother way to think about it: when you have \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is the middle term, which is 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the middle term is when \\(m=3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so that's correct. So, when you multiply these two, you get 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's solid.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the constant term, where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.

So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is part of the first part, and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that part doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, no, actually, I think I might be overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply them, each term will be a product of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the term \\(1\\) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not correct because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term. Wait, does it? Let me check. Let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) will be \\(6 - 2k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to 6. So, the exponents are 6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6. So, when \\(k = 3\\), the exponent is \\(6 - 6 = 0\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k=2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives 6, and then the constant term in the second expansion is 20, so 6*20=120. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, but no, that's not correct because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean we need to sum over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But wait, no, that's not correct either because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all possible powers of \\(c\\). Wait, actually, no. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the context of the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6*64=384. But that seems too high, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials. So, when you expand the entire expression, you'll have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{-m}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not a number; that's a polynomial. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's expecting a numerical coefficient, implying that perhaps \\(c\\) is a variable and we're treating \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term regardless of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so the coefficient would be 6*20=120. That seems more plausible. Let me check that again. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving \\(6*20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. That makes sense because any other term from the second expansion would introduce a power of \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we have to consider all possible combinations where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not right. If we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, implying a numerical value. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, i.e., the term where \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient would be 6*20=120. That seems more reasonable. Let me confirm that. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by any term in the second part. But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would include all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the constant term in the second expansion, so the coefficient is 6*20=120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and ignoring the second part, but that can't be right because the expression is a product of both. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which is possible. However, the problem is asking for a coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting a numerical value. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the terms where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, so the coefficient is 6*20=120. I think that's the most plausible answer. So, to recap: In \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Therefore, when multiplying, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives the coefficient 120.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, perhaps when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient in the first part times the entire second expression, but that doesn't seem right because the second expression is not a constant. Alternatively, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient in the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the exponents of different variables don't interfere with each other. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part would just get multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the same as in the first part, because each term in the second part is a multiple of \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself. Wait, but that seems a bit confusing. Let me think again. When you have two expressions multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then any term in \\(P(a, b)\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\), then in the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for each term in \\(Q(c)\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not the case. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the entire \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) would just add a factor that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire \\(Q(c)\\). But that can't be right because \\(Q(c)\\) is a sum of terms, not a single number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might make sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is a multiple of \\(c^k\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all those terms would be the coefficient in the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. But wait, that's not exactly correct. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient in the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each coefficient times \\(c^k\\), and if you're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then you would sum all those coefficients. Wait, but no, because each term is \\(a^2b^2\\) times a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), so if you're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the coefficient in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found earlier to be 6. Then, we need to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by evaluating the polynomial at \\(c = 1\\). So, let's compute \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all because they are separate variables. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and since the other part is multiplied by this, the coefficient would just be 6 times whatever the entire second expression is. But that doesn't make sense because the second expression isn't a constant; it's a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression, which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all the terms in the other polynomial, but if you're looking for the coefficient of a term that only involves the variables from the first polynomial, then the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by the first polynomial's term, adds to the overall coefficient of that term in the product. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, let me make sure. Let me compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I said earlier, setting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. So, 6 * 64 is indeed 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it as the coefficient in the first part times the entire second part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial, not a constant. So, the correct approach is to take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which gives 384. Therefore, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and I notice that \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only present in the first part, while \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second part. That means that the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\) when multiplying. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. However, since the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire expansion of the second polynomial.

Wait, but no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the second polynomial is being multiplied by each term in the first. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial. But wait, the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a Laurent polynomial, meaning it has negative exponents as well. But when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I'm only concerned with the part of the product that comes from \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term from the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total contribution is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, as calculated before. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the product of the two expansions. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, I get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that means that for each \\(k\\), the term \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But wait, that's just 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\), which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384, as before. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me check with another approach. Suppose I consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and then multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since each of those terms is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the total coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables, so here, plugging in \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but the product is a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and when you multiply by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not correct because each term in the second part is a specific power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not right either because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's like each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in the second part. But actually, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would have coefficients multiplied by each term in the second part, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't include \\(c\\), perhaps we're only looking for the constant term in the second part, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is the product of 6 and the constant term in the second part. So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me try that approach. So, first, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the constant term in the second part is 20. So, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to 6 times the constant term of the second part? Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms involving \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would have a coefficient of 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's actually the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient is a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering that it's multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that interpretation might not make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so it's actually a separate term. Wait, no, when you multiply, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for different \\(k\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's actually the sum of all coefficients of terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion, which would be 6 * \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a single coefficient. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the second part, which would give the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) involved. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term would be \\(a^2b^2 * 20\\), so the coefficient is 120. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens when \\(k = 3\\), giving the constant term as \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Wait a second, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean I can ignore the second part because it's multiplied by something else? Hmm, but actually, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part involves variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), maybe the coefficients are independent?

So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get a product where each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. However, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if the term from the first expansion is \\(a^2b^2\\) and the term from the second expansion is 1 (i.e., the constant term). Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) times something with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it won't just be \\(a^2b^2\\) anymore. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and multiply it by the coefficient of the constant term in the second part. \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. \n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) which means \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that can't be right because 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) is 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the coefficient of the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the entire expression. When you multiply two polynomials, each term is a product of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the constant term will result in a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by 1, so the coefficient will be 6 * 20 = 120. Any other terms in the second part would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, I think that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (\\(c^0\\)) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\).

So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the expression also has another part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that this part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when I multiply the two parts together, the coefficients from each part will multiply as well. Wait, but I'm only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, right? So, does that mean the coefficient from the second part doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, I need to consider the coefficient from the first part and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, but wait, no, that's not right. Wait, actually, no, because when you multiply the two expressions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but that seems incorrect because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify: the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interfere with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we only need to consider the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that has \\(a^2b^2\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because every term in the second expansion will be multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because we're looking for a coefficient, not an expression. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be \\(6\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical coefficient. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), but that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term in \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Wait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion, but the problem doesn't specify, so I'm confused. Wait, maybe I should look at the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the coefficient of some specific term in the second expansion, but the problem doesn't specify, so maybe I'm overcomplicating. Wait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term. Let me check that possibility. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a numerical value. Let me try that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering only the constant term in the second expansion, would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, that makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, resulting in a term \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), so it's more likely that the problem is expecting the constant term, which gives 120. So, I think the answer is 120. Let me just double-check my steps: 1. Found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. 2. Expanded \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and found the constant term is 20. 3. Multiplied 6 by 20 to get 120. That seems correct. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so when I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to see if multiplying by terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) affects the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait a second, the second part only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply, any term from the second expression will be multiplied by a term from the first expression. But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the only way that the resulting term would still be \\(a^2b^2\\) is if it's multiplied by 1, because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor. Wait, but that can't be, because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term unless it's multiplied by a term that cancels out the \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first factor, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second factor, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when I multiply them together, each term from the first factor is multiplied by each term from the second factor. But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply it by the second factor, it's like \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the result would be terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the original problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only occur if the second factor contributes a term that is 1, which is not possible because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term. Wait, is that true? Let me check. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) will be even numbers from 6 down to -6, stepping by 2 each time. So, the exponents are 6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6. Wait, when \\(m = 3\\), the exponent is \\(6 - 2*3 = 0\\). So, the term when \\(m=3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 * 1 = 20\\). So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) does have a constant term, which is 20. So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by this constant term, I get \\(20a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but is that correct? Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20, giving 20a^2b^2. But wait, isn't that the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product? Because any other term from the second factor would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so the only way to have a term without \\(c\\) is when the exponent is zero, which is when \\(m=3\\), giving 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me think again: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply for the terms that result in the same variables. So, in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   Since the constant term in the second expansion is 20, multiplying it by the coefficient 6 from the first expansion gives:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to consider this part as well, but wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean I can ignore the second part? Hmm, no, maybe not. Because the entire expression is a product, so the terms from both expansions will multiply together. But wait, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think.

But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, which has variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, unless the second part has a constant term (i.e., a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero), the resulting term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have some power of \\(c\\) attached to it. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that perhaps the problem is considering only the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times some coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Hmm, that's unclear. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's considering the entire expression, which includes terms with \\(c\\). But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), ..., \\(c^0\\), etc., up to \\(c^{-6}\\). Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have coefficients multiplied by each of those terms. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, no, that can't be right because each term in the product will have different powers of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself in the product will actually be a term that is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the sum of all terms in the second expansion. But that's not possible because each term in the product will have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear as a standalone term is if there's a term in the second expansion that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because then \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant would still be \\(a^2b^2\\) times a number, making it a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would require finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). So, to clarify, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), and that's the term we're interested in. Therefore, I need to find two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I have both coefficients, I can multiply them together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, let's tackle the second part: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expression, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k=2\\) in the first part, and it's multiplied by the term where \\(k=3\\) in the second part because that's where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}c^0\\), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Yep, that makes sense. So, I think I'm confident that 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)? Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, no, maybe I do. Because the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply them together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term is in the first part, and in the second part, I have to consider all terms because they are multiplied by the terms from the first part. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. But since I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the part of the expression that involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is already fixed as \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the second part is just multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a constant with respect to \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part is just a polynomial in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that, it's like \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. But that seems too simple. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the entire expression is a product of two expansions, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes only from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would be 6 times \\(2^6\\) because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has coefficients that sum to \\(2^6\\). Wait, but that might not be correct. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient for each of those terms is added together as part of the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Now, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is just 6. But that seems too simple, and the problem includes both expansions, so perhaps the 6 is multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), maybe it's just 6. Hmm, I'm confused. Let me try another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k \\times c^m \\times (1/c)^n\\), where \\(k\\) is from 0 to 4, and \\(m + n = 6\\). But when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're only concerned with the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, as calculated before. Now, for each such term, we have \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{m} \\times c^{-n}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{m - n}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by 6, becomes part of the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is just 6. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion does contribute to the overall coefficient when considering the entire product. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't what the problem is asking. The problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Wait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. That doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is just 6. But that seems too simple, and I think the problem is expecting a larger number. Let me check my reasoning again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6. Then, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has a sum of coefficients equal to 64, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm wondering if I need to consider the expansion of this part as well. But wait, the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, maybe the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because it's a separate variable. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of two expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interfere with the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the second expansion isn't a constant; it's a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps I can treat the two parts separately. That is, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier, and then consider how this term interacts with the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but when you multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that: \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when multiplied by the entire second expansion, each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 is indeed 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of any term in the second part is just multiplied by this 6, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. That makes sense. Wait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and when you multiply it by the second polynomial, it's as if you're distributing \\(a^2b^2\\) across each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6*64=384.

So, the coefficient is 6, and the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider both parts. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Maybe I can expand that as well. Let me try that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

So, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) might not affect this coefficient because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think. When we multiply the two expressions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, when multiplied by any term in the second part, it will become \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the exponent of \\(c\\) doesn't matter here because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables. \n\nWait, that might not be entirely accurate. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient will be the same as in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. \n\nActually, no, because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that can't be right because the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\)? Hmm, but that seems too straightforward. Let me verify. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, yes, that would make the coefficient \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me check that logic again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms has a coefficient, say \\(C_m\\), and the term becomes \\(6C_m a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you collect all the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), their coefficients are all \\(6C_m\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times (C_0 + C_1 + C_2 + C_3 + C_4 + C_5 + C_6)\\). \n\nAnd since \\(C_0 + C_1 + C_2 + C_3 + C_4 + C_5 + C_6\\) is the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure that this approach is correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient remains as it is in the first part, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is not a constant. Hmm, that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps my initial approach was correct, that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me consider another approach. Maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part. But that's not correct because the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so the coefficient from the second part is 1, but that doesn't make sense. Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing the variables. \n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the entire second part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) is in the other, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is considering the coefficient as a constant, independent of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me check with a small example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because in the first part, the highest power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is 2 each, but in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would require multiplying \\(a^2\\) by \\(b^2\\), but in the first part, the term is \\(2ab\\), so when multiplied by \\(c + 1/c\\), the term \\(2ab \\times c\\) is \\(2abc\\), and \\(2ab \\times 1/c\\) is \\(2ab/c\\). There's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the first part only goes up to \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would require multiplying \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), which aren't present in the first part. Wait, but in this small example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^2\\) times \\((c + 1/c)^1\\). \n\nWait, so maybe in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is not affected by the second part because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) is in the other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But in the small example, the coefficient is zero because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\). So, perhaps my approach is incorrect. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is considering the entire expression and wants the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That is, the term where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, in that case, the coefficient from the second part would be \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, meaning \\(c^0\\), then we need to find the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nLet me check that again. In the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero occurs when \\(m = 3\\), because \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) implies \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, when we multiply this by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. When we multiply these two, we get 120. So, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would have a coefficient of 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But that seems unlikely because the problem probably expects a specific coefficient, not a sum. \n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is 120 because that's the coefficient when \\(c^0\\), which is the only term where \\(a^2b^2\\) would stand alone without any \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering all possible terms with \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all coefficients from the second expansion, leading to 384. \n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve multiplying each term from the first expansion by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the first expansion, and it would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Wait, but no, that's not correct because the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that suggests that perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it. But that can't be right because the problem includes both parts. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something like that, but as it is, it's \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, maybe the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the entire second expansion is multiplied by it, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient, perhaps it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but in the small example I thought of earlier, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. The terms would be \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2 \\times 1/c\\), \\(2ab \\times c\\), \\(2ab \\times 1/c\\), \\(b^2c\\), and \\(b^2 \\times 1/c\\). So, no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is zero. \n\nBut in our problem, \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6}\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{4}\\), etc., but there is no \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) term unless the second expansion has a constant term. Wait, in our problem, the second expansion does have a constant term when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(c^0\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would have a coefficient of \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nTherefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the answer is 120. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but the problem statement is \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nBut in the small example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no such term. So, perhaps the approach depends on whether the second expansion has a term that can combine with the first to form \\(a^2b^2\\). In our problem, since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's intended that we consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it, so the answer is 6. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. \n\nWait, perhaps I should look up the problem again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nBut in that case, the term would be \\(384a^2b^2\\), which is a constant term, but in reality, the product would have terms like \\(384a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(384a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., which doesn't make sense because each term in the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120. \n\nWait, but let me confirm by expanding a bit more carefully. The first expansion is \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the term is \\(20c^0 = 20\\). Therefore, when I multiply the first expansion by the second expansion, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20, giving \\(120a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the expansion of each part. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), giving \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**  \n   Multiply the coefficients from both expansions: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this part as well because the entire expression is the product of these two expansions. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, does that mean that I only need to consider the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the entire expression is a product of two binomial expansions. But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that only comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself won't have any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) in it. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient from the first part, which is 6? Or is there more to it?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm oversimplifying. Let me think again. The entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, every term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is just \\(a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it will result in a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^3\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), which is a different term. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) specifically, without any \\(c\\) terms, then that coefficient would only come from the case where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6.\n\nAlright, let's tackle that. So, I need to expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. The binomial theorem says that \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Let's solve for \\(k\\): \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) implies \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the expansion is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, it's 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, correct. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is 20, correct. Then, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply when you take the product of terms from each expansion. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion and the constant term comes from the second, their product gives the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."
