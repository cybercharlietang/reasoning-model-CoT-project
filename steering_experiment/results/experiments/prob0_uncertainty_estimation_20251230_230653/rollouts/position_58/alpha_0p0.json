    "text": " I don't think I missed anything here. The key was realizing that to get a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), we needed the constant term from the second polynomial, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. And then multiplying that by the coefficient from the first polynomial. So, yeah, 120 is the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the product of the relevant binomial coefficients from each part of the expression.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).\n   - Coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   - The term with \\(c^0\\) corresponds to \\(m = 3\\).\n   - Coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   - \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."
