    "text": " \n\nWait, hold on a second. I just realized something. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand the entire expression, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and the constant term (c^0) in the second expansion, as I thought earlier. But I just want to make sure that there are no other combinations that could result in \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\). Let me think: suppose I take a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) with, say, \\(a^3b\\) and multiply it by a term from the second expansion with \\(c^{-1}\\). Then, the resulting term would be \\(a^3b c^{-1}\\), which doesn't contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). Similarly, taking \\(a^1b^3\\) and multiplying by \\(c^1\\) would give \\(a b^3 c\\), which also doesn't contribute. So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, my earlier conclusion that the coefficient is 120 is correct.

    "text": " \n\nWait, hold on, I just realized something. The problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But when I multiply these two expansions, the terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) are separate from the terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

No, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so any term involving \\(c\\) would not affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, only the constant term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, giving the coefficient 120. So, I think I was right the first time. The answer is 120. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me write out the entire expansion for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and see. The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- \\(m=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\cdot c^6\\)\n- \\(m=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(m=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(m=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\)\n- \\(m=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(m=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(m=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the constant term is indeed 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by this expansion, the only term that will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) is the constant term 20, because any other term would bring a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would make the product have a \\(c\\) component, which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think I've thought this through thoroughly. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
