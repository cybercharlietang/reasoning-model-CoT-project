    "text": " Wait, actually, hold on a second. Let me think again. When you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion is a product of two polynomials. So, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and any term in the second part, but since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), unless the second part contributes a term that cancels out the \\(c\\) exponents, but since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), the only way that happens is if the second part contributes a term with \\(c^0\\). So, that term is just 20, as calculated. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think my initial conclusion was correct. But let me see if there's another way to think about this. Alternatively, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. Then, when you multiply by the second part, which is a series in terms of \\(c\\), the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to multiply by the constant term, which is 20. So, 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 * 20 = 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Yep, that makes sense. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 120. But just to make sure, maybe I can consider an example with smaller exponents to test the method. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\). In \\((a + b)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1. In \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 0 because the expansion is \\(c + 1/c\\), so there's no constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1 * 0 = 0, which is correct because when you multiply, you'd get \\(a^2c + a^2/c\\), so no constant term. Alternatively, if I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the first part is 1. In the second part, the expansion is \\(c^2 + 2c*(1/c) + (1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product is 1 * 2 = 2, which is correct because the product would be \\(a c^2 + 2a + a/c^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2.

So, the key is that when you multiply two expressions, the terms combine. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from the first part, and the constant term from the second part. So, the coefficients multiply. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right.
