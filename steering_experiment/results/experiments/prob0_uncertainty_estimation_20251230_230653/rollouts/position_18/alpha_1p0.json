    "text": " Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of the other part? But that seems too simple. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term would appear in the expansion as \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\), because the sum of coefficients is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems high. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct because I thought the problem was only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but maybe it's considering the entire expression, including the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion, but \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient of 6 multiplied by each term in the other expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6. But that seems too straightforward, and the problem includes the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part, so I think it's expecting me to consider that. Let me try a different approach. Let me consider the entire expansion. So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, as I calculated before. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me check this again because I'm not sure if I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in other words, when you multiply these two expansions together, you're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, it's the sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms multiplied by 6. So, yes, that would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the part up to \\(a^2b^2\\) and not the \\(c\\) terms, but I think that's not the case. So, I think the correct coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part is just a multiplier. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interfere with those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first expression, and the second expression has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that can't be right because the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when you expand it, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term from the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you expand, each term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\text{(sum of coefficients in the second expansion)}\\). So, I need to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). How do I find the sum of coefficients in a polynomial? I remember that the sum of coefficients is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when you have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But actually, no, because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 15c^4 + 60c^2 + 15 + 60/c^2 + 15/c^4 + 1/c^6\\right)\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think that's not the case. Wait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be the sum of all the coefficients that come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion. So, each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), that coefficient becomes part of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), etc. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think that's not the case. Wait, no, actually, the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when you expand, the entire expression will have terms like \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m / c^n\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by the entire other expression. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and then when you multiply by the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems high. Let me check another way. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct. Let me confirm by considering a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(b^2\\) in the first part when multiplied by \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Wait, but in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be multiplied by \\(c + 1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2, but actually, in the product, the terms are \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2/c\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 2, which is 1 * 2. Similarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is the middle term, which is the constant term. Because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you only want the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, so that the term is just a number, not multiplied by \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when you multiply, the variables are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had been \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be different. In that case, you would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion and multiply it by 6. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think it's 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because in the expansion, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and when you're looking for the coefficient of a specific term in one part, you have to consider all the terms in the other part. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me compute the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I did before, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's the answer. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), yielding \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these results gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Wait, no. Actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression multiplies each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and then I have to multiply it by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct?

So, the sum of all coefficients would be when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but wait a second. Let me think again. Because when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so when you collect like terms, you just add up all the coefficients from the second part and multiply by 6. So, yes, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But wait, let me check if I'm missing something. Because the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and when multiplied by the entire second part, it becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, yeah, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as two separate expansions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part is a generating function for terms involving \\(c\\). Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial (like \\(a^2b^2\\)) is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c\\) raised to various exponents, but when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), we can consider that each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just scales the coefficient by that amount. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because sometimes when you have multiple variables, you have to consider cross terms, but in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficient from the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part and the sum of all coefficients from the \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) part. So, yeah, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to compute the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6, and then when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it would be 6 times that entire expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that's \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64 \\). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's correct.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, and each of those would contribute to the coefficient. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Because each term in the \\(c\\) expansion has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those coefficients would contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, maybe I need to compute the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, no, let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the \\(c\\) expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), so the overall coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients add when the exponents match. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is in one part, and the other part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those terms will have a coefficient, and all of them will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the \\(c\\) expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient will be the product of the two coefficients. Wait, no, actually, no. Because the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables, so when you multiply, each term in the product will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) part. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the \\(c\\) expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and all those will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But wait, no, that's not correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all possible \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the \\(c\\) expansion is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, let me calculate the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of coefficients in a polynomial, you can substitute 1 for all variables. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in the original polynomials. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables, so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so all those coefficients add up. So, yes, the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but let me think again. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second polynomial, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, each of these terms will result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial, because all terms in the second polynomial will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But wait, let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. But no, because the second part is not just a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term will contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, I think that's correct. But let me make sure by considering a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Indeed, expanding, we get \\(a(c + 1/c) + b(c + 1/c)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which has coefficients summing to 2. So, yes, that approach works. Therefore, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which includes all terms from the second polynomial. So, maybe the answer is indeed 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem, and it's only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but the problem didn't specify that. It just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let's consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to terms with \\(a^4, a^3b, a^2b^2, a b^3, b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms with \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, 1/c^2, 1/c^4, 1/c^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64. So, when we multiply the two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so it's 6 * sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) * Q(c) is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because each term in Q(c) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so all those coefficients add up. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with another example. Suppose P(a, b) = (a + b)^1 = a + b, so coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1. Q(c) = (c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c, sum of coefficients is 2. Then, the product is (a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c. The coefficient of \\(a\\) is c + 1/c, which has coefficients summing to 2. So, 1 * 2 = 2, which matches. So, same logic applies here. Therefore, the answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the coefficients can interact differently. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their coefficients don't interfere. So, I think it's correct.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. The expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\). To find the sum of its coefficients, substitute \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nSo, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by:\n\n1.

So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps only the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would affect it. Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term that has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot 1/c^k\\), which would not be \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) would contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Let me check that again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I can take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in the second part, because only that term won't introduce any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors. So, the total coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Now, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems right.

So, only the term where we pick \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term from the second part would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yeah, that makes sense. Therefore, I think the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if I considered everything correctly. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).

Wait, but then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a very long expression. But that seems complicated, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives the sum of the coefficients. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k \\times c^{6 - m} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^m}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as I thought earlier. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, for the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, that's the same as saying 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which we found to be 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. But wait, let me double-check that. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest of the terms involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., where the exponent is zero. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number, not involving \\(c\\). So, let me try that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as before. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems more plausible because it gives a numerical coefficient, which is what I think the problem is asking for. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients, but actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the other expansion. So, the correct answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term (in \\(c\\)) from the second part, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that I didn't miss anything. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 for the constant term. Multiplying them gives 120. Hmm, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes in the binomial coefficients. Let me just verify \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) again: 4 choose 2 is indeed 6. And 6 choose 3 is 20, correct. So, 6 times 20 is 120. So, yeah, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all possible ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that would mean that the \\(c\\) terms must cancel out, i.e., multiply by a term that is \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found as 6. 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that second part. To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0. That means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(2k = 6\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part? No, that's not right. Because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). But since we're looking for the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, that's the only term that will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. Hmm, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6, and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20.

But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire product. So, perhaps I need to consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number.

That seems plausible. Let me check that. So, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But since the product is of two expressions, one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is when we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second part.

Wait, but that might not be correct because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial.

When you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term is independent of \\(c\\).

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the terms involving \\(c\\) would vary, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) part can be anything. So, the coefficient would actually be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? To find the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial, you can set the variable to 1.

Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that when you multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of the \\(c\\) part, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is just 6 because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficients would be multiplied as well. Wait, no, that's not correct. The coefficients are separate because the variables are separate. So, for example, if I have \\((a + b)(c + d)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(c\\) is 1, but when multiplied, the coefficient of \\(ac\\) is 1*1=1, and so on. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the product of two independent expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should just consider that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients get multiplied. Wait, no, because in this case, the variables are separate. So, for example, \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms with \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), because the \\(c\\) terms don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Wait, that makes more sense. Because when you multiply by something that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's like scaling the entire polynomial by that factor. So, if you have \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), but since \\(Q(c)\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is effectively scaled by the entire sum of \\(Q(c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems conflicting with my earlier thought. Let me think again. Let's say I have two polynomials: \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I multiply them, each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. When I multiply this by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), say \\(k c^m\\), I get 6k a\u00b2b\u00b2c^m. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) contributes its coefficient to the product. Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. Wait, but let me check with a smaller example to make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). So, expanding, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2, because when you expand, you get \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 for \\(a c\\) and 1 for \\(a/c\\), so total 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 (from \\((a + b)^1\\)) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which is 2, so 1 * 2 = 2. So, that seems to check out. Similarly, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\) times 2, so 2. Expanding, \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2c\\) is 1, \\(a^2/c\\) is 1, so total 2, which matches. So, applying that logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of coefficients, I substitute \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So, the sum is indeed 64. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. But in this case, since the variables are separate, the coefficients don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the other polynomial, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, it's 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), regardless of the other terms. So, in that case, it's just 6. But the expression also includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so perhaps the answer is more than that. Hmm, but the problem says \"in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\", so it's the product. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but that can't be right because when you multiply by the other polynomial, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is scaled by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then when I multiply them, each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product would be the coefficient of a^2b^2 in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because for each term in P(a, b), like a^2b^2, it's multiplied by every term in Q(c), so the coefficient becomes 6 * (sum of coefficients in Q(c)). So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should expand both expressions and see. Let's see, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\), with coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As we calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). So, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 (from \\(a c\\)) + 1 (from \\(a/c\\)) = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 (from \\((a + b)^1\\)) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which is 2, so 1 * 2 = 2. That works. Similarly, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\) times 2, so 2. And indeed, expanding, we get \\(a^2 c + a^2 / c + 2ab c + 2ab / c + b^2 c + b^2 / c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 + 1 = 2, which is 1 * 2. So, that works too.\n\nTherefore, applying the same logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of coefficients, I set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). That's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in the second expression is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

But wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to take the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) which is \\(6a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps I just need to consider the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the second part, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is another expression. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think that would mean that we're considering the entire expansion, but perhaps only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, leaving just \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, maybe not. Wait, actually, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me see. If I consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the expansion would have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times (1/c)^{6 - m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means \\(k = 2\\), so the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply by 6, you're adding up all those coefficients. But actually, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only present in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), only affects the powers of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we're looking for the coefficient when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., when \\(k - (6 - k) = 0\\), so \\(2k = 6\\), \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(c^3\\) is multiplied by \\(1/c^3\\), giving \\(c^0 = 1\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^3\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), as I found before. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^3\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) times \\(c^3\\) times \\((1/c)^{3}\\), but wait, actually, the general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{k} (1/c)^{6 - k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{2k - 6}\\). So, to get the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, we set \\(2k - 6 = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, so earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct? Let me see where I went wrong. The first approach was considering that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But that seems incorrect because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only involve the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1. Therefore, the correct approach is the second one, where I take the coefficient from each part and multiply them. So, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Let me confirm that. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, when you multiply these two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the final answer should be 120. I think that makes sense because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only affected by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. Therefore, 6 times 20 is 120. Yeah, that seems right. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

But that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is a separate variable. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, but without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that could be a possibility. Let me think again. If we have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then when we expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which are terms involving \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\).

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read it: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent.

But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). If that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product.

So, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when \\(k = 3\\), because each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, to get \\(c^0\\), we need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, then the overall coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. That seems more reasonable. So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me verify this. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), so that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 3} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^3 = 20 c^{3} \\times c^{-3} = 20 c^0 = 20\\). So, the coefficient is 20. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, so when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   We need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in this expansion. Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) gives \\(k = 3\\). Thus, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both parts:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Maybe I just need to consider the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that means we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents on \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, maybe we can treat the other part as a single coefficient. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not quite right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, but in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term in the expansion. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when you multiply it by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, no, because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're creating terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each coefficient is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, the second expansion \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficients in the second expansion are all \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, if I take the 6 from the first part and multiply it by 64, I get 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. But wait, let me check if that makes sense. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial because each term in the second polynomial is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), effectively contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yes, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. In that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, let me clarify: the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term, but in the product, it's multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, unless specified, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion and multiply it by 6. Let me check that. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I'm a bit confused. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) can be any integer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. Wait, but in reality, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), I think it's 384. Wait, but let me think again. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in each polynomial whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, the desired term is \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the first polynomial, we have \\(a^2b^2\\), and in the second polynomial, we have various terms involving \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient from the first polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 20 = 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384. Wait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 1 + 1 = 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 2. But if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a c\\), that would be 1 * 1 = 1. So, in this case, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384. But to make sure, let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second polynomial. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum over all k of 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\), which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, yes, 384 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would come from the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term in the second expression, which would include terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but without any specific \\(c\\) term. So, does that mean we're supposed to consider the entire expansion and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? Or is it that we're supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve multiplying by all the terms from the second expression. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But since the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), each term in the second part will contribute a different power of \\(c\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems a bit more complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we can treat the second part as a constant factor when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that doesn't seem right either because the second part is not a constant; it's an expression in \\(c\\). Hmm, perhaps I need to approach this differently. Let me consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. Wait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the product, and we can treat \\(c\\) as a variable that's not involved in the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. That doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum of all the terms that result from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), that 6 gets multiplied by each term in the expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify. Hmm, maybe I need to consider that when multiplying the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of the coefficients of each term in the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the product as a whole, which would include all possible combinations of \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), as I thought earlier. But that seems too involved. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. The second part is a separate expansion, so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), which might not be what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the product, but without any specific \\(c\\) term, meaning that we can treat the second part as a constant. But that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't a constant; it's an expression in \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I need to think of it differently. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting a numerical coefficient, but that's not possible because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps it's a misread, and the problem is actually \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\), but no, that's not what's written. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems more plausible. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, and perhaps the problem expects a numerical value. But I don't think that's possible because \\(c\\) is a variable. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand the product, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, and any \\(m\\) in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But wait, \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too high. Wait, no, because each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for all \\(m\\). Therefore, it's \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 384, but that seems incorrect because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that includes \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, which includes terms with \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient would be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), each multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number, so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms. So, that would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. Hmm, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But in that case, the answer would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, the term where \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) multiply to give \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, in that case, we would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when the exponents from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out. That happens when the number of \\(c\\) terms minus the number of \\(1/c\\) terms equals zero. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when we have an equal number of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. That would be when we choose 3 \\(c\\) terms and 3 \\(1/c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product would be the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering only the constant term in \\(c\\) is 120. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe that's the answer. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that seems more involved. However, given that the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number, I think the intended answer is 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the constant term in \\(c\\). So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of each part separately. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   To find the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we look for the constant term.

    "text": " Maybe I can just consider the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and then see if the second part affects it. Wait, no, because the entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), but that seems confusing because every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will involve some power of \\(c\\). Wait, but when we multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term is only from the first part, and the second part will contribute a term that doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term from the second expansion, the only way the resulting term is \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the term from the second expansion is 1, so that it doesn't add any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me check if I did that right. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 as the constant term, so when you multiply them together, you get 6*20=120. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the entire expression being the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part. Yeah, that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\).

So, when I expand both parts, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can just take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, maybe the coefficient remains the same? Wait, that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Let me think again. Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by, say, \\(c^6\\) from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), that would give me \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not any specific power of \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion multiplied by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). Wait, that might not be correct because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384? But that seems too high. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me check again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but is that correct? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each of those terms will have different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 * 64 = 384\\). But that seems high. Wait, is that the right approach? Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two expansions. So, when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but wait, that seems too straightforward, and I feel like I might be missing something. Let me check another approach. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, when I expand the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, as each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, another way to think about it is that in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every possible term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to compute the expansion step by step. First, compute \\((a + b)^4\\). As I did before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The expansion of this is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in this expansion has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c\\) of \\(6 - 2k\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 * 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being the product of the coefficients from each expansion, since the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 0 because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but that's because the second expansion is only to the first power. Hmm, maybe my approach is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, in the original problem, the second expansion is to the 6th power, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would create terms with various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion times the coefficient from the first. Wait, but in the example I just thought of, \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 0, because the second expansion only goes up to \\(c^1\\) and \\(c^{-1}\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2\\), the term \\(a^2\\) would be multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present because \\(b^2\\) would require two \\(b\\) terms, which in the first expansion only has up to \\(b^2\\). Wait, maybe my example isn't the best. Let me try another approach. Let me compute the product step by step. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, when I take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and multiply it by each term in the second expansion, I get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(20a^2b^2\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the term \\(a^2b^2c^{...}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so to get a term that only has \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to multiply by the term that has \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, is the problem asking for the coefficient in the entire product, so yes, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), and that requires multiplying by the constant term from the second polynomial, which is 20.

Then, for the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I correctly found that the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20. Multiplying these together gives 120, which should be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part, then multiplying them together.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
