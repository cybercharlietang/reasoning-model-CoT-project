Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But in this case, since I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant, i.e., doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it.

So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I find that? Again, using the binomial theorem.

So, solve \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). That gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by 20.

    "text": " So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second part for the terms that don't involve \\(c\\). Wait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), maybe the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, you would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, but the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so we need the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the power of 0. So, in other words, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is what we're interested in. So, let me focus on that. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part (which has coefficient 6) gets multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part (which has coefficient 20). So, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 for \\(c^0\\), so when you multiply them, you get 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient should be 120. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Because sometimes when you have products of expansions, you have to consider all possible ways to get the term, but in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion with the \\(c^0\\) term from the second expansion.

Wait, no, that can't be right because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that seems too big. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in \\((a + b)^4\\), the corresponding term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be any term because it's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too high. Wait, no, I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me clarify: when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first polynomial, the second polynomial's terms are multiplied by it, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the second polynomial's terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term contributes its own coefficient, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me check another approach. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the rest comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient for the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term. Wait, but no, because when you expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) is the one where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) balance out. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that makes more sense. So, earlier I thought the coefficient was 6 times the sum of all coefficients, which was 64, but that's incorrect because only the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) (i.e., the constant term) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by, say, \\(c\\), then the term would be \\(a^2b^2c\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term in the second polynomial would, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Let me verify this. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms like \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But only the constant term (20) will result in \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have additional factors of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they won't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the final product. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Wait, is that right? Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), the coefficient of a specific term in \\(P\\) times any term in \\(Q\\) would just be the coefficient in \\(P\\) times the entire \\(Q\\).

So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), which are terms involving \\(c\\). So, in the product \\(P \\times Q\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product only when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(Q\\). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).

Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients from each part contribute to the overall coefficient. Wait, but in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the overall expression would have terms involving \\(c\\), but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all the terms from the \\(c\\) expansion. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's considering only the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those coefficients would contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, and then multiply that by 6. So, let me check that. So, first, I can expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. That would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the term where the exponent is zero, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the constant term is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term (i.e., the term without \\(c\\)) of 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, but only the constant term will give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then I would have to consider a different term from the \\(c\\) expansion, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's safe to assume that they're considering the term where the \\(c\\) part is 1, i.e., the constant term.

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the term in the second part that is a constant (i.e., no \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms) because that's the only term that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) will still result in a term that's \\(a^2b^2\\).

So, does that mean the coefficient is 6 times 64? That would be 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which in the product would include all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But in terms of just the coefficient, without considering \\(c\\), it's the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, multiplied by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient being the product of the coefficients from each part, but since the second part's expansion has multiple terms, each contributing a coefficient, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Let me think of it differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6\\(a^2b^2\\). Then, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to a sum of terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), so each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when you multiply 6\\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, you get terms like 6\\dbinom{6}{k}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion.

Wait, but let me double-check my reasoning. Another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial gives the coefficient for that term in the product.

    "text": " So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that constant term, you still have \\(a^2b^2\\) as the term. Alternatively, perhaps the entire coefficient is 6, and the other part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms that don't include \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we can consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, no, actually, that's not correct. Let me clarify: The expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which are terms involving \\(c\\). But since the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's actually the sum of the coefficients of all the terms that result in \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term contributes a coefficient, and all those coefficients add up to the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, to find the total coefficient, I need to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, let me compute \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems high. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), when you multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the \\(c\\) polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expressions, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) part, which is 64, so 6*64=384. But let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But no, because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) part. So, yes, 6*64=384. Wait, but maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2. Then, when you multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get 6a^2b^2 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient of 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Wait, but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion. Because each term in the \\(c\\) expansion contributes its coefficient to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied. So, the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion is 64, so 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient being 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are just along for the ride, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term in \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, I think 384 is correct. Wait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have (a + b)^1 times (c + 1/c)^1. Then, (a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c. The coefficient of a^1b^0 would be c + 1/c, and the coefficient of a^0b^1 would be c + 1/c as well. But in this case, if I'm looking for the coefficient of a^1b^0, it's (1 choose 0) times the sum of coefficients in (c + 1/c)^1, which is 1*(1 + 1) = 2. But in reality, the coefficient is c + 1/c, which is 2 when c=1, but as an expression, it's c + 1/c. Wait, so maybe I'm confusing the concept here. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product is just 6, because the c terms are separate, and the a^2b^2 term is multiplied by each c term, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2, regardless of c, it's actually the sum of all coefficients that come from multiplying a^2b^2 by each term in the c expansion. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the c expansion, which is 6*64=384. Therefore, the answer is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is just 6 because the c terms don't affect the a and b terms. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in a and b is multiplied by each term in c, so the coefficients do get multiplied. So, I think 384 is correct. Let me try another approach. Let's compute the entire product and see. But that might take too long. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the problem as two separate parts: the a and b part, and the c part. Since the a and b part is independent of c, the coefficient of a^2b^2 is just the coefficient in the a and b expansion times the entire c expansion. But when you're looking for the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product, it's the coefficient in the a and b part times the sum of all coefficients in the c part, because each term in the c part contributes to the a^2b^2 term. So, yes, 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives us 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

Wait, no, that might not be the case. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second polynomial. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the answer is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which isn't possible because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since the second part only involves \\(c\\), when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but that seems like it would result in a sum, not a single coefficient. Wait, no, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply, each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we're only considering the term where \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Ah, that makes sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by 6. So, let's find that coefficient. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120.

Wait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second.

But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. When you have two separate expressions multiplied together, like \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of the first will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that makes sense because when you multiply by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), you're effectively scaling that term by the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can substitute \\(c = 1\\). Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into the expression will give me the sum of the coefficients. Let me try that: \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you have two expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), every term in the second expression will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is indeed 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient should be 384. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15\\dfrac{1}{c^2}\\), \\(6\\dfrac{1}{c^4}\\), and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). When you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, right? Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\). So, actually, every term in the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, that would indeed be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but now I'm confused because if I think of it as a product, then \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in every term, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each expansion. Wait, but that's not quite right because each term in the product is a combination of terms from both expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, as before. So, I think 384 is the correct answer. Let me double-check my calculations. First, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) when \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all coefficients. So, multiplying 6 by 64 gives 384. Yeah, that seems right. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion can be found by substituting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   Since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6 and the sum of the coefficients in the other expansion is 64, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that any term involving \\(c\\) would just be multiplied by 1, because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient, not considering \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and the exponents of \\(c\\) could be anything. But that seems odd because typically, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, you're considering all variables. Wait, but maybe the problem is only concerned with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, and the \\(c\\) terms are just along for the ride. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider the entire expression, and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Hmm, that might make more sense. So, in other words, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem to align with the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a constant. That might make sense. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. It could be interpreted in two ways: either (1) the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or (2) the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times the term where \\(c\\) has a specific exponent, perhaps zero, making it a constant. Since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the first interpretation is correct: we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But then, the coefficient would be 6 times each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a function of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, it's probably a number, not a polynomial. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then considering the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Wait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). That doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a constant. Let me try that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That seems plausible. Let me check that logic. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\text{some terms}\\), then when I multiply them, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, considering all variables. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numbers. So, perhaps the problem is only interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. That way, the coefficient would be a number. Let me proceed under that assumption. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Once I have that, I can multiply them together to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6. Then, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), is 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem had been asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), that would be a different story, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the intended answer is 120. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Next, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The term with \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\). Multiply these two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120. I think that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. So, I'm confident that the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).

So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to find that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (the term without \\(c\\)) from the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 20, so 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"
