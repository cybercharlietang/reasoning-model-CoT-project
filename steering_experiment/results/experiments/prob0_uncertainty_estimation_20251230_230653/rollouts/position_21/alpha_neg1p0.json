    "text": " So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not quite right either. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, because when you multiply by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes its own coefficient, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term, the total coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. But the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) times 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems plausible, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, and the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), then the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again: when you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second expansion adds its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the second expansion is being considered as a separate polynomial, and since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only in the first part, then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 is 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me check another way. Maybe I can compute \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and see what the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives us terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 6. Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) (which is 6a^2b^2) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the coefficients in the second expansion are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), and the sum of these coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, if I didn't consider the sum of coefficients, and instead thought that each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient, then when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those coefficients adds to the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yes, it's 6 times 64, which is 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from both expansions:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " But since we're looking for a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and not \\(c\\), the \\(c\\) terms must somehow cancel out. Wait, but the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the \\(c\\) terms are part of the expansion, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms will contribute a factor that's multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, that's not correct. The entire expression is a product of two separate expansions. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will contribute terms that involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other polynomial, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean we're summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. Now, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would have coefficients multiplied by those terms. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean we're considering the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that seems odd because the coefficient of a term in a polynomial is typically a scalar, not another polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second polynomial would contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the entire polynomial Q(c), because each term in Q(c) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in c, not a scalar. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the coefficient as a scalar, meaning that we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, which would imply that we're looking for the term where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\) times some terms in c. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, which would be the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, the coefficients add up. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. Then, we need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, if we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of a, b, and c are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. But the problem doesn't specify anything about c, it just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in c, but the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating c as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in c. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try another approach. Let me consider the entire expansion. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in c, which seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the c terms, meaning that we can treat the second part as a constant. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial in c. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in c, not a scalar. So, perhaps the problem is expecting just the scalar coefficient, meaning that we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve terms where the exponents of c cancel out, i.e., where the power of c is zero. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\) would be the term we're interested in. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, let's proceed with that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, we get \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of c to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, multiplying this by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6, we get 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. The term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire polynomial \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which seems unlikely. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, considering all the possible \\(c\\) terms? Wait, but that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the expansion would still have \\(c\\) terms. Wait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\).

But wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a term like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit strange because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would just be 6, because the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't make sense either because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. But then again, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe it's 6, because each \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the entire second polynomial. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second polynomial, which would include all the \\(c\\) terms. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be a term like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something}\\), where \"something\" comes from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think again.

But then the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a single number. Hmm, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check another approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2 respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make sense because then we're looking for a specific term in the product. So, in that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together. That sounds more plausible. So, let's try that approach. First, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find that, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, we multiply the coefficients from each part: 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120. Wait, that makes more sense. So, the key was to realize that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which comes from the second polynomial. So, the answer should be 120. Let me just double-check that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we look for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0.

But the problem is just asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's considering the entire expression, but I'm only interested in the part that's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, its coefficient in the product would be the coefficient in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. Wait, that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But since the product includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a sum of terms from the second polynomial, each multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial. Wait, that makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. That is, when you multiply the two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. But that seems odd. Wait, let me clarify. The product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a number; it's a polynomial. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). So, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient of 20 for \\(c^0\\). So, when you multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me go through it again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply the two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but only the term where \\(c^0\\) will contribute to the constant term in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Wait, but actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because when you multiply by the \\(c\\) terms, they just add more variables, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) part can be treated as a constant because it's not affecting the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial would be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Perhaps the problem is to consider the product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second factor, the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial, because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, each of which has a coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I would get the sum of the coefficients. Let me check that: \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the logic is: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial would be the coefficient of that term times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial. Because each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so when you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you're effectively summing all the possible coefficients from the second polynomial. So, if the second polynomial's sum of coefficients is 64, then 6 times 64 is 384. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being 6, and then each term in the second polynomial is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply 6 by each of those coefficients, you get 6 times each coefficient, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial. Wait, but is that accurate? Let me think again. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c, 1/c), then P(a, b) * Q(c, 1/c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in P would be multiplied by each term in Q, which are terms like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire Q(c, 1/c), but that doesn't make sense because the product would have terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) for various k. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from Q(c, 1/c), because each term in Q contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in Q(c, 1/c). Since the sum of coefficients in Q is 64, then 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me expand both parts separately and then see how they multiply. First, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\), where k goes from 0 to 6. The coefficients here are \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\). So, the sum of these coefficients is 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64, which matches what I found earlier. Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent, then the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is the term where \\(c^0\\), which is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Because when k=3, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients. Instead, I should only consider the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because that's the only term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Hmm, so which one is correct? Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's just 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that can't be, because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, maybe I misinterpret the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But then, when I thought about it earlier, I considered that \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the product would have terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. But when I calculated the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial by substituting \\(c = 1\\), I got 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But then, when I considered only the term where \\(c^0\\), I got 120. So, which one is correct? Let me clarify the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k=2\\) in the first polynomial, which is 6a^2b^2, and then this is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which are \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\) with coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, but that would be the case if we're considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Hmm, the problem statement doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 384. But earlier, I thought that maybe only the term where \\(c^0\\) contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\), but that's not the case because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second polynomial, you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any \\(c^k\\). Wait, no, actually, in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But I'm a bit confused because when I first thought about it, I considered only the term where \\(c^0\\), which gave me 120, but that's only if we're looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Since the problem doesn't specify any \\(c\\) term, I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. Wait, but that seems too large. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's (a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c. The coefficient of \\(a\\) is c + 1/c, and the coefficient of \\(b\\) is c + 1/c. But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's c + 1/c, which is 2 when c=1, but that's not the case here. Wait, but in this small example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is c + 1/c, which is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient as a number, which would require knowing the power of \\(c\\). Since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I'm supposed to consider the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient is 120. So, maybe I was overcomplicating it earlier. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Let me confirm that. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first polynomial, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second polynomial when k=3, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). So, multiplying 6 by 20 gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we consider the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the coefficients in the second expansion are not just numbers; they involve \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms involving \\(c\\), you might get terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, meaning just a constant term. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" Hmm, it just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering all the terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in that expansion. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But let me think about it: the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so it's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all the \\(c\\) terms. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it differently. The product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be considered as two separate expansions multiplied together. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times each term in the second expansion, which isn't a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be a single number. So, let's proceed under that assumption. Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. To do this, I can consider that each term in the product is a term from the first expansion multiplied by a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and to get \\(c^0\\), we need a term from the second part that is \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, let's calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, that's correct. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these two, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120. But wait, in the problem statement, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, maybe I was wrong earlier, and the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), as I thought earlier. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a bit odd because the coefficient is usually a single number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is intended to be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's considering all terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial, but the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, so I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), \\(b^4\\). Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each of these terms will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) specifically (i.e., the term where \\(c^0\\)) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6*20=120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but to confirm, let me think about the entire expansion. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each of these coefficients, but if we're only interested in the term where \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120. So, that's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion, which would be a polynomial, but that seems unlikely. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nSo, in summary, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0.

Let me approach it differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is entirely in terms of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the result will be terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we're looking for the terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by 1, meaning the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term that has a \\(c\\) in it, it would change the term to something involving \\(c\\), which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. So, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so 6 * 20 is indeed 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply the two polynomials, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we're looking for the term where the product doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, which is exactly the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Wait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, considering all possible terms, but that would require knowing the specific term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\).

But that doesn't make sense because the problem expects a numerical answer. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me check again: it says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the product, but since \\(c\\) is another variable, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part, but only for the specific terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., where the exponent is zero. Wait, that might make sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would mean that in the expansion, we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be \\(6\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense because then the coefficient would be a numerical value. So, let me proceed with that understanding. So, first, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply these two parts, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (specifically \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the steps are: 1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. 2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)), which is 20. 3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that makes sense. Alternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient when considering the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\).

We want the term where the exponent is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that would be 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is zero, which happens at \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yeah, that seems correct.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplies each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), that is, terms that don't involve \\(c\\) at all. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a bit confusing because that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), so perhaps it's 6 multiplied by the entire expansion, but that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression, and the coefficient is a number, but that can't be because the expression includes \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so maybe the problem is considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, in the product, each term would be of the form \\(a^kb^l c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^l c^{-m}\\), and we're to find the coefficient for the specific term where \\(k=2\\) and \\(l=2\\), regardless of \\(m\\). But that doesn't seem right because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would actually be a sum over all possible terms in the second expansion. Wait, no, that can't be because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients from each expansion. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think carefully. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose product gives that term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial by every term in the second polynomial \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire expansion of the second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are constants. Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me clarify: when you have a product of two polynomials, each term in the product is a term from the first polynomial times a term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial will multiply each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), depending on the term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't what the problem is asking for. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first polynomial, which is 6, and the second polynomial's expansion is separate, so the overall coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems off because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by \\(c^0\\) from the second polynomial. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the middle term when the exponent is 0. Let me check that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is given by the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product will have a coefficient equal to the product of the coefficients from each part. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, multiplying these together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the answer should be 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when you multiply the two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but only the term where \\(c^0\\) will contribute to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. That seems correct. Let me check the binomial coefficients again. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(k=3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Yeah, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, the total coefficient for a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will contribute all its terms.

Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\).

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, each term in the second part is being multiplied by each term in the first part. But since the first part's \\(a^2b^2\\) term is a standalone term, when multiplied by each term in the second part, it would produce terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero. Wait, no, that's not correct. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, every term in the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient when you consider all the terms that result in \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second part, each term contributes a coefficient, and since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of the \\(c\\) part, the total coefficient would be the product of the two coefficients.

Because each term in the second polynomial is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{coefficient} \\times c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. Wait, but that seems a bit odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second polynomial. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all those coefficients for each \\(k\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that when you multiply the two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) dependence, that would only occur if the second polynomial has a term with \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is not \\(a^2b^2\\) unless \\(k=0\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by 6. Let me find that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well. It would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, so that's different from the 384 I thought earlier. So, I must have made a mistake in the first approach. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term from the second polynomial. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first polynomial, when you multiply it by the second polynomial, each term in the second polynomial will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only consider the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, in the product, each term is a combination of terms from both polynomials. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only consider the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything. Wait, no, that's not right either. Actually, in the product, each term is formed by multiplying a term from the first polynomial by a term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second polynomial. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\), but that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term without \\(c\\). Wait, no, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the product, but when multiplied by the second polynomial, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. Wait, but that's not correct because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number. I think I'm getting confused here. Let me try a different approach. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find this, I can consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will produce terms of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{term from the second polynomial}\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only consider the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Because in the product, each term is a combination of terms from both polynomials. So, to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), you have to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes its coefficient to the product term. So, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But earlier, I thought it was 120. So, which is correct? Let me check again. If I consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. But another way to think about it is that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only one term, and when multiplied by the second polynomial, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, 6 times 64 is 384. But wait, let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes its coefficient to the product term. So, yes, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But earlier, I thought that the constant term in the second polynomial is 20, and 6 times 20 is 120. So, which is correct? Let me clarify. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then it's 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively, then it's 120. But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a bit ambiguous. It could mean considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\), which would be 384, or it could mean the coefficient when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which would be 120. Hmm, perhaps I should check the problem statement again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. But in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^lc^m\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only exist if \\(m = 0\\), because otherwise, it's \\(a^2b^2c^m\\). Therefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. Therefore, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. I think that makes sense because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial by the constant term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Yeah, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by all terms, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Wait, no, actually, the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since the problem is asking only for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is for the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that won't have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) when multiplied. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and then it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would multiply the 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 term, effectively scaling it by the coefficient of that term. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term would have a coefficient and a power of \\(c\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) term. Wait, that doesn't make sense because in the product, each term would be something like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient when multiplied by 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. But wait, that would imply that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems high. Wait, let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on the \\(c\\) term, but the problem didn't specify any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would involve only the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me try that approach. So, first, I have \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives me 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. Then, I have \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). I need to find the constant term in this expansion because that's the only term that, when multiplied by 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, will give me a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms. So, how do I find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\): \\(6 = 2k\\) \u21d2 \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the constant term is 20. So, going back, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)), which gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Let me just verify that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two polynomials together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only consider the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\).

So, the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expression, but that might not be right.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first part, and the second part is being multiplied as a whole, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that doesn't sound right because the second part is a Laurent polynomial, and its coefficients are in terms of \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, because each term in the second expression is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But wait, actually, no, because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Let me check that. The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all terms. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, and the second part is multiplied as a whole, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but let me verify this. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and the \\(c\\) terms are irrelevant, so the coefficient is just 6, but that doesn't seem right because the second part is being multiplied as a whole. Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the second polynomial's expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), then the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when you multiply these, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm correct. Let me check by expanding both parts. First, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. It's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients of each term in this expansion are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, when I multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're considering the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. So, I think the answer is 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but no, the problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's the sum over all \\(c\\) terms multiplied by 6. So, yes, 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply to give that term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6*64=384. So, yes, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have (a + b)^2 * (c + 1/c)^1. Then, the coefficient of a^2b^2 would be 1 (from a^2b^2 in the first part) times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is (c + 1/c), so sum of coefficients is (1 + 1)=2. So, the coefficient would be 1*2=2. Let me check: (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2. (c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c. So, the product is (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c). The coefficient of a^2 is 1*c + 1*(1/c) = c + 1/c, but if we're only looking for the coefficient of a^2, it's just 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 2. So, the coefficient of a^2 is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of ab would be 2 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 4, and so on. So, in this example, it works. Therefore, in our original problem, the coefficient of a^2b^2 is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but in the example, the coefficient of a^2 is 1 times 2, which is correct. So, yes, in our problem, the coefficient is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product is the product of the coefficients of a^2b^2 in each part. But no, that's not correct because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine in a different way. Wait, no, actually, in this case, since a^2b^2 is only in the first part, and the second part is being multiplied as a whole, the coefficient is indeed the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part. So, 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials: P(a, b) and Q(c). So, P(a, b) = (a + b)^4, and Q(c) = (c + 1/c)^6. Then, the product is P(a, b) * Q(c). So, when you multiply them, each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the term a^2b^2 in P is multiplied by every term in Q, which is a Laurent polynomial in c. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product would be the coefficient of a^2b^2 in P times the sum of all coefficients in Q, because each term in Q is a coefficient times a power of c, and when multiplied by a^2b^2, it contributes to the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product, regardless of the power of c. Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in Q is when we set c = 1, which is (1 + 1)^6 = 64. So, the coefficient is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have P(a, b) = a^2b^2 + ... and Q(c) = c^6 + ... Then, the product would have terms like a^2b^2c^6, a^2b^2c^4, etc. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product would be the sum of the coefficients of all terms a^2b^2 multiplied by any power of c. But since we're only asked for the coefficient of a^2b^2, regardless of the c terms, that would mean we're summing over all possible c terms, which is equivalent to multiplying the coefficient from P by the sum of coefficients from Q. So, yes, 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient of a^2b^2 is 6, and the coefficient of c^0 in Q(c) is the middle term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) = 20. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2c^0 would be 6*20=120. But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2, not a^2b^2c^0. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the entire product, regardless of the c terms, then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c), which is 6*64=384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2c^k for some specific k, then it would be different. But the problem doesn't specify any c terms, so I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't mention anything about c, so it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the c terms. So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the example I thought of earlier, where P(a, b) = (a + b)^2 and Q(c) = (c + 1/c), the coefficient of a^2 is 1 times the sum of coefficients in Q, which is 2, so 2. Similarly, in our problem, it's 6 times 64=384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of the entire product as a product of polynomials in different variables, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but let me consider another approach. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve c, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all variables, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve c. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the answer is simply 6, but that can't be right because the second part is being multiplied, so the coefficient should be scaled by the number of terms in the second part.\n\nWait, but no, because each term in the second part is a separate term when multiplied by the first part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, let me try to think of it another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. The sum of the coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. So, yes, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the multinomial theorem, but in this case, since the variables are separate, it's simpler to consider the product as the product of two independent polynomials, so the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms that multiply to give that term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, which has coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\), which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me calculate the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k=0\\) to \\(6\\). That's equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\), so yes, 6*64=384.\n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe I can just consider the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but no, that's not right. Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a term with some power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because each term in the second expansion affects the coefficient. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Now, when you multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we're looking for all terms where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts are squared, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, but when multiplied by the second polynomial, each term would have a different power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, no, that's not correct. Because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when you set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64 \\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, is that correct? Let me check. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) alone would imply \\(c^0\\), since the other terms have \\(c\\) involved. Wait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's referring to the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, as I thought earlier, giving 384. But let me verify this because I might be making a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the expansion is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6a^2b^2, as before. Now, when you multiply this by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get 6a^2b^2c^k for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that it's considering all possible terms where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents are 2, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the middle term. Wait, no, because the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). So, actually, in the product, each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, leading to multiple terms with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), each with their own coefficients. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the coefficients from each of these multiplied terms. Wait, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term, but in the product, it's multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), so each of those would be separate terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second polynomial contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. In that case, I would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Let me check that.\n\nSo, if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as before. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but this contradicts my earlier conclusion of 384. So, now I'm confused. Which interpretation is correct?\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". The problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. But in algebraic expressions, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, it's usually considering the term with that exact combination of variables, including their exponents. So, if the term is \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, that would imply \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as I calculated in the second approach.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this. If the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\), then in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), each with their own coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. But now I'm getting conflicting answers depending on the interpretation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient would then be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second polynomial contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The expansion is \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). Now, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), so the coefficient is \\(c + 1/c\\). But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it would be the constant term from \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2, so the coefficient would be 2. So, in that case, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a\\) in \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), it would have been \\(c + 1/c\\), but if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) times \\(c^0\\), it would be 2.\n\nTherefore, in our original problem, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. So, I need to determine which interpretation is correct based on the problem statement.\n\nLooking back at the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". Since the problem includes both \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), it's possible that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is meant to be a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), i.e., \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a separate entity, and the \\(c\\) terms are just part of the overall product, so the coefficient would be 384. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) with each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, each term in the product would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6, because each term in the second polynomial contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. Since the problem doesn't specify the power of \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for an authoritative source or example. In algebra, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, it's usually considering the term with that exact combination of variables, including their exponents. So, if the term is \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, then it's \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), and the coefficient would be 120. If the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\)\" for some \\(k\\), then it would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it refers to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Expanding this, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The term \\(ab\\) in the first polynomial would multiply each term in the second polynomial, resulting in \\(ab c\\) and \\(ab (1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is 2 when \\(c = 1\\). But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(ab c^0\\), that would be the constant term from the second polynomial, which is 1, so the coefficient would be 1 * 2ab = 2ab, so the coefficient is 2. Wait, no, in this case, the coefficient of \\(ab c^0\\) would be 2 * 1 = 2, because in the second polynomial, the constant term is 2 when \\(c = 1\\), but no, wait, in the example, \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), so the constant term is 0 because there is no \\(c^0\\) term. Wait, that's a problem. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(ab c^0\\) would be 0, because there's no constant term in \\((c + 1/c)\\). So, maybe my earlier approach was wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that when you're asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you're looking for the coefficient in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120, as before. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, giving 384.\n\nWait, but in the example I just thought of, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product would be \\(c + 1/c\\) times 2, because in \\((a + b)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2. So, the term \\(ab\\) in the product would be \\(2ab(c + 1/c)\\), so the coefficient is \\(2(c + 1/c)\\). But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(ab c^0\\), that would be 2 * 0, because there's no \\(c^0\\) term in \\((c + 1/c)\\). Wait, that's not correct because \\((c + 1/c)\\) does have a \\(c^0\\) term when considering the product, but no, actually, \\((c + 1/c)\\) doesn't have a constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(ab c^0\\) would be 0. Hmm, this is getting more confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me think of the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) in the product would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of \\(c\\). But that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term; it's multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving 120.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be part of the product, and its coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each polynomial. But in reality, each term in the product is a combination of terms from both polynomials. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check with a smaller exponent to see if this makes sense. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is 2 when \\(c = 1\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), not 2. But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a c^0\\), that's the coefficient of \\(a\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 0 because there's no constant term in \\((c + 1/c)\\). Wait, but in reality, the term \\(a c^0\\) would require that \\(a\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is zero. So, the coefficient of \\(a c^0\\) is zero. But if I'm just looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's \\(c + 1/c\\). So, in this case, the problem is ambiguous.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial with each term from the second polynomial. Therefore, each term in the product would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of \\(c\\). But that's not a standard interpretation because each term in the product has specific exponents for all variables. Therefore, the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the problem is treating \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) as the only variables and considering \\(c\\) as a coefficient. But that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is a variable, not a coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that \\(c\\) can take any value, but that doesn't make much sense either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example where I can compute it manually. Let's take a smaller exponent: \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). So, expanding this, we get \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(ab\\), it's \\(2c + 2/c\\). If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(ab c^0\\), it's 0 because there's no \\(ab\\) term without \\(c\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product is \\(2c + 2/c\\), while the coefficient of \\(ab c^0\\) is zero. Therefore, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in this product, it would have been \\(2c + 2/c\\), but if it had asked for the coefficient of \\(ab c^0\\), it would be zero.\n\nTherefore, applying this to our original problem, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's likely referring to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as calculated earlier. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it would be 384. But given the structure of the problem, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I consider that the product is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product only when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, it would have a \\(c\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm still not entirely sure. Let me try another approach. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and each term from the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term, it's only multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in reality, each term has a different power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is not a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without any mention of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the intended interpretation is that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, I'm going in circles here. Let me try to decide. Since the problem includes \\(c\\) terms, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But this would mean that the coefficient is 384, which is a constant, not a polynomial. Therefore, that must be the intended answer.\n\nWait, but in reality, when you have a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because that's the only term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, I'm so confused. Let me try to look for a definitive approach. The coefficient of a specific term in a product of polynomials is found by multiplying the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we can think of it as the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial by \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), we can ignore the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part because when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion. But that can't be right because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering any specific term from the \\(c\\) part. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are variables, I think we're supposed to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that might not make sense because each term would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms. But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the product as a whole, but treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's a product of two polynomials, and we're to find the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the product, each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and any term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, when multiplied by any term in the second polynomial, the result will be \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems off because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's treating \\(c\\) as a variable independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's just written as \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and ignoring the \\(c\\) parts, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that also seems odd. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, meaning that we can ignore the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems more plausible. Wait, let me think. The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when multiplied by any term in the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. The sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, as I calculated earlier by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. But wait, let me think again. Is that correct? Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from the first part (6) times the sum of all coefficients in the second part (64), which gives 384. That makes sense because each \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by every possible term in the second polynomial, effectively scaling the coefficient by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, I think that's the correct approach. Let me just verify with a smaller example to make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). The product would be \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that's not helpful. Maybe a better example: Let's take \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The product is \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no such term. Hmm, maybe my earlier reasoning is correct because in the product, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms come from the first polynomial, and the \\(c\\) terms come from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first polynomial, and when multiplied by the second, it's \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems to suggest that the coefficient is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something like that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we can ignore the \\(c\\) part when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that doesn't make much sense because the \\(c\\) terms are part of the product. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would be a polynomial, not a number. I'm a bit confused here. Let me try another approach. Let me consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. So, in other words, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when all \\(c\\) terms are set to 1, which would make the coefficient 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and ignoring the \\(c\\) parts, so the coefficient is just 6. But that seems too simplistic. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. That means that in the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the way it's written, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, let me check that again. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is more straightforward. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the rest of the terms come from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term. Because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense as a single coefficient. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, let me try that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as before. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 120. But wait, the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm supposed to consider all possible terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But then, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense as a single coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the product of the relevant coefficients from each part of the expression. \n\n1.

Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4 = A + B + C + D + E + ...\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = F + G + H + ...\\), then the product is \\(A \\cdot F + A \\cdot G + ... + B \\cdot F + B \\cdot G + ...\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But let me double-check.

The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply by the entire expansion, each term would contribute to different terms in the product. Wait, no, that's not right. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, in this case, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) would give the sum of its coefficients. Let me calculate that: \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Because when you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which is 6 * (some polynomial in c). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without c. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. In that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That changes things. So, in that case, I need to consider how \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part interacts with terms in the second part that result in \\(c^0\\). So, let's re-express the problem: find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as before. Now, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), because when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), we want the term where the exponents of c cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of c to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for k: \\(6 - 2k = 0 \\Rightarrow 2k = 6 \\Rightarrow k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was under a different interpretation of the problem. So, which one is correct? The problem says: \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". Now, the way it's written, it's possible that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is considered without any c terms, meaning \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, I think the correct interpretation is that we need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Let me confirm that. Alternatively, if the problem had meant the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, it would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in c, but that's not the case here because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, implying a specific term. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that we need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the answer should be 120. Wait, but let me double-check my steps. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. So, I think the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that results in \\(c^0\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).
