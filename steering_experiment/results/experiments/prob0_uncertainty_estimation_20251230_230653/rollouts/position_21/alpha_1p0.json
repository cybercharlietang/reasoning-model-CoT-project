    "text": " So, maybe I need to consider all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) must be the constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if I take any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that's not a constant, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would give a term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) which is 6. So, first, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So that's 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me double-check. Is there any other term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\((a + b)^4\\)? No, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is purely in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so any term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) wouldn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the only contribution comes from the constant term in the \\(c\\) part. So, the coefficient should be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed when \\(k = 2\\), so \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), that's correct. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is zero is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), that's also correct. So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. I think that's the right answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.

    "text": " So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, actually, the \\(c\\) terms can be anything, because we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) part. That means that the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the entire expansion would include multiple terms with different exponents of \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the \\(c\\) part can be anything, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like a lot, and I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should treat the \\(c\\) part separately because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables. Wait, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the coefficient. So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems high. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, which includes both \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) terms. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part, but only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out or something? Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. Let's first expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately. For \\((a + b)^4\\), as I did before, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. Now, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get a product where each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, that means that in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each contributing a coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the second expansion has terms with different exponents of \\(c\\), so their coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each \\(k\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because it's multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times 64, which is 384. But let me think again. When you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the overall coefficient. So, that would make it 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two separate coefficients, but that doesn't seem right because the second part is an expansion with multiple terms. Wait, no, the first part has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply them, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, each contributing their own coefficients. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would just be the product of the coefficients from each part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate variable. Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me check with an example. Let's say I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because the first term only goes up to \\(a^1b^0\\) and \\(a^0b^1\\). So, in that case, it's zero, which makes sense. But in our problem, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has 7 terms. So, when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we consider the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

But that seems more complicated, and the problem didn't specify, so perhaps it's just a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because otherwise, the coefficient would include terms with \\(c\\). Hmm, that might make sense. So, if I consider that, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. That makes more sense. So, let me approach it that way.

So, first, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when you expand the entire product, considering all the terms. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times whatever the coefficient is for the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion, that's the only term that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6 to get the final coefficient. Let me check that logic again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, but that's multiplied by every term in the \\(c\\) expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) which is \\(6a^2b^2\\) and multiplying it by the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term of 20.

So, that might be the case. Let me check that.

Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was because I considered the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, and multiplied by 6. But that would be the case if we were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), we need to consider only the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nLet me verify this with an example. Let's expand both parts:\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when \\(k = 3\\), we get the term \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, when we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But only the term with \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have some power of \\(c\\), so they won't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the entire product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then we're only interested in the terms where \\(k = 0\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) (which is needed to combine with \\(a^2b^2\\) without introducing \\(c\\) terms) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\).

    "text": " Wait, no, in this case, the expression is the product of two separate expansions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the variables are independent. So, when you multiply them, the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from the terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient remains as 6, and the rest is multiplied by the expansion of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these out, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that coefficient would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, but that can't be, because the problem is just asking for the coefficient, not considering \\(c\\). Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the coefficient for each \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, which would make it a constant. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, let me proceed under that assumption. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the product of the two coefficients we found, it would be 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me double-check the steps. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made a mistake here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\).

So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is a separate polynomial, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second polynomial.

So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should check if that's correct by expanding both parts. Let me see. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), as I said, has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).

Is that the correct approach? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term in the second polynomial would multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second polynomial, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me check with a small example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\), and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2.

That would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 as the constant term, so when multiplied together, it's 6*20=120. That seems right. Alternatively, if I think of the entire expression as a product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but no, actually, only the constant term contributes because other terms would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the term not purely \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, it's 6*20=120.

Wait, no, that can't be right either because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times a term involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems too broad. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve terms with different powers of \\(c\\), which isn't specified. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would make the problem more precise. So, let's assume that's the case. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, to do this, I can consider the product of the expansions. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, as I found earlier. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), I get \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) from the other expansion has a coefficient of 20, the combined coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So, the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps we need to sum all the coefficients where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\), which would involve multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a bit ambiguous. It might just be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), as I thought earlier. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 120. Alternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is 6 times that expansion. But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of each part separately and then combining the relevant coefficients.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion.\n   - Coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   - We need the constant term (\\(c^0\\)), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n   - The exponent is \\(6 - 2m\\), so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\).\n   - Coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   - The combined coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But that seems off. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Hmm, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's just the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\).

So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, so 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is presented as a single expression, perhaps the answer is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to treat \\(c\\) as another variable and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the other part, which is 6*64=384. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two expressions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But if the problem is just asking for the coefficient, perhaps it's expecting a numerical value, which would require summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because then the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term. Let me check that possibility. If that's the case, then I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, and then multiply it by 6. So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that would be the answer if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, meaning the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but if it's asking for a numerical coefficient, maybe it's expecting 120. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me re-examine the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any condition on \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if we're treating the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But if the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's assuming that we're only considering the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), i.e., the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me think again. In the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when you expand it, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, this is multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any restriction on \\(c\\), then the answer is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because usually, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term without specifying other variables, it's assuming that those variables are treated as constants, or perhaps it's expecting a specific term. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to see if I can find any examples or similar problems. Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times that expansion, meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but if we're to express it as a coefficient, it's 6 times the expansion. But that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. I think I need to decide which interpretation is correct. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only, and treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely as an answer. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, so it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6*20=120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384. Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me think about how the product would look. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\\). So, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's this entire expression. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6*20=120. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion, which would be a polynomial. But since the problem didn't specify, I think the most reasonable interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that seems unlikely because the answer would be a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, to summarize: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6*20=120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me actually compute \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the exponents of \\(c\\) will be 6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6, corresponding to \\(k=0,1,2,3,4,5,6\\). The coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}=1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}=6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}=15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}=20\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}=15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}=6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}=1\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is indeed 20. Therefore, when we multiply by 6, we get 6*20=120 as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion, which would be 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}), but that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), and I don't think that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nSo, I think the intended answer is 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the final answer is 120.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Suppose I consider the entire product as a product of two independent expansions. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), with coefficients from the binomial coefficients. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), with coefficients from the binomial coefficients. When I multiply these together, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then that's the answer. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6*20=120.\n\nBut the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is 6 times the entire expansion, but that's a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, I think the problem must be expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, when I multiply these two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find all the terms in \\((a + b)^4\\) that are \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply them by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the product would involve terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^4\\), etc., but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Now, what's the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, let's compute \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine in a specific way. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 = A + B + C + \\dots \\) where each term is a combination of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\( \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = D + E + F + \\dots \\) where each term is a combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), then the product would have terms like \\(A*D\\), \\(A*E\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, each contributing their own coefficients. So, yes, that would make the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, I could think of it as the entire product being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by evaluating it at \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means when we expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient is just the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because each term in the expansion would have different powers of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each would contribute a different term. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we can consider the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a single term when multiplying by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me try to clarify. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., depending on the expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term without any \\(c\\) factors. Wait, but that's not possible because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you'll always have some power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no term without \\(c\\) when multiplied? That seems odd. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression, and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms from the other expansion, so the coefficient would be the sum of all those products. Wait, but that would be the case if we were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would be the product of the coefficients from each expansion. But I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let me consider the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, as we found, with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, unless we are looking for a specific power of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a scalar. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we're to consider all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which is not a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would result in a polynomial where each term has a different power of \\(c\\). But the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which usually implies a scalar, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some specific power of \\(c\\), but it's not stated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we're to sum over all possible \\(c\\) exponents. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), but that seems off. Wait, let me think again. The sum of the coefficients in a binomial expansion \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, if we consider the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion, but that's not a single number. I'm getting confused here. Let me try to clarify the problem again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} \\times c^m / c^n\\), but when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're looking for all terms where \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), so that's just the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part. Now, this term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a scalar. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 times 64 is 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion, but that's not a single number. I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let me consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and then it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each expansion. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) would be when the exponents cancel out. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 20, which is 120. That makes more sense. So, I think I was overcomplicating it earlier. The key is that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part and then multiplying them. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The constant term occurs when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, which happens when \\(m = 3\\).

So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the part of the first expansion, right? Because the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so it doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't matter because they won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I'm looking for a specific term in the product, like \\(a^2b^2\\), then that term would be the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and some term from the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the term from the second part would just be a constant, right? Wait, no, that's not correct. Because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(1/c^2\\), etc., but none of these affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right either. Let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that only comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have multiple terms, each of which is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (coefficient from second part) \\(\\times c^k\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct either because each term from the second part would contribute separately. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify this. Let me denote the first part as \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(B = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, the product is \\(A \\times B\\). Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is just a single term with coefficient 6, as I found earlier. When I multiply this by each term in \\(B\\), each term in \\(B\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in \\(B\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Therefore, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(B\\), I get \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\) for each \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\)? Because each term in \\(B\\) is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. So, in other words, all the terms that result in \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) part. But wait, no, that's not how it works because each term in \\(B\\) is a separate term. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(A \\times B\\) would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), so the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) times the entire expansion of \\(B\\). But that seems a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term independent of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\(A\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\), since each term in \\(B\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in \\(B\\) is a separate term. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(B\\), you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (term from \\(B\\)), which would be terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) or any other power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that there is no such term as \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) in the product? Because \\(B\\) is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, only has terms with positive and negative exponents of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(B\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but not \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be zero because there's no term without any \\(c\\) attached. Wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for it, so perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe I'm supposed to consider that \\(c\\) is a variable, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the product regardless of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is another variable. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, but only focusing on the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, and not worrying about \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant. Hmm, I'm getting confused here. Maybe I need to approach this differently. Let me think: the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would come from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part. But since the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the second part would contribute a coefficient that is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^{something}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from the second part. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Because when \\(c = 1\\), \\(c + 1/c = 2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems high, but maybe it's correct. Let me check. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, another way to think about it is that in the product, each term is a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by plugging \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64 \\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me confirm by another method. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the specific power of \\(c\\), the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.

    "text": " So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a numerical value, not an expression with \\(c\\) in it. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression multiplies each term in the second expression. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific term involving \\(c\\), maybe I need to consider that the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right either because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not a sum. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some term in \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify any term involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, in the entire expansion, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, and what is its coefficient, irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, and thus its total coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems plausible. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c^k\\), it would result in \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I'm wrong earlier. Maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. So, in that case, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by 6, which is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). So, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that makes more sense because otherwise, if I multiplied by the sum of all coefficients, which is 64, I'd get 384, but that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by every term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the constant term in the second expansion. So, I think 120 is the correct answer. Let me verify this by considering the entire expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens at \\(k = 3\\). Thus, the constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
