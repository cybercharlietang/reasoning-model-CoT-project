So, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms will just contribute a factor that's multiplied by 1, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it comes from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and then multiplying it by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. Because if I take any other term from the second part, like \\(c^k\\), then the term would involve \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), which would make the entire term have a \\(c\\) component, but we're only interested in terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), so the \\(c\\) part must be 1, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I've already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we multiply the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120.

Multiplying these coefficients together, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

So, when you multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find how the multiplication affects the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and when we multiply it by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems off because each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) parts. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only present in \\((a + b)^4\\), and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the terms don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean that we're only interested in the terms in the second expansion that are constants, i.e., terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part. So, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that the coefficient is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the second part has terms with \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first expansion, specifically from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), and it will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for the coefficient, implying a numerical value. Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's possible that the problem is treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\) as variables, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, usually, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a specific term, it's in the context of variables that are being multiplied, but here, \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because usually, coefficients are constants. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in a context where \\(c\\) is being treated as a constant, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Wait, let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when I multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of the coefficients of all terms \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But that's not a single coefficient; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that we can treat the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) as a single term. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply polynomials, each term is multiplied by each term. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a constant. So, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, perhaps the problem is written in a way that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term, and we're to find its coefficient, regardless of the other variables. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, but \\((a + b)^4\\) contributes a coefficient of 6 to \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes its entire expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). So, that would mean we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion. That would make the coefficient a numerical value. So, let me proceed under that assumption. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we've already determined is 6. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If we treat \\(c\\) as another variable, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part, because only the constant term in the second part doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). Any other term in the second part would introduce a \\(c\\) term, making it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only way to get a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second expansion. So, that means the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I expand both parts separately and then multiply. The first expansion gives me terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). The second expansion gives me terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^5(1/c)\\), which is \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^3(1/c)^2 = 15c\\), \\(20c^2(1/c)^3 = 20/c\\), \\(15c(1/c)^3 = 15/c^2\\), \\(6(1/c)^4 = 6/c^4\\), and \\((1/c)^6 = 1/c^6\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me actually calculate the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) properly. Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) are \\(6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6\\) corresponding to \\(k=0\\) to \\(k=6\\). So, the constant term is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which is at \\(k=3\\), as I found earlier, and that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). Therefore, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) appears multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) is to the zero power. So, that would be \\(6a^2b^2\\) times the constant term 20, giving \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way \\(a^2b^2\\) could appear without involving \\(c\\). For example, if there's a term in the second expansion that cancels out the \\(c\\) terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), there's no way for the \\(c\\) terms to interact with \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The general term in the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   To find the constant term (\\(c^0\\)), set the exponent of \\(c\\) to 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both parts:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Because if the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, then it's just a constant, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but only the constant term (20) will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product, because any other term would involve \\(c\\) raised to some power, which would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, but since the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), we only consider the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well if the variables match. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's like saying we're looking for the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and the constant term in the other expression. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120.

Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we can treat the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a single term because when we multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would just be a coefficient multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). So, in order for the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to have a term \\(a^2b^2\\), the other part must contribute a term that is \\(c^0\\), that is, a constant term.

Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.

That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120.

    "text": " But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and not \\(c\\), that means that the coefficient from the \\(c\\) part can be any term because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms would just contribute their coefficients, but since we're only looking for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, perhaps the \\(c\\) part can be considered as a single term? Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient from the \\(c\\) part would just be the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right either because the \\(c\\) terms would be separate. Let me try to clarify this. Suppose I have \\( (a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4 \\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), we need to find what happens when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion. However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expansion involves \\(c\\) terms, which are different variables, the product \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any \\(c^{k}\\) term would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^{k}\\), which is a different term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by all the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply them together, the terms will involve combinations of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). But the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we need to find all the terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any other term involving \\(c\\), you'll end up with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is some integer, but the problem is only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which has no \\(c\\) part. Therefore, the coefficient we're looking for is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let's compute that. We already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, let's look at the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I wrote earlier, it's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). We need to find the term where the exponent is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\times 1 = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Let me just double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 for the constant term. Multiplying these together gives 120. That seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which happens when \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.

Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so when you multiply these two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expression.

Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. When you have two products, say \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of a specific term in \\(P(a, b)\\) would just be multiplied by the entire \\(Q(c)\\).

Wait, that seems contradictory. Let me try to clarify.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, that means that in the product, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Because then, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 1 (the constant term), you get \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, I need to find two things: 1) the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6, and 2) the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, I can multiply these two to get the final coefficient.\n\nAlright, so let me tackle the second part: finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, the constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) => \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, correct. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, yes, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is if we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part.

But that seems a bit confusing. Wait, no. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second. But since the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\), which is different from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire sum of the coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. When you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, which are terms involving \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that term must have all the \\(c\\) terms multiplied by it. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not an expression in \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) terms. But the way the problem is phrased, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we're considering the product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me reread the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that we're looking for all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a bit strange because it's not a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire product as a single polynomial and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would still involve \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and wants the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make more sense. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, to find that, we can proceed as follows: First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (considering the \\(c^0\\) term) is 120. Wait, but let me double-check. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), or specifically when multiplied by \\(c^0\\)? Because if it's regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is not a number. But I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense in this context. So, I think 120 is the correct answer. Let me just go through it again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Wait, no, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will have different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), perhaps the only term that contributes is the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because any other term would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, making the entire term have \\(c\\) dependence, which we don't want. So, actually, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, that makes more sense. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, but only the constant term (20) will contribute to the term without \\(c\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product of two expansions, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, then the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part.

Because when you multiply two terms, one from each expansion, their exponents add up. So, to get \\(c^0\\), you need a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, let's first find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384? Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct because maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the rest of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not right because each term in the product will be a product of a term from each part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely confident. Let me check another way. Alternatively, maybe I can treat the entire expression as a product of two polynomials and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can come from only one term in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6\\(a^2b^2\\), and then multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As before, substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me think differently. Maybe I can consider that \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term 6\\(a^2b^2\\), the product will have terms like 6\\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum over all m of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because the \\(c\\) terms are multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all binomial coefficients for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of binomial coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, another thought: maybe I'm supposed to consider that \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are variables, and the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, yes, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then I would have to compute it differently. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, so 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a sum of coefficients equal to 64 when \\(c = 1\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, is that possible? Or maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). Hmm, that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not quite right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a specific power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you'd have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the coefficients from each \\(c^k\\) term multiplied by 6. Wait, but that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. If that's the case, then I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the term is 20c^0 = 20. Now, going back to the original product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was assuming that we're summing all coefficients, which would be the case if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's considering the entire product, and \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be the sum over all possible \\(c^k\\) terms multiplied by 6. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the product would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from each \\(c^k\\) term multiplied by 6. So, if I take 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively, which would be 120. I'm a bit confused now. Let me think again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That would mean that in the expansion, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to this coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems like a lot. Alternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Let me check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Since it doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that in the product, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to this coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think about this differently. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, it would have mentioned something about \\(c\\). But to be sure, let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any power for \\(c\\), so maybe it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would make the coefficient 384. But that seems counterintuitive because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, you're considering each variable separately. So, perhaps the intended answer is 120, where \\(c^0\\) is assumed. Let me try both approaches.\n\nFirst approach: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). So, 6 * sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSecond approach: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the second approach, where we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the answer would be 120.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me compute both possibilities.\n\nIf the answer is 120, then the coefficient is 120.\n\nIf the answer is 384, then the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut given that the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the intended answer is 120, because it's more precise. So, I'll go with 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n$\\boxed{120}$"

So, actually, the \\(c\\) terms will just be coefficients for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so when we multiply it by a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), that term must be a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) to not affect the \\(c\\) exponent. Otherwise, the product would have a \\(c\\) term, which we don't want. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Again, we can use the binomial theorem for this. Let me write that out: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\): that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), which seems correct. Then, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), looking for the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) leads to \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which also seems correct. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, so that should be the coefficient.

Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that's \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct. I don't think I missed anything here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then I need to consider all possible ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term from the first part, and the second part is a separate expansion, the total expression is the product of the two expansions. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because then the coefficient would involve terms with \\(c\\), but the original problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the \\(c\\) part is irrelevant here because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct either because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's actually the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. If I have two expressions, \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the product \\(A \\times B\\) is a polynomial where each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(B\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(A \\times B\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(B\\), which has coefficients, the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the original coefficient multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). So, that makes sense. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I find that? Well, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), because that makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(B\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(A \\times B\\) is 6 (from \\(A\\)) multiplied by 64 (from \\(B\\)), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check that again. Is that correct? So, if I have \\(A = a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\) and \\(B = \\text{terms with coefficients}\\), then when I multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), each contributing their coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from \\(A\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(B\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. That seems right. Let me double-check my steps. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, find the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) by plugging in \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64. Multiply 6 * 64 to get 384. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Substitute \\(c = 1\\) to get:\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " But since we're only interested in terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part? Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, as I found earlier. Then, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate expansion. When I multiply these two expansions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficients add up. So, the total coefficient will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I should get the sum of the coefficients. Let me compute that: \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I can approach it differently. Let me consider that when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6a^2b^2, and when I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 6. Now, when I multiply 6a^2b^2 by each term in the second expansion, I get terms like 6a^2b^2 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can think of this as 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) times \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\), but since we're only interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero (because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\)), we need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\): \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) \u2192 \\(2k = 6\\) \u2192 \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k = 3\\) in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that's different from my earlier result of 384. Hmm, so now I'm confused. Which one is correct? Let me check both approaches.\n\nIn the first approach, I considered the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, and multiplied it by 6 to get 384. But in the second approach, I found that only the term where \\(k = 3\\) contributes to \\(c^0\\), and that term is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach. Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is to multiply it by the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the correct coefficient is 120, not 384. So, my first approach was incorrect because I mistakenly multiplied by the sum of all coefficients, which would be the case if I were looking for the constant term in the entire product, but in this case, since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. So, that would make the coefficient 120. Let me confirm this with another method.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6a^2b^2, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it becomes 6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's only if we're considering the entire expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a multiple of \\(c\\) raised to some power, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only include the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., where \\(k = 0\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the sum of coefficients is 64, but that's when you set \\(c = 1\\), which gives the sum of all coefficients. But in this case, we only need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, I think the correct answer is 120. Let me check this again.\n\nIn \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is 6, and in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. All other terms will have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they won't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I had to consider the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. But that's only if I were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), which isn't the case here. Here, we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate term, the \\(c\\) part has to be \\(c^0\\), so we only take the coefficient where \\(c^0\\), which is 20, and multiply by 6. So, 120 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is it possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? But in that case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term, so the coefficient would be spread across different terms in the product, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only include the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to take 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of it as the product of two independent expansions. The first expansion is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in terms of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms are cross-multiplied, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, that's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I had to compute the entire expansion, I would have to consider all possible cross terms, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we only need the part where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The term \\(ab\\) would come from \\(a \\times b\\), but in this case, there's no \\(ab\\) term because each factor is separate. Wait, no, in this case, each term is either \\(a \\times c\\), \\(a \\times 1/c\\), \\(b \\times c\\), or \\(b \\times 1/c\\). So, there's no \\(ab\\) term in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be zero. Similarly, in our problem, if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first expansion, and when multiplied by the second expansion, each term in the product would have some power of \\(c\\), so the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is to multiply it by the term where \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but in the example I just thought of, if I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), there is no \\(ab\\) term because each term is either \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) multiplied by a \\(c\\) term. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is zero. But in our problem, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first expansion, and when multiplied by the second expansion, each term would have \\(a^2b^2\\) times some \\(c^k\\). So, the only term that would have \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is when \\(k = 0\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to collect like terms, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product as \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\), so its coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which are terms involving \\(c\\). So, the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to a term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but if I were to compute the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, to find this, I can use the multinomial theorem or consider the product as separate expansions. Alternatively, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, that would be the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents match. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to consider generating functions, the generating function for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the generating function for \\(c\\) is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first generating function and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second generating function, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when I multiply them together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\) in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need the term where \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nSo, after all these considerations, I think the correct coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, i.e., \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then I need to consider that term in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't sound right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a term with different powers of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each of those terms. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so actually, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but is that correct? Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and it gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, no. Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those coefficients becomes part of the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient times \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem statement doesn't specify, it just says \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. So, that means we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would be the sum over all possible \\(k\\) of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\). But since we already found that the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, then the total coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. And as I calculated, the sum of coefficients is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me think differently. Maybe the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so perhaps the answer is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, but that would be a series of terms, each with different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384. Wait, but let me verify this with another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible combinations with \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). In that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the middle term. Let me calculate that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I'm confused now. Wait, perhaps I should read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It says \"in\" the product, so it's considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) would be the sum over all possible coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, in that case, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me think about how the problem is phrased. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, when you expand it, you'll have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that for each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient is multiplied by 6, and then all those are added together. So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), I think it's the former, 384. Wait, but let me think again. If you have an expression like \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), then when you expand it, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be the sum of all those coefficients. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384. But to make sure, let me calculate the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by considering the expansion of each part separately and then combining the results.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient from this part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."
