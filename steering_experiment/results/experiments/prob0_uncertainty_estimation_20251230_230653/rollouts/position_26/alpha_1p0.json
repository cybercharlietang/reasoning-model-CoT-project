So, yes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, if I were to multiply out the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from selecting two \\(a\\)s and two \\(b\\)s from the four factors of \\((a + b)\\), and then from the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part, selecting terms that don't involve \\(c\\), which as we saw is the middle term when expanded, with coefficient 20.

So, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by the constant term in the second polynomial, the overall coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find all the ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). That is, only the term where the second polynomial contributes a constant term. Because any other term would have a power of \\(c\\), which would make the entire product have a \\(c\\) term, which we're not interested in. So, yes, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Let me check my calculations again. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is 0, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficients from each part of the expression. In \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term's coefficient is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Let me work on the second part now. The expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\).

Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think about it another way.

So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first part and the constant term is from the second part, their product contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.

The expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) implies \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.

So, 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the term in the second expansion that doesn't have any \\(c\\) to multiply it by. That term is the constant term, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Hmm, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6, because 4 choose 2 is 6. And \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, because 6 choose 3 is 20. So, yes, 6 * 20 is 120.
