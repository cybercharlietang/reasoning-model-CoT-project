    "text": " Because if you take any other term from the second polynomial, it would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would come from the term where \\(k = 0\\). So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6, the coefficient from the first part. Let me check that logic. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we want only \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, we need the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to compute the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that's 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) times 20 (from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two separate coefficients because the variables are independent. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part and the constant term is in the second part, their product would indeed contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall expression.

So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense. So, I need to find two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6. 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that second part. So, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the term where the exponent is 0, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by 20 (from the \\(c^0\\) term). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, \\((a + b)^4\\) coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 is 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made any calculation errors here.
