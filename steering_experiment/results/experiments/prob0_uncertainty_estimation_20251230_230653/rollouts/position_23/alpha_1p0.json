So, that would mean I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when \\(k = 0\\), \\(c^0 = 1\\), so that term would just be \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let me calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That is, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), has a term \\(20c^0 = 20\\). So, when you multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, if I think about the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would indeed be the product of the two coefficients, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) part. So, yeah, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the two coefficients:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that when multiplying \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), other terms could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? For example, could a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) with \\(a^1b^3\\) multiplied by a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with some \\(c\\) exponent lead to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, no, because when you multiply variables, you add exponents. But \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so their exponents don't interact. So, any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have exponents only in \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will remain as they are in \\((a + b)^4\\). Therefore, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think my initial reasoning is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me just verify that I didn't make a mistake in calculating the constant term. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when \\(m = 3\\), we have \\(c^{6 - 6} = c^0 = 1\\), so the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That seems right. And the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), which is correct. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6, the coefficient from the first part. Let me check that. So, let me first find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and a term \\(c^k\\) from the second part, then the product will be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that any term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product only when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by a term from the second part that is \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) in it. So, actually, only the term where the second part contributes a constant term would result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). So, my initial thought was correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the entire expansion. Let me try another approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and any term from the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\), that means we have to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second part. So, that would be the only contribution. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple variables, you might have cross terms, but in this case, since the two parts are multiplied together, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), then any term from the second part that has \\(c^k\\) would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but if we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), then we need the term where \\(k = 0\\), which is the constant term. So, that's why we only consider the constant term from the second part. So, I think my initial calculation is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the entire expansion. Let me see. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\), that means we only consider the term where the second part contributes a \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct. Let me just double-check the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 is indeed 120.

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think I need to consider all possible \\(c\\) terms and sum their coefficients. Wait, no, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only a term in the first part. So, when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part.

So, when you multiply them, you get \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120. But wait, is there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by a \\(c\\) term? For example, if I have a term with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and then another term with \\(c^{-k}\\), would that combine to give \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, no, because in the product, each term is a product of terms from each polynomial. So, if you take a term from the first part and a term from the second part, their exponents add. So, if you take \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^0b^0c^{-k}\\), then their product would be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, that would require that the second part has a term with \\(c^{-k}\\) such that \\(k\\) is the exponent from the first term. But in our case, we're only taking one term from each expansion. So, in the first expansion, we take \\(a^2b^2\\), and in the second, we take \\(c^0\\). Alternatively, if we take other terms, like \\(a^1b^3\\) from the first expansion and multiply by \\(c^{-1}\\) from the second, that would give \\(a^1b^3c^{-1}\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\).

But that can't be right because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials.

Wait, but the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in this case, setting \\(c = 1\\), the sum of the coefficients would be \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\).

In that case, I would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, and then multiply that by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). So, first, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, as I found earlier. So, when we multiply the two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought maybe it was 384, but that was when I considered the sum of coefficients, which is different. So, I think I was confused earlier, but now I realize that the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient. So, going back, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would make the coefficient a Laurent polynomial. But that doesn't seem right because the problem is likely expecting a numerical value. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 times 20, giving 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). So, let me calculate that.

But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one polynomial and \\(c\\) is in the other, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second.

    "text": " Because if I take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by, say, \\(c^k\\) from the second part, the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, I need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we have terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct. I don't think I missed any steps. So, yeah, the coefficient should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting the exponent of \\(c\\) to zero, giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together yields \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Because if I take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part that has \\(c\\) in it, the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that, which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would give me a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me check that. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, but only for the terms that don't involve \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think that term must come from \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the product of 6 and 20, which is 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. Because when you multiply the two expansions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second expansion, giving \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, if I consider the entire expression, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 from \\((a + b)^4\\) and 20 from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by determining the coefficients from each part and multiplying them. \n\n1.
