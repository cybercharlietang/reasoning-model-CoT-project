So, the coefficient should be 120. I think that makes sense. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything.

    "text": " Because if you take \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is some exponent. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. So, I think that's the case. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this part. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

So, 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20. When you multiply them, you get 6 * 20 = 120, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me think again. The first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 for the constant term, so when you multiply these together, you get 120. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't overlook anything. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion of the first part is multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by all the terms in the second part, but we're only interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that term is 20, as I found. So, yes, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two coefficients because the terms are independent. So, yeah, 120 should be the correct coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nAnother way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first polynomial and the constant term is only in the second, their product will give the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's solid.

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so when multiplied together, it's 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, if I were to expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since we only care about the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only the term where the second part contributes a constant term.

That makes sense because when you multiply the two polynomials, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these two terms, you get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is the product of two polynomials, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only contribution comes from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term in the second part.
