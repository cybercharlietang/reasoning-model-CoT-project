    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Wait, actually, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to worry about the other variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Hmm, let me think. So, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), any terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) would just be coefficients themselves, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it becomes 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 times the entire expansion. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the problem is likely asking for a numerical coefficient, not involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is the product of the coefficients from both expansions. Wait, no. Let me clarify: The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). But since this is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering all possible coefficients from the second expansion and just wants the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), treating the other terms as coefficients. Wait, that might not make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by the second expression, the coefficient would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Wait, perhaps the problem is actually a product of two separate expansions, and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the expansion, and its coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That might make more sense because otherwise, if we're only considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, which would be a polynomial, not a single coefficient. So, perhaps I need to interpret the problem as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms, which the problem isn't asking about. So, let me proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nFirst, I can separate the two expansions because they are multiplied together. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWe already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term: \\(c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. Multiplying these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the expression also includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is part of the first part of the product, right? So, does that mean the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first part, I need to consider how it interacts with the terms from the second part. But wait, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the result will be terms that include \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean that only the constant term from the second part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\) (the constant term), that would give me \\(a^2b^2\\). If I multiply it by any other term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that would change the variables, so those wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I just need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient 6 from the first part. That makes sense. So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0 because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) => \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these are multiplied together, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the entire expansion and see if there's any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). But no, because any term from the second part that isn't constant would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the term have variables other than \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):** The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):** The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens at \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:** \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is a product, so when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number.

But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would be a polynomial. But perhaps the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that might not make sense because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion. So, actually, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when we set \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 * 64 = 384? Wait, but that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is separate, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's 6 multiplied by the entire expansion, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6. But that seems too simple.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, so that would mean the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by whatever comes from the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, as I thought earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, let me try to verify this. Let's consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) has the term \\(6a^2b^2\\). When we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will multiply the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is 64, and thus the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient becomes 6 times the sum of all those coefficients. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me try another approach. Let's expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. That would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Now, when we multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), the product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for each \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\), because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k=0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Is there a possibility that some terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) could affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)? No, because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, so they don't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are solely determined by the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) just multiply those terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but just to double-check, maybe I can consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients from \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which is 1 + 1 = 2, so the coefficient would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would also be 2. If I expand it, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c. So, the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are each 2, which is correct. So, applying the same logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but another thought: when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first factor, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first factor times the entire second factor. But that doesn't make sense because the second factor is a polynomial, not a scalar. So, perhaps I'm misapplying the concept.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. But that seems too simple, and I think I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify the question. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's 6 times the entire second expansion. But that can't be, because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the rest is separate. But that seems inconsistent with the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, perhaps it's just 6, and the rest is part of the term's coefficient in the product. Wait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning it's 6, but that seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). In that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that might make more sense. Let me explore that possibility. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6. Let's calculate that. \n\nUsing the binomial expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but the original problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. If the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because a coefficient is a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut then, another thought: maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I think of the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, it's the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6, but that seems too simple, and I think the intended answer is 384. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, let's consider the entire product: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we multiply these, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think differently: perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, meaning that it's the coefficient when you consider all the terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is part of the other terms involving \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because the product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial, which contradicts the problem statement asking for a coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nWait, but I think the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible exponents of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, but that's not a single number. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me check both possibilities. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. But since the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 384. Therefore, I'll go with 384 as the answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a sum of coefficients equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Okay, so that's 6. Now, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that this part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so maybe it just acts as a constant factor when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, actually, I think the entire expression is a product of two expansions, so maybe I need to consider how each part contributes. Wait, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the other part of the product can be evaluated separately and then multiplied by the coefficient we found from the first part. So, let me check that. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and since it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because each term in the product is the product of terms from each expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't a single term. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both, each term in the expansion of the first part is multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we're only interested in the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel each other out, so that the term is a constant, right? Wait, but actually, no. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when we multiply it by any term from the second expansion, it will have some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that it's looking for the term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so every term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that doesn't seem right either because each term in the product would be a combination of \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) and \\(c^m\\) or something like that. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the question is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem is phrased as asking for a single coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering all terms together, and \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that appears in the expansion, and we need to find its coefficient, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning that we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., a constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a single number. So, if that's the case, then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let's break it down into two parts: first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. Second, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the final coefficient would be 6 multiplied by that coefficient. So, let's work on the second part. The expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We can expand this using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but the original problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, maybe I need to consider that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that's separate from \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is phrased as asking for a coefficient, which is usually a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that's not standard. Hmm, perhaps I need to re-express the entire product and see how \\(a^2b^2\\) appears. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion would actually be \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of the second part. But that's not a single coefficient; it's a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That makes sense because then the coefficient would be a single number. So, going back to that, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. So, multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. So, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me check my reasoning again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. The term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that's not a single coefficient. So, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that's not a single number, so I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient when considering the product term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

I'm not sure if I need to consider this part when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it. Hmm, let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression.

Let me clarify: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply as well. But in this case, the first polynomial is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in terms of \\(c\\). So, the variables are separate. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part because \\(c^0\\) is 1, which doesn't change the term. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, 6 - 2m = 0. Solving for m: 6 = 2m => m = 3. So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the coefficient from the second part (which is 20).

But that still doesn't make sense because the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems more complicated, and the problem might not be expecting that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which would be the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Let me check that. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion would have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), in steps of 2. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term, then the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would give a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve multiplying by each term in the second expansion, but that would result in a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion with coefficient 6. Then, the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) in the second expansion is 20. So, when you multiply these together, you get 6 * 20 = 120 as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part of the product doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the second part for this particular term. Wait, let me think. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be affected by the second part. So, when we take the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second part. But wait, that can't be right because the second part is raised to the 6th power. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply it by the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part.

But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is being raised to the 6th power. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient will be the same as the coefficient in the first part, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems too big. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is being multiplied, so perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, let me check: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of coefficients in a binomial expansion \\((x + y)^n\\) is obtained by setting \\(x = 1\\) and \\(y = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Because when you have two independent polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first polynomial, so when multiplied by the second polynomial, each term in the second polynomial will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), each term in the second polynomial contributes its coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second polynomial).\n\nThe sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't seem right because the entire second part is being multiplied, so each term in the first expansion is scaled by the entire second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression multiplied by the entire second expression. But that seems too broad. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression, which are terms involving powers of \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Because each term in the second expression contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, the sum of coefficients in the second expression is indeed 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another approach. Let me expand both expressions separately and then see how they multiply. The first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\). The second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), gives terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), 1, \\(1/c^2\\), etc. But when we multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first will be multiplied by each term in the second, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient would be the same as in the first expansion, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, we would need to find the term where in the second expansion, the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because \\(c^0 = 1\\), so we need the constant term in the second expansion. Let me check that.\n\nIn \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second expression, which would be 6 * 64 = 384. But if the problem is considering only the term where \\(c^0\\) is present, then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem statement is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but I'm getting conflicting interpretations here. Let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's the former, 384.\n\nBut let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we have \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because in the first expansion, the highest power is \\(a^2b^0\\) or \\(a^0b^2\\), so you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) unless you have higher powers. Wait, no, in this case, the first expansion is \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present at all. So, the coefficient would be zero. But if I had \\((a + b)^4\\), then \\(a^2b^2\\) is present. So, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6, but when multiplied by the second expansion, which has 64 terms, each contributing a coefficient, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would still be zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present in the first expansion. So, in the original problem, since \\((a + b)^4\\) does have \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to consider only the term where \\(c^0\\) is present, so the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But I'm not sure. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but to confirm, let me think about how the multiplication works. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), which is 6 * (sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to 6). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k = 0\\) to 6 is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Or do I need to consider the entire product? Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. But since the first part has \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), which doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expression? But that doesn't make sense because the second part is raised to the 6th power, which would have multiple terms. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

But wait, that would mean that the coefficient isn't just 6, but 6 times something else. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the second part is being multiplied, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, they don't interfere with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part would contribute a factor that doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me try to clarify. When you have two separate products, like \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), the terms from each expansion multiply together. So, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, but that seems too simplistic. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). When you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that would only happen if the term from the second part is 1, i.e., the constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by 6 to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). Okay, so let's work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2k\\). We're looking for the term where the exponent is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(6 = 2k\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the constant term from the second part is 20, so when you multiply them, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire coefficient is 6 * 20, so 120. Hmm, that seems right. Let me recap: To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.

So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first polynomial, then when I multiply by the second polynomial, every term in the second polynomial will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct either. Because when you multiply by the second polynomial, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply by it, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing something here. Let me think differently. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so that would be the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be, because the entire expansion of the second part is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient is 6 times whatever the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\), so it's just 6. But that seems too simple. Wait, maybe not. Let me check. Let me consider that \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in this expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems plausible, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6, but that seems too simplistic. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would require considering all possible ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be formed when multiplying the two expressions. But since the second expression only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the first expression is \\((a + b)^4\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and it's independent of \\(c\\), so it's just 6. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you're effectively scaling the coefficient by the sum of the coefficients in that expansion. So, I think the correct approach is to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Let me verify this with an example. Suppose I have a simpler case: \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Indeed, expanding it, we get \\(a(c + 1/c) + b(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2c and 2/c, but if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 2. Similarly, in the given problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we consider the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), yielding \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these results gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product as \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has a second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is asking about \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does this second part affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), I think the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the product of the coefficient from the first part and the entire second part? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because the second part is raised to the 6th power, so it's a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we can treat the second part as a separate factor and realize that when we multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term of the second expansion. But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), we might actually need to find the term in the second expansion that is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Wait, no, that might not be the case. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But looking back, I think I might have misread the problem. Let me check again: the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But actually, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in the product will only come from the first polynomial, and the exponents of \\(c\\) will come from the second polynomial. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it doesn't matter what the exponent of \\(c\\) is, because \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second polynomial, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct either. Because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But wait, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that separately.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply the first expansion by the second, each term in the first will be multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, no, that's not correct because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, let me compute that.\n\nIf I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake here. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider all possible ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by a term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way it can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term that is \\(c^0\\), i.e., a constant term. So, actually, I was wrong earlier; the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, not the sum of all coefficients. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me compute that. As I wrote before, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the first part gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part has a term \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20, so when we multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving a total coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense because when you multiply two terms, their coefficients multiply.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of it another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would require that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so the first part contributes \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for the second part, we need to find all terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is anything, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we actually need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) such that the term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not right because the second expansion has different terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. So, perhaps I was correct earlier that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P multiplied by the entire Q(c), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 * Q(c), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. Wait, no, I think I'm confusing myself.\n\nWait, no, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{k}\\) would be 6 * \\dbinom{6}{m} where \\(k = 6 - 2m\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) such that the term is \\(a^2b^2c^{k}\\) for any \\(k\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But earlier, I thought it was 120. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it's part of a product that includes terms with \\(c\\). So, does the problem want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or does it want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\)? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any power of \\(c\\), which suggests that it's looking for the sum of all coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, you're looking for the coefficient when that term appears with a specific combination of variables. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, leading to 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the context of the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\). So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), which would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one set of variables is independent of the other variables. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so its coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial, which is a bit confusing because the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the entire second polynomial, but that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial is a function of \\(c\\). So, maybe the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, perhaps it's just 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nWait, I'm getting conflicting answers here. Let me try to resolve this. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the answer would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to see which interpretation makes more sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't seem right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, the correct interpretation must be that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since \\(k\\) isn't specified, perhaps it's considering all possible \\(k\\), which would mean summing over all coefficients, leading to 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two variables, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another variable \\(c\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nTherefore, the correct interpretation must be that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTo confirm, let me compute it step by step again. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), has a term \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. Therefore, when we multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, resulting in a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.

So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, that would be the case if we were combining like terms, but in reality, the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) would each have different powers of \\(c\\), so they wouldn't combine. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient remains 6. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Let's consider the product: \\((a + b)^4\\) gives terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives terms with \\(c\\). When you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. But wait, no, that's not quite right. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can think of it as the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only looking for the coefficient, not the entire term, it's just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Wait, but the second part's expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times a term with \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, let me calculate that. The coefficient from the first part is 6, as we found earlier. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, when we collect all such terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all those contributions, which is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part. Therefore, 6 times 64 is 384. So, the coefficient is 384. But wait, let me verify this with another approach. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the second part's expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), each of these terms, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the total coefficient is indeed 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and the sum of the coefficients in this expansion is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not involving \\(c\\). That makes me think that perhaps the \\(c\\) terms are irrelevant for this part, or maybe the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) part might just contribute a factor that isn't affecting the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The expression is a product of two expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps we can treat the second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Hmm, but that might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me approach it differently. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that seems confusing. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms from both expansions. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make more sense because then we're looking for a specific term in the product. Let me check the original problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Hmm, maybe it's just considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and ignoring \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient is usually a number, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible terms in the second expansion. But that might not be the case either. Let me try to clarify. Let's denote the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, it would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a function of \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be \\(6\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by 6. Let me compute that. Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\): \\(6 = 2k\\) \u2192 \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), so 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but we're only interested in the term where the power of \\(c\\) is 0, so that the resulting term is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6, but since the expression is a product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the entire second expansion, so the coefficient would actually be 6 times the entire second expansion, which would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so does this mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves \\(c\\), so maybe when we multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that term in the first part is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when we multiply it by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the result will be terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), where \\(k\\) varies depending on the term. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that means we don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all; we just need to find how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears when multiplied by any term from the second expression. Wait, but actually, each term in the expansion will have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part, then the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient just gets scaled by the coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because each term in the product will be a combination of the two expansions, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right either. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, which is in terms of \\(c\\), the resulting terms will have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself will only appear once, when multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Wait, no, because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't have a constant term. Let me check that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), stepping by 2 each time. So, the exponents of \\(c\\) will be 6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6. Wait, actually, when you expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\cdot \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which happens when \\(k = 3\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is the constant term, which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. But wait, the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of its coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that contradicts my earlier thought. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing something here. Let me clarify. When you have two polynomials, \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), their product is \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\). So, each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), the coefficient gets scaled by each coefficient in \\(Q(c)\\), and then you sum all those scaled coefficients. So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\( (1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64 \\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, earlier I thought it was 120. I'm confused now. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\( (a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 \\). Then, expanding, we get \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in \\(c + 1/c\\), which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 2. But if I set \\(c = 1\\), I get \\((a + b)(2) = 2a + 2b\\), which matches. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 2, which is 1 (from \\(a + b\\)) times 2 (sum of coefficients in \\(c + 1/c\\)). So, applying that logic here, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Therefore, the answer should be 384. But earlier, I thought it was 120 because I was considering only the constant term. I think I was mistaken because I was thinking that \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear when multiplied by the constant term, but actually, in the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But let me double-check this because I'm a bit unsure. Let me think of a simpler case. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which when multiplied by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^1\\) which is 1 for \\(a\\), gives the coefficient of \\(a\\) as \\(c + 1/c\\). But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that's not how it works. Wait, no, in the product, each term is a combination. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be the sum of the coefficients of \\(a\\) times each term in the second polynomial. Wait, but in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1, and the second polynomial has terms \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be \\(1 \\times (1 + 1) = 2\\), because the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is 1 (from \\((a + b)\\)) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second polynomial). So, applying that logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384. Wait, but let me make sure that I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the exponents of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, the coefficient gets scaled by each coefficient in the second polynomial, and then you add them all up. So, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64 \\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). I think that makes sense. So, the answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by considering the binomial expansion of each part. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem.

Wait, is that correct? Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're just interested in the coefficient, regardless of \\(c\\), that means we're effectively summing all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), as before. Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But no, that's not the case because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, it's actually the sum over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient would indeed be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Wait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Okay, so the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to expand this part as well. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because they are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, perhaps the entire expression is a product of two separate expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But wait, actually, no, because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So, maybe the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables. Let me think about this again.\n\nWait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only part of the first polynomial. The second polynomial is entirely in terms of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe they are considering the coefficient in the entire product, but only focusing on \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" Hmm, so perhaps the problem is considering \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, that would make sense because then we can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire product.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems a bit more involved, and I'm not sure if that's what's intended.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the entire expression as a product of two separate expansions. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion comes with a coefficient of 6, and then it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because the problem is expecting a numerical answer, not a polynomial. Therefore, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate expansion, so the coefficient remains 6.\n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a single number. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together.\n\nOkay, let's try that. So, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To do this, I can use the binomial theorem again. Expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering that \\(c^0\\) is 1, is 120.\n\nLet me just verify that again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but that doesn't seem right because the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer. So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Is there another way to interpret the problem? Maybe the problem is considering the entire expansion and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. So, that can't be right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number.\n\nTherefore, the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the product of the coefficients from each binomial expansion. \n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Hmm, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), right? So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again.\n\nActually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.

But wait, that can't be, because the entire expansion includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\), and the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because each term in the product would have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me clarify: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not quite right either because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not correct because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are not constants; they depend on the power of \\(c\\). Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me approach this differently. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, no, because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for each term, but that's not right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each of those terms, each with their own coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're just scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those coefficients, so the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be the same as evaluating it at \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\), then when I multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify this another way. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384, as before. So, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of two independent expansions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when the exponents cancel out. Wait, that might be a different approach. Let me explore that.\n\nIn \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, to get the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, now I'm getting a different answer. So, which one is correct?\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) or specifically looking for the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. But the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any condition on \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each with their own coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that contradicts the other approach where I found 120. So, which is it?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misapplying the concept. Let's clarify: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will have the form \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second polynomial. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because each term in the expansion has a different power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes its coefficient to the multiplication with \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut earlier, when I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), I found that the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, leading to 6 * 20 = 120. But that approach was considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a different term. The problem didn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the correct approach is to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in that expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still confused because when I set \\(c = 1\\), I get that the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems correct. But earlier, I thought of the term where \\(c^0\\), which gave 120, but that's only if we're considering the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term. The problem just asks for \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have two polynomials: P(a, b) = (a + b)^4 and Q(c) = (c + 1/c)^6. Then, the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms like a^2b^2 multiplied by each term in Q(c). So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product is indeed the coefficient of a^2b^2 in P(a, b) times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because each term in Q(c) contributes its coefficient to the multiplication with a^2b^2, resulting in a^2b^2 multiplied by each coefficient from Q(c). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut now, I'm questioning whether that's the correct interpretation. Let me check with a simpler example. Suppose I have (a + b)^2 * (c + 1/c)^1. Then, the coefficient of a^2b^2 would be 1 (from (a + b)^2) times (c + 1/c), so the coefficient of a^2b^2 is 1*(1 + 1) = 2, because when you expand, you have a^2b^2c + a^2b^2*(1/c), so the coefficients are 1 and 1, but the coefficient of a^2b^2 is actually the sum of these, which is 2. Wait, but in this case, the coefficient of a^2b^2 is 1*(1 + 1) = 2, which matches 1* sum of coefficients in Q(c). So, in this case, the coefficient is indeed the coefficient from P(a, b) times the sum of coefficients in Q(c). Therefore, in the original problem, it should be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, in the simpler example, the coefficient of a^2b^2c^0 would be 1*(coefficient of c^0 in Q(c)), which is 1*2 = 2. But in the product, the coefficient of a^2b^2 is 2, as I saw. So, actually, the coefficient of a^2b^2 is the same as the coefficient of a^2b^2c^0 plus a^2b^2c^2, etc., but in the problem, it's just asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2, which is the sum of all coefficients from Q(c) multiplied by the coefficient from P(a, b). So, yes, 384 is correct.\n\nWait, but in the simpler example, when I set c = 1, Q(c) becomes 2, so the product becomes (a + b)^2 * 2, so the coefficient of a^2b^2 is 2, which matches 1*2. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, in the original problem, setting c = 1, Q(c) becomes 64, so the coefficient is 6*64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still confused because earlier I thought of the term where c^0, which gave 120, but that's only if we're considering the term a^2b^2c^0. The problem didn't specify any condition on c, so it's asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2 regardless of c. Therefore, the correct answer should be 384.\n\nBut to make sure, let me think of another approach. Let's expand both parts separately and see.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, when I multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought of the term where c^0, which is when 6 - 2k = 0, so k = 3, and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify any condition on c, so it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all powers of c. Therefore, the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a concrete example. Suppose I set c = 1, then the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * (1 + 1)^6 = (a + b)^4 * 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I set c = 2, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(2 + \\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)^6\\), but that's not the case because each term in the expansion has a different power of c. Wait, no, that's not correct. When c is a variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as when c is a variable because we're treating c as a separate variable. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I conclude that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. When multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, I need to consider the product of these two expansions. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, actually, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific term involving \\(c\\), maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, no, actually, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that means I can treat \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a single term when considering the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because the product will involve terms from both expansions. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would only happen if the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Because if I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by a term involving \\(c\\), like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) is if we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, that means I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by 20, we get \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.

The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's being multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), their coefficients shouldn't be affected by the terms involving \\(c\\).

Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" Wait, perhaps the problem is considering all variables together, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times whatever the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is.

But the problem didn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

But that seems odd. Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a constant. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if we're looking for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\), but if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that's ambiguous. Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That seems plausible. So, let me check that. First, I'll find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in the other expansion). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, if we're considering the entire product, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} c^{6 - 2m}\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to \\(k=2\\), so the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and then we have to consider all terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that are multiplied by this 6. But if the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because coefficients are usually constants. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), setting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the intended interpretation. Wait, maybe I should think about the problem differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but without considering any specific power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial. But again, the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so maybe the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That makes sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, as I calculated earlier, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer is 120. Wait, but to confirm, let me think about the entire expansion. The product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be written as the product of two polynomials. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which isn't a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is considered in the entire product, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients from each polynomial that result in that term. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, as I calculated before. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), since \\(a^2b^2\\) alone is a term without any \\(c\\). So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would require that in the second expansion, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. Let me write it as \\((c + c^{-1})^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that makes more sense. So, earlier I thought it was 384, but that was considering all coefficients, but actually, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, we need the coefficient where \\(c^0\\), which is 20. Therefore, the correct coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Let me confirm this. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two parts, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.

To find the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial, I can substitute \\(c = 1\\). Let me do that. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (from the second part), which is 6 * 64. Let me calculate that: 6 * 60 = 360, and 6 * 4 = 24, so 360 + 24 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me double-check that. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Because if I'm looking for a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, then in the second expansion, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, making the term dependent on \\(c\\), which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me correct that. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the exponent to be zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so we can only pair it with the term where \\(c^0\\) is present. Therefore, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient from the second part is 20. So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was because I considered the sum of all coefficients, which is 64, but that's not correct because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only be paired with the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), not all terms. So, I think my initial approach was wrong, and the correct approach is to find the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is 20. Therefore, the correct coefficient should be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me think again. When I multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by every term from the second polynomial. However, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only term that will contribute to this is the term in the second polynomial that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because multiplying by any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), making the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure. Let me compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) again. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when is the exponent zero? When \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, yes, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. Wait, but earlier I thought the sum of all coefficients is 64, but that's not relevant here because only the constant term affects the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the correct coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"
