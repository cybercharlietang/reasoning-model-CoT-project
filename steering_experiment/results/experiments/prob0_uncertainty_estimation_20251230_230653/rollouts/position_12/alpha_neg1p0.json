    "text": " So, that part gives me 6 times \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I also need to consider the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the other part doesn't affect that term? Hmm, let me think. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second part evaluated at the terms that don't involve \\(c\\), but wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when multiplied by the first part, each term in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that can't be right because then the coefficient would be 6 times something, but I think I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. The entire expression is the product of two binomial expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, which is 6, as I found earlier. Now, when I multiply this by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first part gets multiplied by each term in the second part. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first part, the coefficient will be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients, which is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6\\(a^2b^2\\). When I multiply this by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, that would mean I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. That makes more sense.\n\nSo, to clarify, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product.\n\nAlright, so let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(k = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying these together, 6 times 20 is 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding this product, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since we're interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean we need to consider the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, no, that's not quite right because each term in the second expansion is a term in \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, right? So, that's why we needed to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion and multiply it by 6.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be different, but as it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 120.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another way to approach this. Maybe using generating functions. The generating function for \\((a + b)^4\\) is straightforward, and the generating function for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is as well. When you multiply them together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each generating function for the respective terms. But since the second generating function doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first generating function multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second generating function. Wait, no, that's not correct because the sum of all coefficients in the second generating function would be when you set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384, but that's not the same as 120. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, I think I'm confusing two different concepts here. The sum of all coefficients in the second generating function is indeed 64, but that's when considering all terms in \\(c\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire generating function of the second part, which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that's not the case because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my earlier reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would include all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that can't be right.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, in that case, the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, just to confirm, let me think of the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and to get \\(c^0\\), we need the term from the second part where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, which is when \\(k = 3\\), as I calculated earlier. So, yes, that gives 20. Therefore, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6, and the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but I'm not sure if the second part of the expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), affects this coefficient. Wait, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific term involving \\(c\\), maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That means I can treat \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part. Wait, that can't be right because the second part is a binomial expression as well. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the entire expansion, but since the problem is only asking about the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the \\(c\\) terms might not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But no, that doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are separate. So, actually, the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms when multiplying. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply by the entire expansion, the coefficient would become 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is not correct. I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me consider that when you have two separate polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when you multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient becomes \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I'm supposed to treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and just report the coefficient as 6, but that seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct either because the sum of coefficients would be when you set \\(c = 1\\), but that's not what's happening here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the sum of coefficients is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which would make \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and it will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be \\(6 \\times\\) the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is just 6, but that seems too simple.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's just 6. But that seems unlikely because the expression includes \\(c\\), so the coefficient should be in terms of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but it's not specified, so perhaps it's just 6. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply by the second expression, the coefficient becomes 6 times the entire second expression. Wait, but in the product, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, but that seems odd.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would mean considering all possible terms from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient; it's a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific term involving \\(c\\), but it's not specified. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a distraction. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6, and the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it. So, maybe the answer is 6. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve considering the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and multiplying it by 6. But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second part is a constant, but that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in considering the variables. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate and don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would just be 6, as that's the coefficient from the first part. So, maybe the answer is 6. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider the entire expansion and find the coefficient, which would involve more steps.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let's expand both parts separately and then multiply them. The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the expansion would have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is not a single number but a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion. So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me find that. So, from the expansion, the exponent is \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), multiplied by the constant term 20, would give \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 120. That makes sense because the constant term is 20, and multiplying by 6 gives 120. So, perhaps that's the answer.\n\nWait, let me check that again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two, you get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is not just 120 but 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe it's only considering the constant term in the second expansion. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), in which case the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that doesn't make sense because the sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which isn't the case here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's only considering the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, but that seems too simple.\n\nWait, let me think differently. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when you multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient becomes \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient is a polynomial and provide it as such. But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which implies a single number, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. In that case, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\), as the constant term in the second expansion is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 120. But the problem doesn't specify the exponent of \\(c\\), so maybe I'm supposed to consider all possible exponents, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is 6. But that seems inconsistent with the presence of \\(c\\) in the expression.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but not specifying any condition on \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would result in \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient is 6, but that seems incorrect because the entire second polynomial affects the coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of it differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as \\(6a^2b^2\\), and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient is a polynomial and provide it as such. But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the constant term is 20, as I calculated earlier, and the coefficient from the first part is 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, perhaps the answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, and I want the term where \\(c\\) is also at a specific power, say \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 120. But the problem doesn't specify the power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider only the constant term in the second expansion, leading to 120.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), meaning that it's 6, but that seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve multiplying by the entire second expansion, but that results in a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient is a polynomial and provide it as such, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the second part is just there to confuse me. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, let me try to look at it differently. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, perhaps the answer is 6. But I'm not sure because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's only considering the constant term, which would make it 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just expecting 6, but I'm not certain.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look up similar problems or think about how coefficients work when multiplying polynomials. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by the second polynomial, it becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems odd because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term, which would be 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, but that's a polynomial, not a number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just there to test if I can separate variables. So, perhaps the answer is 6. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, let me try to think differently. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that's under the condition that \\(c = 1\\), which isn't specified in the problem. So, perhaps that's not the right approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve multiplying the two expansions. So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in that case, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\), as the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 120. But the problem doesn't specify the exponent of \\(c\\), so maybe that's not what it's asking.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that and provide the polynomial as the coefficient. But the problem says \"the coefficient\", implying a single number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as \\(6a^2b^2\\), and it's multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient is 6, and the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it because they are separate variables. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are part of the other variables. So, maybe the answer is 6. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, I'm going to try to check my reasoning. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\\), which is a polynomial. So, the coefficient is not a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient is this polynomial, but the problem says \"the coefficient\", implying a single number, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion. So, the constant term is 20, and the coefficient from the first part is 6, so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term is 120. But the problem doesn't specify the power of \\(c\\), so perhaps that's not what it's asking.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and since the \\(c\\) terms are separate, the coefficient is just 6. So, the answer is 6. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look up an example. If I have \\((a + b)^n \\times (c + d)^m\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^kb^{n - k}\\), it would be \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\((c + d)^m\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} \\times (c + d)^m\\). Therefore, in this problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. So, the answer is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion, which would be 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is also 120. But the problem doesn't specify, so I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. So, the answer is 6. But I'm not certain.\n\nWait, I think I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with a coefficient of 6, and when multiplied by the entire second expansion, the coefficient becomes \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, which suggests that perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient is 6, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. But the problem doesn't specify the exponent of \\(c\\), so I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, perhaps the answer is 6. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient is a polynomial and provide it as such, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, I think I've spent enough time on this. I'll go with the answer being 6, as that's the coefficient from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the constant term in the second expansion is 20, so multiplying by 6 gives 120. So, perhaps the answer is 120. I'm confused.\n\nWait, let me try to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part as \\(6a^2b^2\\), and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient is a polynomial and provide it as such. But the problem says \"the coefficient\", implying a single number, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion, which would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Therefore, perhaps the answer is 120.\n\nWait, I think I've convinced myself that the answer is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, considering the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, that part is straightforward. Now, the expression also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to consider this part as well. But wait, the term we're looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, maybe I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term in the second part would just contribute a scalar multiple, and the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part would remain as is. So, let me check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because \\(c^0\\) is 1, so that term is just a number. So, let me compute that. First, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient should be 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can treat the \\(c\\) terms separately. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term in the second part. Therefore, the total coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that makes sense. I don't think I missed any cross terms or anything because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the only contribution comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term in the second expression. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\n\\]\nSimplifying each term, we get:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6, and the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts. But hold on, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, right? Because the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply them together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would just be multiplied by whatever term comes from expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean the coefficient is just 6, regardless of the other part? Or do I need to consider the entire expression? \n\nWait, no, because the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean we're looking for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by something, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, right? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times some coefficient, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion? Wait, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't present unless the second expansion contributes a term with \\(1\\), which it doesn't. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6, because all the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) are multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is 0. Wait, but that seems conflicting. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, when you multiply these two expressions together, you get a product where each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part, which is 6\\(a^2b^2\\), and multiply it by every term from the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each of those terms will have some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term from the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by 6\\(a^2b^2\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient is just 6, and the rest are higher terms with \\(c\\) involved.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those terms will have different powers of \\(c\\), but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself is multiplied by each of those coefficients. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's actually 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only present in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), as 6\\(a^2b^2\\). When you multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself is not a single term; instead, it becomes part of multiple terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion is actually 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems incorrect because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be 6 if we're considering the term without any \\(c\\) terms. But since the entire expression includes \\(c\\) terms, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, perhaps I need to find the term in the second expansion where \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term, and then multiply that by 6.\n\nYes, that makes more sense. Because in the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only be present if it's multiplied by a term from the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. All other terms will have some power of \\(c\\), so they won't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone.

    "text": " So, that part is clear. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I think I can also expand this using the binomial theorem. Let me write that down. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the entire original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the product of two polynomials. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I need to look at the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and then multiply it by the entire second expansion. But wait, actually, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first expansion, and the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, when we multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think we don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, actually, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be present in each of these products, but each time multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think we just need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire second expansion. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's actually asking for the sum of all coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, each product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me clarify. Let me denote the first part as \\(P = (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\), and the second part as \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when we multiply \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\), we get \\(P \\times Q = \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\right)\\). So, each term in \\(P \\times Q\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\). That happens when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), which gives us \\(k = 2\\). So, for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, the term \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\) will be present. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because each term contributes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) to the coefficient. Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for all \\(m\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m=0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check this again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in the second expansion. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would just be the product of the two coefficients, which is 6 times 64, but that might not be what the problem is asking for. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, in the entire product, every term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by 6 (the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part). So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6, and when multiplied by the second expansion, each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the corresponding power of \\(c\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all \\(k\\) of 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But that's equivalent to 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would be different. Let me check that interpretation. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent is 0. From earlier, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify the exponent of \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. However, in the problem statement, it just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which typically would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the other variables. But in this case, since the expression is a product of two variables, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first expansion, then when we multiply by the second expansion, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the power of \\(c\\), so 384. But to be thorough, let me check both interpretations.\n\nFirst interpretation: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). Then, it's 6 * sum of coefficients in the second expansion = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSecond interpretation: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Then, it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would include all powers of \\(c\\), so the first interpretation. Therefore, the answer would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When we have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is the same as the coefficient of that term multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, for example, if we have \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\), because each term in \\(Q\\) gets multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, in this case, since \\(Q\\) is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of its coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\), as I calculated earlier.\n\nSince the problem didn't specify the exponent of \\(c\\), I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so the answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me check this again. Let me think about how the product works. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^0\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. Therefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. However, if we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then we would need to sum all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is \\(2^6 = 64\\), the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression includes both \\(a, b, c\\). So, the problem is probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges over the exponents in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(k = 2\\), and \\(m\\) can be any value. Therefore, the coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSince the problem didn't specify the exponent of \\(c\\), I think the answer is 384.\n\nBut let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so 2. But if I expand it, it's \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which matches 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first expansion times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. Therefore, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 384.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me calculate it step by step.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nThe sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nSo, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by expanding each part separately and then combining the results. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. The sum of the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n3. Multiply these results: \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I don't need to consider the second part when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part.

So, if I think about it, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). \n\nWait, but let me check that again. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct because I think I might be overcomplicating it. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by the entire second part's expansion.

Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times (1/c)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m - (6 - m)} = a^kb^{4 - k}c^{2m - 6}\\).

Because if we're considering the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that includes all the contributions from the second part, but only the constant term in the second part would contribute to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, the problem is a bit ambiguous. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but in the entire expression, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make much sense because each term would have some power of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is actually an expression in terms of \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem is just asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because then the coefficient would be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, meaning the term \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\). That makes sense. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part, which is 20. So, the combined coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) correctly using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, I correctly identified that to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, I needed the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Solving \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) gives \\(k = 3\\), and the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is indeed 20. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. I think that's correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, if I'm considering the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer. So, I think my initial approach is correct: the coefficient is 120.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that the two parts of the expression are independent. The first part contributes the \\(a^2b^2\\) term with coefficient 6, and the second part contributes the constant term with coefficient 20. Since these are multiplied together, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) (times \\(c^0\\)) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, I'm confident that 120 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, that part is straightforward. Now, the expression also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if I need to expand this part as well, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, that might not be right. Because the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term in the product will be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that the coefficient will be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion will just add to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by 6. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right either. Let me think again. When you have two separate expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(1\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) because we're only interested in the term that doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but actually, the entire expression is a product, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6 \\times \\text{something}\\), where \\(\\text{something}\\) is the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), maybe we don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that's not correct. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will actually be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will contribute to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because \\(c\\) and \\(a\\), \\(b\\) are separate variables. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in that expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing to the overall coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) and the constant term from the second expression, which is 1. Wait, but let me think: when you expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) balance out. So, the general term in that expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). To find the constant term, we set the exponent of \\(c\\) to zero: \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, which suggests that maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^5(1/c) + 15c^4(1/c)^2 + 20c^3(1/c)^3 + 15c^2(1/c)^4 + 6c(1/c)^5 + (1/c)^6\\). Simplifying the second expression, it becomes \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient becomes \\(6 \\times\\) that coefficient. So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but earlier I thought that maybe only the constant term contributes, but that would be 20, giving 120. Which is correct? Let me think about it differently. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then every term in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), will result in a term like \\(6 \\times \\text{coefficient} \\times a^2b^2 \\times c^{\\text{some power}}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) is indeed \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems to be the case if we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then the coefficient would be different. But since the problem doesn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be the sum of all contributions from each term in the second expansion. So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, let me double-check. Let me think about how the product works. The product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be thought of as the sum over all terms \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m / c^n\\), but actually, it's better to think of it as each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for each term \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) in the first expansion, it is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has coefficients and powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6\\) (from the first expansion) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) is indeed \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, let me confirm this by another method. Alternatively, if I consider that the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's equivalent to taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But this is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's actually 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all variables, then it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again: when you have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the overall coefficient. So, yes, it should be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me think about a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product would be \\(1 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be the same. But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's not a single number; it's a polynomial. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is not a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which suggests it's a single number, implying that maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, but that still wouldn't make sense because it's a polynomial in multiple variables. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. In that case, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Let me check that. So, in the second expansion, the constant term is 20, as I found earlier. So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by 20, I get \\(120a^2b^2\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 120. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\), it's 384. But given the way the problem is phrased, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me see if I can find another approach. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire product as a product of two independent expansions and find the coefficient accordingly. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" The problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the constant term in the second expansion, giving 120. I'm a bit confused. Let me try to think of it as a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting a single number, which suggests that maybe I'm supposed to consider only the constant term in the second expansion. So, perhaps the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That seems more plausible because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a single number. So, maybe the answer is 120. Let me confirm that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we consider the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this affects the coefficient. Wait, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so maybe the coefficient in the entire expression is just 6 times the coefficient from the second part when considering \\(c\\). But actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, that doesn't make sense because each term in the expansion would have a power of \\(c\\) and a power of \\(1/c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would be \\(6 \\times\\) something involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). So, I need to find when the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a constant term, i.e., when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because only then, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will give a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant, so the coefficient would be 6 times that constant. So, let me think: in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me check that again. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term \\(20\\). So when you multiply them together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the entire expression as a product of two expansions and find the coefficient where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out. So, another way to approach it is to consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the coefficient will be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, as I found earlier, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems consistent. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, I think I need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as well. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part \\((a + b)^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think the coefficient from the second part will just be a constant multiplier. \n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part, when expanded, has terms that don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so each term from the first part is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a sum of terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when multiplied, each term in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the \\(c\\) part is just a constant multiplier. Wait, but no, because when you expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't sound right because the problem is likely asking for the coefficient when considering all terms, including those with \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so perhaps the entire product is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Therefore, when you multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all the terms. But since the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient is \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so it's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 64, so 6*64=384. But maybe that's not the case because the problem might just be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6\\) multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable. But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm supposed to consider only the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. That would make more sense. So, let's try that approach.\n\nFirst, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) is the middle term when expanded. Let me find that. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the coefficient is 120. Let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\), coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, correct. The second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), correct. So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, which should be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Hmm, maybe I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear with a coefficient that is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will have a coefficient equal to 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so when you multiply, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term in the second expansion would be 6 times each term, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's 6 times 64, which is 384. So, the coefficient is 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. Let me consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6a^2b^2. Then, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be 6a^2b^2 times each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but is that correct? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the first polynomial is multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible coefficients from the second polynomial. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible terms, which would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials, say P(a,b) and Q(c), then the product P(a,b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term of P is multiplied by each term of Q. So, the coefficient of a specific term in P, say a^2b^2, would be multiplied by each term in Q, so in the product, the term a^2b^2 would have coefficients multiplied by each term in Q. Therefore, if I'm just looking for the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the entire product, regardless of the c terms, it's the coefficient from P times the sum of all coefficients in Q. Because each term in Q contributes to a different power of c, but the a^2b^2 term's coefficient is the same across all those contributions. \n\nSo, to confirm, the sum of all coefficients in Q(c) is Q(1). So, substituting c = 1 into Q(c) gives the sum of all coefficients. Therefore, Q(1) = (1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64. Therefore, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me think about the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients is when we set c = 1, which gives us \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the entire product is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. \n\nWait, but let me just check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe by considering the entire product and looking for the term a^2b^2. But since the second part doesn't involve a or b, it's just a product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 times the sum of coefficients from the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of a^2b^2c^k for some specific k, then I would have to compute 6 times the coefficient of c^k in the second expansion. But since it's just a^2b^2, regardless of c, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6*64=384. \n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{384}"

I wonder if I need to consider this part when finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so actually, when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\).

But wait, that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion would include all the terms with \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct either. Let me think again. When you have two separate polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, but only when the variables match. Since in this case, the variables \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\) are all different, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me clarify: The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by 6, it would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Alternatively, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Let me verify this. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since the variables are separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect it because they're separate variables. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, you're combining all terms. Wait, perhaps the confusion is that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and when multiplied by the entire second polynomial, it becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire second polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, as each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me check this with another approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term would be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for some integer \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But let me double-check this. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the product of the two polynomials. The first polynomial is \\(6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\), and the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me consider a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, which is \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\), multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so 1 * 2 = 2. Alternatively, expanding \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c) = c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't appear here because there's no \\(b\\) in the second polynomial. Wait, so in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be zero because \\(b\\) is not present in the second polynomial. Hmm, that contradicts my earlier reasoning. So, in this simpler case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, not 2. So, that means my earlier approach was wrong. Therefore, I need to rethink this.\n\nWait, so in the original problem, we have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The variables \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\) are separate, so when you multiply the two polynomials, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, but since the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the product terms will be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and that coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, in my earlier simple example, that approach gave me the wrong answer. So, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try again with the simple example: \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(b\\) in the second polynomial, so the product can't have \\(a^2b^2\\). But according to the approach, the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 2, so 1 * 2 = 2, which is incorrect. Therefore, my approach must be wrong. So, perhaps the correct way is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first polynomial, because the second polynomial doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but that can't be right either because the second polynomial is being multiplied, so each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But in the simple example, this approach gives the wrong answer because the second polynomial doesn't have \\(b\\), so the product can't have \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, perhaps the correct way is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present if the second polynomial has a term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, but in the original problem, the second polynomial is only in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from \\(c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which are all constants relative to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, in the simple example, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(b\\) terms, so when you multiply, you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the simple example, the second polynomial is \\((c + 1/c)\\), which doesn't have \\(b\\), so when you multiply by \\((a + b)^2\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2/c\\), \\(2ab c\\), \\(2ab/c\\), \\(b^2c\\), \\(b^2/c\\). So, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the second polynomial doesn't have a constant term (i.e., a term with \\(c^0\\)). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. So, in the original problem, the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Does this expansion have a constant term? Let's check. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be written as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the second polynomial has a constant term of 20. Therefore, when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that makes more sense. So, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, in my earlier reasoning, I thought the coefficient was 6 times the sum of all coefficients, which is 64, giving 384. But now, with the simple example, I see that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually 6 times the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 20, giving 120. So, perhaps I was wrong earlier, and the correct approach is to find the constant term in the second polynomial and multiply it by the coefficient from the first polynomial. Let me verify this with the simple example. In the simple example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first polynomial (which is 1) multiplied by the constant term in the second polynomial. The second polynomial is \\(c + 1/c\\), which doesn't have a constant term, so the constant term is zero. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 1 * 0 = 0, which matches the earlier observation. So, in the original problem, the second polynomial \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term of 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the correct answer should be 120. Let me recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The second polynomial \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) of 20. When you multiply the two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by the constant term from the second polynomial, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms in the second polynomial involve \\(c\\) raised to some power, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) (which is 6) by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) (which is 20). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all? Or is there a possibility that the \\(c\\) terms might affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. Actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part of the expression is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second part. Wait, no, that can't be right because the second part is being multiplied, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all terms in the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate expression, so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by other terms. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, the second part, which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the answer is simply the coefficient from the first part, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by other terms that don't involve \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right either because the entire expression is a product, so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that would be the case if we were considering the product of the two expressions, and we were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the second part is a separate expression, so perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, and the second part is just a scalar multiple, so the coefficient would be the product of the two coefficients. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is an expression, not a scalar. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we also need to consider the \\(c\\) terms such that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expression and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression. So, perhaps that's the case. Let me check.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". Hmm, but in the entire product, each term would be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6, in steps of 2. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^m\\) for any \\(m\\). But that would mean the coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would give an expression in terms of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient, implying that it's a constant, not an expression in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a constant. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product.\n\nSo, let's proceed under that assumption. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we can consider the product of the coefficients from each part. So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), as I calculated earlier.\n\nNext, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), because we want the total exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0. So, let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part gives me 6, and the second part gives me 20, so 6 times 20 is indeed 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is indeed just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then the coefficient would just be 6, but that seems unlikely because the expression also involves \\(c\\). So, I think the correct interpretation is that we need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nLet me double-check my steps. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when the exponents from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel each other out. So, the exponent from \\(c\\) is \\(6 - m\\) and from \\(1/c\\) is \\(-m\\), so total exponent is \\(6 - 2m\\). Setting that equal to 0 gives \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial is 20, so their product is 120, which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression. So, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that the problem is indeed asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). The problem says: \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". Hmm, that wording is a bit ambiguous. It could be interpreted in two ways: either the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6, or the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Since the problem includes the \\(c\\) terms, it's more likely that they want the coefficient where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it would be 6, but that seems too simple, especially given the presence of the \\(c\\) terms. So, I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me also check my binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) is correct. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct. So, 6 times 20 is 120. That seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Therefore, the final answer is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about the entire expression. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20c^0\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then the answer would be 6, but I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient where the \\(c\\) terms are also considered, so 120 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression has a coefficient of 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) in the second expression has a coefficient of 20, so their product is 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, that seems correct.\n\nI think I've considered this from multiple angles, and each time I arrive at the same conclusion: the coefficient is 120. So, I feel confident that this is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts: expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, i.e., \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

So, when you have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). For example, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when you multiply this by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4\\), and so on. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the other expansion, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the other expansion has negative exponents as well. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, that approach might not be correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term.

But is that the case?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part of the expression only involves \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in that expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would give a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) times something with \\(c\\). So, if I collect all such terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64 \\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Suppose I don't substitute \\(c = 1\\). Instead, I consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is indeed 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in the \\(c\\) part. In that case, we would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term, and then multiply it by 6. So, let me check that approach.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), meaning that all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), would contribute to the coefficient. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm confused now because the problem could be interpreted in two ways: either it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384, or it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. But the problem statement is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's the first interpretation, that the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficients of the product are not just the products of the sums of coefficients. That approach might be incorrect because each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but the variables are separate. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on \\(c\\), which isn't possible for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\). Therefore, the answer would be 120.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure. Let me try to approach it differently. Let's consider the entire expansion. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, and coefficients are numerical, perhaps we're supposed to consider only the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean the coefficient is a sum over all powers of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem didn't specify any constraint on \\(c\\). So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But if we consider the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), that would be \\(1 \\times 1 = 1\\). So, in that case, the coefficient is 1. Similarly, in our problem, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But in that case, the coefficient would be 384, but that seems too large, and also, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't mention \\(c\\) at all. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\). Therefore, the answer would be 120.\n\nBut I'm still a bit confused because the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\). Maybe I should look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then considering that the second part is a constant multiplier, which is the sum of its coefficients, which is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems inconsistent with the idea that variables are separate.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a numerical value.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 1 (from the term 1/c * c = 1). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\) would be 1 * 1 = 1. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 1 * (c + 1/c), which is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's written as \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nBut to make sure, let me think about the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6a^2b^2. Then, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will be multiplied by 6a^2b^2, resulting in terms like 6a^2b^2c^6, 6a^2b^2c^4, etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nBut wait, the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm still not sure because the problem statement is ambiguous regarding \\(c\\). However, given that the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), and that the coefficient is a numerical value, I think the intended answer is 120, considering the constant term in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of a specific term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) would be the coefficient in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire polynomial \\(Q(c)\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(Q(c)\\), which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nYes, I think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0). This occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (considering the constant term in \\(c\\)) is 120.\n\n$\\boxed{120}$"

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I can ignore the second part because it's multiplied by other terms that don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so it doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but no, because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, the rest of the terms from the second part don't affect it. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, the second part can contribute any coefficient, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient from the second part would just be 1, right? Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the second part is a separate expansion, so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, that might not be right either. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first expression, and the second expression has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be present if the second expression contributes a term with \\(c^0\\), i.e., a constant term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second expression, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{constant}\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Let me just double-check my reasoning. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6. Now, that's just the first part of the expression. The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that as well. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I need to consider how the \\(c\\) terms interact with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms? Hmm, let me think. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part of the expression, which is only in terms of \\(c\\), I think the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which includes multiple terms. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), we need to consider how the multiplication affects the coefficient. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Wait, but that's not quite right. Let me clarify. Suppose I have \\( (a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms} \\) and \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\text{some terms} \\). When I multiply them, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the coefficient when the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 1 (i.e., when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). So, actually, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because only that term will, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's do that. Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). We need to find the term where the exponent is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the coefficient from the second part for the \\(c^0\\) term is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from the other part. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiplying it by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part. Therefore, yes, it's 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6, and the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) shouldn't be affected by the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). That is, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat the two parts separately. \n\nIn other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply for the terms with the same variables. But in this case, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are entirely separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire sum from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the entire sum would include a lot of terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not any specific term involving \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a number, and the expansion of the second part is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. But that's not correct because the second part isn't just a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\)? Or is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\)? Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). That means, in the entire product, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) (positive or negative) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean the coefficient is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right either.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. When you have two separate polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Then, when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\). That is, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all possible terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that also doesn't make sense because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be 6 * 64 = 384? That seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm confusing the concepts here. Let me try another approach. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, when you multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) isn't a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all those terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate term from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible terms, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient is a scalar, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the product is a sum of terms each involving powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that might make sense. Because if you think of the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But how do we find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me verify. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's simply 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think my initial approach is correct: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\), but it doesn't specify. The problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so it's likely that it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but considering only the constant term in \\(c\\). That is, the term where the power of \\(c\\) cancels out, so \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by 6. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, perhaps it's considering only the term where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, leaving a constant term. So, let me try that approach. \n\nFirst, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Once we have that, multiply the two coefficients together to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\). \n\nSo, how do we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but earlier I thought the coefficient was 384, but now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct? Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). If it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 * 64 = 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a number. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating again. Let me think differently. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let me consider the entire product. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) = 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the entire expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I think that's not the case because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 120. \n\nWait, let me confirm. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms with \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Each of these terms is then multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each of these terms, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2/c^2\\), \\(36a^2b^2/c^4\\), and \\(6a^2b^2/c^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that's not a single number; it's a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384, but that's a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't mention \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, so maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient to be a polynomial, but that doesn't make sense because coefficients are numbers. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but as it stands, it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the answer is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, let me think again. If I have two polynomials, say P(a,b) and Q(c), then the product P(a,b) * Q(c) will have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. Therefore, the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), would be that coefficient multiplied by the entire Q(c). So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * Q(c), which is 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is in the way I'm interpreting it. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numbers. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut I'm confused because the problem statement isn't clear. Let me try to see what the standard interpretation would be. Typically, when asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, if the term involves variables from both polynomials, you have to consider the product. But in this case, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting me to realize that the coefficient is a polynomial and to express it as such, but that's not likely because the problem says \"the coefficient\", implying a single number. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me think about it differently. If I have two polynomials, say \\(P(a,b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then their product is \\(P(a,b) \\times Q(c)\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a,b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is not a single number but a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it doesn't specify. Therefore, perhaps the problem is incorrectly stated, or I'm misinterpreting it. \n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number, so that can't be right. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a number. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me compute the entire product and see what the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, multiplying these together, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6)\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is this entire polynomial. However, coefficients are typically numerical values, not polynomials. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's the entire polynomial, but that's not a number. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't mention \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, I think the problem must be expecting me to consider that the coefficient is a polynomial, but that seems unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. \n\nWait, to make sure, let me consider another approach. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, I must have made a mistake. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the product is a single polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, which isn't possible unless it's considering a specific term. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, so I must have misunderstood. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a number. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 120, considering the constant term in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but let me check the problem again. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering that the entire expression is a product, and the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting me to realize that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, but that's not a number. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think differently. If I have two polynomials, say \\(P(a,b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then their product is \\(P(a,b) \\times Q(c)\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a,b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times Q(c)\\). Therefore, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is \\(6(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6)\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps the problem is miswritten or I'm misinterpreting it. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that \\(c\\) is a variable, but the problem is to find the coefficient in terms of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6)\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that's a polynomial. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 120, considering the constant term in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, to confirm, let me calculate the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). As I did earlier, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384, but that's a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 120. \n\nWait, but I'm still confused because the problem statement is ambiguous. However, given the options, I think the most reasonable interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, I'll go with 120 as the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of both parts. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these coefficients together to get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I also have to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, regardless of the second part? Because when you multiply two expressions, the terms combine by adding exponents, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their coefficients shouldn't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. Let me think about this. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I expand it, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're only concerned with the part that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\), right? Wait, no. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) will not affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient isn't just 6, but 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right either. Let me clarify. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have some power of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that makes more sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these two terms multiply together to give the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the expansion is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, the coefficient is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that makes sense. Let me recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. We have two separate parts: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we just need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiply them together. That gives us 6 times 20, which is 120. I don't see any mistakes in that logic. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from each part:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, that part gives me 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to consider that as well. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part of the product. So, perhaps the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). Let me think: when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the other variables. So, does that mean that regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6? Wait, that seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) as separate terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, their coefficients don't depend on the second part. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too high. Wait, no, because each term in the product is multiplied together, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but when considering the entire product, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that might not be correct because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) for each term in the second expansion. So, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 384. But wait, that seems like a lot. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6, and the rest are separate terms with \\(c\\) involved. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so each of those would have different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second expansion's coefficients. So, perhaps the correct answer is 384. Wait, but let me check the problem again. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term would be of the form \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, I think. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by other variables. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Let me see: the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.

    "text": " So, that part is straightforward; the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6, because when you multiply by the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), any term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) would just be multiplied by 1? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you expand the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean that in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which we don't want. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I find the constant term in a binomial expansion? I remember that in the expansion of \\((x + y)^n\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}x^{n - k}y^k\\). So, in this case, \\(x = c\\) and \\(y = 1/c\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) \u2192 \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only take the product of these two coefficients. So, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as the product of two polynomials, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's only affected by the constant term in the second polynomial. So, yes, 120 should be the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.
