    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6. Now, wait, but the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the expansion of both parts and then multiply them together. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and since it's multiplied by \\((a + b)^4\\), maybe the coefficients from the second part will affect the overall coefficient. Wait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the terms multiply. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, I need to consider how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears when multiplied by any term from the second part. But wait, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second part. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will only come from the first part, and the terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will come from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of the second part. But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe all those terms will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because each term in the second expansion has some power of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient for each of these will be the product of the coefficients from each part. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, that's not possible because when you multiply by the second part, you'll have \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Hmm, that might make more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you expand the entire expression, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we can sum all those contributions. Wait, but that might not be correct because the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Hmm, but the problem didn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, because each term in the second part has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, the coefficient for each resulting term \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all these coefficients. So, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But wait, \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\) is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\), because the sum of binomial coefficients for a given \\(n\\) is \\(2^n\\). So, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second part, each contributing their own coefficient. So, yes, that would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, another way to think about it: if we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the entire second part is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, the answer would be 384. But let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would require finding the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, let's see. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Hmm, so which interpretation is correct? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Hmm, the problem statement is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that for each term in the expansion of the second part, we're contributing a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and the coefficient of each of those terms would be 6 times the coefficient from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the sum of all those contributions, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you expand, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by every term in the second part, each contributing their own coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, another way to look at it: the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would be a specific term, not the sum of all coefficients. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, so which is it? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But maybe I should double-check the problem statement. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that each term in the product would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and the coefficient of each of those terms would be 6 times the coefficient from the second part. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes in such problems, they might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Let me think about how the problem is structured. The expression is a product of two independent binomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms are combinations of the terms from each expansion. So, if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's indeed the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by every term in the second part, each contributing their own coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 120. Since the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), I think it's 384. But let me confirm by considering a simpler case. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this expression is the sum of the coefficients from the second part, which is 1 (from \\(c\\)) + 1 (from \\(1/c\\)), so 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part (which is 1) times the sum of coefficients in the second part (which is 2). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 2. So, applying the same logic, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the expansion of each part separately. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion.\n   - The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results**:\n   - The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer**: The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Hmm, I think so because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because they are separate variables. Let me think: if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), any term in the second part involving \\(c\\) won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for the constant term, I guess. Wait, no, actually, that might not be correct. Because when you multiply, the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) could contribute to the overall coefficient. Wait, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps I should treat them separately. Let me clarify: The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I expand both parts, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps I can consider that the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that don't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), but that seems a bit confusing. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate term, and when you multiply by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion. But since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right either because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 * 64 = 384? Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), it would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so it's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems plausible, but I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that each term in the product is a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term from the first expansion, its coefficient would be multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. In that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, let's do that. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find that, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\) \u21d2 \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that makes more sense. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients, but actually, I should only consider the coefficient where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 because we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by 1, not by any \\(c\\) terms. So, the correct approach is to multiply the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which gives 6 * 20 = 120. Let me double-check that. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. The term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6 * 20 * a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Final Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Wait, so the coefficient is 6. But the original expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part, which is a separate variable. So, when we multiply the two expressions, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because when you multiply by the second expression, each term in the first part gets multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the multiplication by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the coefficient is just 6. But wait, let me think again. When we expand the entire expression, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), does that mean we have to consider all the possible ways \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\)? Hmm, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, and when multiplied by any term from the second expression, it would become \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\) for some \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is only possible when the second factor contributes a term with \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient from the first part. That makes sense because when you multiply the two expressions, the terms that result in \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when you take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. So, let me calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both parts, which is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. So, yes, that should be the correct coefficient. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), we're effectively looking for the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. So, that should be 6 times 20, which is 120. I think that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   Setting the exponent of \\(c\\) to 0 gives \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever coefficient it gets from the other part. But wait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the other part doesn't affect it. Wait, no, that can't be right because the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think we can consider the entire expression as a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not quite right because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and we're summing all those contributions. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and since the second part is multiplied by each term, but we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then perhaps the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that would mean 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, the specific term is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), any term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) must come from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and any term from the second part, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me check with a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). Then, expanding, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the product would be \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2, because from \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2*(1/c)\\). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2*(1 + 1) = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1*(1 + 1) = 2. So, in this case, the coefficients in the product are indeed the original coefficients multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. So, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the total coefficient is 6*64 = 384. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each part. But no, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so maybe it's correct that the coefficient is 6*64 = 384. Wait, but let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when you multiply it by each term in the second part, each of those terms will have different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we have to sum all the coefficients from the second part because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it and the answer is just 6, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is multiplied in, so the coefficient should be scaled by the number of terms in the second part. Wait, but when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of a specific term in the first polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. Let me check with another example to confirm. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^1 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1*(1 + 1) = 2, because \\(a*c\\) and \\(a*(1/c)\\). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is 1*(1 + 1) = 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is 1 (from the first part) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second part). So, that seems to confirm that the coefficient is indeed the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of coefficients from the second part. So, applying that to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. Let me check one more time. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a coefficient of 6. Then, this term is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms like \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). Each of these has a coefficient, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all these coefficients, which is 64. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Yes, that makes sense. So, the final answer is 384. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of coefficients in the second part. The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, that part is correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is it possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively? Because in the product, each term would have exponents from both parts. So, if that's the case, then the coefficient would be different. Let me check the problem statement again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient is 384. But if it were asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we would have to find the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, which would be the constant term in the second expansion. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem doesn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. When you have the product of two expressions, the terms are multiplied together. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would have a coefficient of 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second part. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, all terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\)), which is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as in the first part, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) term. So, that would again give 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a concrete example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). As I did earlier, expanding, the product is \\(a^2c + a^2*(1/c) + 2ab*c + 2ab*(1/c) + b^2c + b^2*(1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1*(1 + 1) = 2, which is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2*(1 + 1) = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) is 1*(1 + 1) = 2. So, that seems to confirm the approach. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing the concept. The coefficient of a term in a product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by any term from the second part, regardless of the \\(c\\) term. So, each such multiplication contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part (which is 64). So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the entire expression being \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which has coefficients summing up to 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any specific \\(k\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all possible powers of \\(c\\), but since the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), we have to consider all terms where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents are 2, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. Therefore, the coefficient is the sum of all such terms, which is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another way. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. If that's the case, then the coefficient would be different. Let me check the problem statement again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as in the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that can't be right because the second part is being multiplied in, so it does affect the overall coefficients by scaling them.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, but when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think of it in another way. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this would be 6 * 64 = 384. That seems to confirm it.\n\nAlternatively, if I set \\(c = 1\\), the expression simplifies, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems to back up the earlier conclusion.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing any negative signs or anything. The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has positive coefficients only because both terms are positive. So, the sum of coefficients is indeed 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me try to compute the sum of coefficients in the second part again. The sum of coefficients is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and confirm that the sum of the coefficients is indeed 64. The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), and then it starts decreasing: 15, 6, 1. So, the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. Adding them up: 1 + 6 = 7, +15 = 22, +20 = 42, +15 = 57, +6 = 63, +1 = 64. So, yes, the sum of coefficients is indeed 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial step. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which as we saw, has a sum of coefficients equal to 64. So, when you multiply the two, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by any term from the second polynomial, regardless of the \\(c\\) term. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me think about it differently. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), would be multiplied by each term in Q, but since Q is in terms of c, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as in P multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in this case, Q(c) is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a Laurent polynomial, meaning it can have negative exponents. But when we talk about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c, it's just the sum over all coefficients in Q(c), because each term in Q(c) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nSo, yes, I think that's correct. The coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)? If so, then the coefficient would be different. Let me check the problem statement again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about c, so I think it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c. So, in that case, the coefficient is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)\", then we would need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would involve finding the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's consider the product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4) \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\n\\]\n\nWhen you multiply these, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should consider that each term in the product is \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^m\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, so 6*20=120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check once more. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes all powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6*64=384.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6, and the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nNow, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I'm multiplying \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term in the first part is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when I multiply it by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to consider how this affects the term \\(a^2b^2\\). But actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are being multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of two polynomials: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply them together, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But the problem is asking only for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and then that coefficient will carry over to the entire product, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\)?\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the second part is being multiplied by the first part. So, actually, every term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that means we're looking for all terms where the product has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(some term from the second expansion)}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the same as the coefficient in the first part, multiplied by the entire second part. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to break it down.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire expression. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, \\(6\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so perhaps it's just 6 times the entire second part, but that seems too broad. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would include all possible coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that's not right because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second part, each of those products will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, no, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which suggests that it's considering the product as a polynomial in all variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's looking for the coefficient of the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the product would be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(term from the second expansion)}\\). But that seems a bit odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the part of the expression that has \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply by the second part, you're introducing factors of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just being multiplied as a whole. But that seems too simplistic. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a product of two independent expansions, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, no, the second expansion is separate, so when you multiply them together, the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that's not a single coefficient. Hmm, I'm confused.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that's a polynomial, not a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is mistyped, and it's supposed to be in a single variable, but I don't think so. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, maybe the answer is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, but that would be 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), but that's not correct because the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that the correct approach? Because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but that's not quite right. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, because the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, no, that can't be because when you multiply by the second expansion, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that's a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that seems too simplistic, and I think the problem is expecting a more detailed answer.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, and when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second polynomial. But that's not correct because the second polynomial has multiple terms. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be the same as the coefficient in the first part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient would just be 6, and that's it. But I'm not sure if that's correct because when you multiply by the second part, you're essentially scaling the entire first polynomial by the second polynomial. So, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that's a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But that would be 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it differently. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that's a polynomial, so perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, but that seems too involved. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a constant factor, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a variable expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of it as a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the resulting polynomial will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{-m}\\), depending on the terms from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a single number. So, let me assume that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the overall coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nSo, let's calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\); it just asked for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating again. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as I calculated earlier. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a constant factor, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a variable expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be the same as the coefficient in the first part because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient would just be 6. But that seems too simplistic, and I think the problem is expecting a more detailed answer, considering the entire product. So, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, perhaps it's expecting the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just 6, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me think differently. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiply it by any term from the second polynomial, because the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, perhaps it's expecting the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely confident about this approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the answer is 6. But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me try to see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nWait, another approach: The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can treat the second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and when you multiply by the second part, it's just scaling that coefficient by the entire second expansion. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe it's expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me think about how polynomial multiplication works. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, and the coefficients are multiplied. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial has a coefficient of 6, and it is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each coefficient from the second polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's actually the sum of all these products. Wait, no, that's not correct. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second polynomial. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), perhaps it's the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, that makes sense because when you set \\(c = 1\\), you're effectively summing all the coefficients in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the correct approach.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of all its coefficients, set \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients: 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   To find the sum of all coefficients in this expansion, we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if I need to consider that part when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part, maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest of the expression doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by other terms. But wait, let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) is 1, and multiplying by that won't change the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, so maybe I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because when I multiply by that term, it won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, let me check that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the term with \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by 20, and the other terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term because they're multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the product is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear is when you take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct. Let me just check my steps again. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\), find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.

    "text": " Hmm, so the coefficient is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think so because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the first expression is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), maybe the terms don't interfere with each other? So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are independent of the \\(c\\) terms.

So, actually, the \\(c\\) terms would be multiplied by the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, but since we're only looking for the term with \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\), but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a scalar multiple of 1, not involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that seems too broad. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That might make sense. So, first, I find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and multiply it by 6 to get the final coefficient. Let me check that logic. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Then, when I multiply each of these terms by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), we need to find the part of the product where the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(6 = 2k\\) => \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1 = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. So, going back, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second expansion), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me double-check each step. First, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6. That seems correct because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and finding the constant term. Using the binomial theorem, the exponent is \\(6 - 2k\\), set to zero, so \\(k = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, that seems correct. Then, multiplying 6 by 20 gives 120. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I consider that the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so it would only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that seems consistent with what I did earlier. Therefore, I think the coefficient is 120. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything else. For example, is there a possibility that other terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) could contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied by other terms from \\((a + b)^4\\)? But no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a specific term, and any term involving \\(c\\) would have a different variable, so it wouldn't combine with \\(a^2b^2\\) to form another term. So, only the constant term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion. Therefore, I think my answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I also have this second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, does this part affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), right? So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply each term involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression multiplies each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think we need to find the part of the expansion where the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. Because only then, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), which is what we're interested in. So, that means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That is, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that's 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes there. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients. \n\n1.

    "text": " So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I need to multiply this \\(6a^2b^2\\) term by something from the second part? Hmm, actually, no. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the other variables, I think I can just consider the coefficient from the first part and then realize that the second part's expansion will contribute a factor that's multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the entire expression is the product of two binomial expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both, you'll have a product of sums, which means each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I'm only interested in the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part times each coefficient from the second part. But since we're summing over all possible terms from the second expansion, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but actually, no. Because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, say \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, every term in the second expansion when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) will give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that's just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but that can't be right because the second part is multiplied by the first part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a scalar, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the terms here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression because each term in the second expression contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the total coefficient would be \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? I know that the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when you expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term. The sum of these coefficients is indeed when \\(c = 1\\), so it's \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me check if that makes sense. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has its own coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all those products, which is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. So, yes, that would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and it's multiplied by every term in the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions. So, when you expand everything, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Because for each term in the second expansion, you're multiplying it by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total contribution is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have products of polynomials, the coefficients can interact in more complex ways. But in this case, since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is just a scalar that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nLet me confirm this with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{2}{0} = 1\\), and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be \\(1 \\times 2 = 2\\). Let's see: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). Multiplying them gives \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(1 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's just the sum of the coefficients in the second part times the coefficient from the first part. So, yes, that would be \\(1 \\times 2 = 2\\). So, that seems to check out. \n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of the coefficients in the second part. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, that part is correct. \n\nAlternatively, I could think about the entire expansion as a product and realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the first part, and the second part just scales it by its own sum of coefficients. So, yes, 384 seems correct. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Maybe I can use multinomial coefficients or consider the entire expansion. But I think the approach I took is correct. \n\nWait, another thought: if I were to multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the resulting expression would have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{-m}\\), etc., but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times\\) sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384. \n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), whose sum of coefficients is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), and the first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply them together, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms will only come from the first part, and the \\(c\\) terms from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it's like multiplying by a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times whatever the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. Wait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), so maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all.

The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, in the entire expansion, find the coefficient for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that might be complicated because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me try another approach. Let's expand both parts separately and then multiply them.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\nSo, as I found before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) (which has a coefficient of 6) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, that's not quite right. Because each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when we set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Is that correct?\n\nWait, let me think again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, when I multiply by the first expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. But let me verify that because I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part has a coefficient of 6. When you multiply this by the entire second polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of its coefficients is indeed 64, as I calculated before. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Suppose I don't consider the entire sum but think about the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Each term in the product is of the form \\(a^{k}b^{4 - k} \\times c^{m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is 6, and then for each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm correct, but let me see if there's another approach. Let me think of the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c, 1/c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so when I expand the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, multiplied by the sum over all possible terms from the second part, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when I multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by any term from the second polynomial, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of its coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 2^6 = 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. In that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would be different because then I have to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero in the second expansion. So, let's consider that.\n\nIn the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Hmm, I'm confused now.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem doesn't specify \\(c^0\\), so maybe it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me think again. If I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me verify with an example. Let's take a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\n\\]\n\\[\n(c + 1/c) = c + 1/c\n\\]\nMultiplying them together:\n\n\\[\n(a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c) = a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\n\\]\nNow, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in this product would be 2 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(c + 1/c\\), so the sum of coefficients is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, 2 * 2 = 4. But looking at the expansion, the term \\(2ab\\) is multiplied by \\(c + 1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 * 1 + 2 * 1 = 4, which matches. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 4, which is 2 (from the first expansion) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). So, that seems to confirm that the approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from the first expansion) times 64 (sum of coefficients in the second expansion), which is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 120, but since it's not specifying \\(c^0\\), it's 384. Let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the context of the entire expression, which includes variables \\(a, b, c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is indeed 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm wrong because in the product, each term is a product of terms from both expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion, which would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it and the answer is 6. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is part of the product, so the coefficient would be scaled by that.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate expansion, so when you multiply, the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by a polynomial, the coefficients get scaled by the sum of the other polynomial's coefficients.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Let me consider that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by any term from the second polynomial, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor, so the coefficient remains 6. But that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would be multiplied.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of it as the product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present only in the first polynomial, and when you multiply by the second polynomial, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 20, giving 120. But since it's not specifying \\(c^0\\), it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c\n\\]\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product is \\(c + 1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. But in the problem, we're looking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps in that case, the problem would specify the coefficient of \\(a c^0\\), which would be 1. But in our original problem, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem expects a numerical answer. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense because then the coefficient is a number, not a polynomial. So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me verify that.\n\nIn the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure. Let me see how the problem is phrased: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't mention \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, so it's 120. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate both and see which makes sense.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I expand the entire product, each term would be of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^{m}\\), where \\(k\\) is from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) is from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every possible \\(c^m\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. But if I'm only interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which is a bit ambiguous. In the context of the entire expression, it's possible that it's asking for the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient when \\(c\\) is at a specific power, then it's 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I can check by looking at a specific example. Let me take the first part, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), expands to terms like \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). Now, when I multiply these together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 36, and so on. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), would be the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Because otherwise, if it's asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), it would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense in this context. So, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm thinking it's 120. Let me try to clarify.\n\nThe problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nIf we interpret this as the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nBut if we interpret it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20 = 120.\n\nBut in the context of the problem, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which isn't typical. So, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem expects a numerical answer. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the other variables, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for similar problems online to see how they're phrased. But since I can't do that right now, I'll have to make an educated guess.\n\nGiven that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without specifying anything about \\(c\\), and considering that in the product, each term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.

But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product can be combined with any term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120, but that was when I was considering only the \\(c^0\\) term. So, perhaps the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, let me do a quick calculation:\n\nSum of coefficients in the second expansion: \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\).\n\nCoefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion: 6.\n\nSo, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit uncertain because sometimes problems like this ask for specific terms, but in this case, I think it's 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first expansion (6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion (64):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6. Wait, but that's just the first part. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I need to consider the entire product? But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), right? So, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Hmm, that might be the case. Let me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, does that mean the coefficient remains 6? Wait, maybe I'm oversimplifying. Let me make sure. So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), any multiplication by terms involving \\(c\\) would result in terms that have \\(c\\) in them, which aren't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product would just be the same as the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion. So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be present in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would result in a sum of terms. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term with no \\(c\\) terms, perhaps we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by, say, \\(c^k\\), that would give a term with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the idea is that when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can think of it as the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. That makes sense because any other term in the second part would have a power of \\(c\\) which would change the term we're looking for. So, yes, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which are in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that we're only considering the terms where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term from the second part will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that seems a bit off. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Hmm, that seems plausible, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me check my reasoning again. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms each of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second expansion has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c\\) of \\(6 - 2k\\). When we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, let me think again. Is that correct? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will combine with each term in the second expansion to form terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we're considering the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. So, that would indeed be 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the coefficient might refer to the coefficient when all other variables are set to 1 or something. Let me try another approach. Let's consider the entire product: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that requires \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives us \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each such term, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) values, which are from 0 to 6. So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that seems consistent with what I thought earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But wait, another way to think about it is that since the second expansion doesn't affect the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Each term in this expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first expansion (6) multiplied by the sum of coefficients from the second expansion (64):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the expression is multiplied by another part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But hold on, the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), while \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables. So, when I multiply these two expansions together, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are multiplied by the \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. However, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have multiple terms, each with different powers of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is just a term in the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, does that mean that we need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? Or is there something else I'm missing? Let me think. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, but \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) might not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because they are separate variables. So, maybe the coefficient is just 6, as calculated from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, but that can't be right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a very large number, which doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so its coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which contradicts the idea of a numerical coefficient. I'm getting confused here. Let me try another approach. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest of the expression is just multiplied by that term, so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense because then we would have to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the other expansion. Let me check that interpretation. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes terms from both expansions, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient dependent on \\(c\\), which isn't numerical. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together. Let me confirm that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Then, the term \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be the middle term, since the expansion is symmetric. Let me calculate that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be written as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the two expansions are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product would be the product of the coefficients from each expansion, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming we're looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)) is 120. Wait, but the problem didn't specify the \\(c\\) term, so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me go back to the original problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It just says \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). So, in that case, when you multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) independent of \\(c\\), meaning that we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial. So, I think that's the correct interpretation. Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the answer is 120. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. In \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Since the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), but just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think this is the intended interpretation because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on \\(c\\), which isn't a numerical value. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Hmm, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might need to consider how this term interacts with the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're essentially creating a product of two polynomials.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part gets multiplied by every term in the second part. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, and then you combine like terms. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), the terms \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part multiplied by any term from the second part will have different variables, so they won't combine.

So, maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, multiplied by some terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the question is just asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's a constant? Wait, no, because \\(c\\) is a variable, so the coefficient would depend on \\(c\\). Hmm, perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, but since \\(c\\) is involved, maybe it's a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient in the sense of the term without considering \\(c\\), but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a sum over the coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, but that might not be right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which has coefficient 6, as we found earlier, it gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient when considering the entire expression, but without any \\(c\\) terms, which doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is part of the expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified.

But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is more than just a single number. But the problem says \"the coefficient\", so maybe it's expecting a numerical value.

So, in the entire product, when you expand it, you have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, it's the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient\", which usually refers to a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so \\(c^0\\). That would make the coefficient a numerical value. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which is a bit unusual. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is mistyped and they meant to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something like that. But assuming the problem is as stated, I think the answer is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and since the product is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems like a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient is 6 times the expansion, but maybe it's just 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems plausible. Let me check that.\n\nWait, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, if I multiply that by 6, I get 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384. But wait, is that correct? Because when you set \\(c = 1\\), you're essentially summing all the coefficients, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of coefficients in the other part would give the total coefficient when \\(c = 1\\). But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem says \"the coefficient\", which usually implies a numerical value, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I would need to find the term where in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, and then multiply that by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n\nSo, let's try that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), but now I'm considering \\(c^0\\). Maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would make the answer 120. Alternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for \"the coefficient\", I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me check this again. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, meaning the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for \"the coefficient\", which is usually a number. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the intended answer is 6 * 20 = 120, assuming that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would be a polynomial, not a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it differently. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem says \"the coefficient\", so maybe it's expecting a numerical value, which would only make sense if we're considering a specific term, such as \\(c^0\\). Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely. So, I think the intended answer is 120, assuming that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Hmm, so the coefficient is 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the expansion of the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), as well. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)? Or do I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term from the second expansion?\n\nWait, no. The entire expression is the product of two expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Wait, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just part of the first expansion, and the second expansion is separate. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as in the first part because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. The entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so when you multiply them, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, because when you multiply by the second expansion, it's like multiplying by a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient remains the same. Wait, but that seems a bit confusing. Let me try to clarify.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, I need to consider all possible products where the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial is multiplied by any term from the second polynomial. But the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is a term without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when multiplied by the second polynomial, it would just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, because each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a single term, so when you multiply it by the entire second expansion, you're effectively scaling it by the entire second polynomial. But wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would include all the terms from the product. But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply it by the second polynomial, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, you get a product of two polynomials. Each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first polynomial, and when you multiply it by each term in the second polynomial, you get \\(a^2b^2c^k \\times (1/c)^{6 - k}\\), which is \\(a^2b^2c^{2k - 6}\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that the exponents of \\(c\\) must be zero, right? Because if we have \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, we need to find the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in other words, we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial.\n\nSo, let me break it down. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Once I have that, I can multiply the two coefficients together to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nOkay, so let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(k = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the same as \\(a^2b^2\\), we multiply these two coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is it correct to just multiply the coefficients from each expansion? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), we're looking for the product where the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the constant term (in terms of \\(c\\)) from the second expansion. So, yes, that should be correct.\n\nLet me verify this another way. Let's think about the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Then, when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k \\times (1/c)^{6 - k}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^2b^2c^{2k - 6}\\). The only way to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(2k - 6 = 0\\), which is when \\(k = 3\\), as I found earlier. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 6 times 20, giving 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there any other term in the expansion that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\)? I don't think so because the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so any term from the second expansion that's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) would have some power of \\(c\\), except for the term where the exponent is zero. So, yes, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these coefficients together gives:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Wait, that can't be right because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make more sense because then we're looking for a specific term in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly considering \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That seems more plausible.

Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". Wait, maybe the problem is considering all variables together, so when you expand the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the other part multiplied by the 6 from \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me approach this differently. Let me consider that the product is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't sound right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those coefficients will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But actually, no, because in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), setting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is not just a number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the coefficient as a numerical factor, treating \\(c\\) terms as separate. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, and the rest is part of the term involving \\(c\\). Wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire product, so it's possible that the coefficient includes the terms from the other expansion. I'm getting confused here. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as we found, which is 6a^2b^2. Now, when we multiply this by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will have the form 6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(term from the other expansion)}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by 6a^2b^2, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times each of those coefficients. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the product will have a coefficient, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is just one term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering all possible terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and the second part is irrelevant because \\(c\\) is a different variable. So, perhaps the answer is just 6. But that seems too simple, and the problem includes both parts, so I think it's more likely that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Let me verify this. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by each coefficient in the second expansion, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The entire expression is then multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the total coefficient, we multiply 6 by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64 when \\(c = 1\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply the two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part would be multiplied by every term from the second part, and we're only interested in the constant term (where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out) because otherwise, the term would involve \\(c\\) and we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to expand that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Is the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only affected by the \\(c^0\\) term in the second expansion? Yes, because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any other term from the second expansion, it would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would change the overall term. Since the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're assuming that the other variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are not present, so we only consider the constant term from the second expansion. So, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by expanding each part separately. Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Hmm, maybe I should think about the entire expression as a product of two expansions. So, first, let me expand both parts separately and then see how the terms combine. Let me start by expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression becomes: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find all the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, in the first part, when \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), as I found earlier. But since we're multiplying by the second expansion, which involves \\(c\\) terms, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, is that the case? Or does the problem want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\)? Hmm, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine. Wait, but in this case, the two polynomials are in different variables, so \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), because when you multiply by the other expression, which only involves \\(c\\), it doesn't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the entire second expression. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by another polynomial in \\(c\\), then when I multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) polynomial. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear in the product as \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^4 + ...\\) and so on. So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would be 6 times 15, which is 90, and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean we're considering all possible coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents? Or is the problem actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific power of \\(c\\)? Hmm, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because each term would have different powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a specific term, but since it's not specified, I think perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems too straightforward, and the presence of the \\(c\\) terms suggests that maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of the coefficients from each term in the \\(c\\) expansion multiplied by the 6 from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Each term in the \\(c\\) expansion is multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for each \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the \\(c\\) expansion. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific \\(c\\) term, then it would be 6 times the coefficient of that specific \\(c\\) term. But since the problem doesn't specify a particular \\(c\\) term, I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But let me make sure. Let me think about how the terms interact. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20c^0\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would be 6*6=36, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) would be 6*15=90, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6*20=120, and so on. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), then the total coefficient would be the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6. Let me add these up: 6 + 36 = 42, 42 + 90 = 132, 132 + 120 = 252, 252 + 90 = 342, 342 + 36 = 378, 378 + 6 = 384. So, that confirms it: the total coefficient is 384. Alternatively, since the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion is 64, as I found earlier, multiplying that by 6 gives 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, in the entire expression, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all terms where the product has \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. Therefore, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any \\(c^k\\). So, as I calculated before, that sum is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. But wait, let me think again: when you have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the coefficients are treated separately. So, in the product, each term is a product of a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and a term in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in the first part, multiplied by the entire second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6. But that seems too simple, especially since the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. When multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has a sum of coefficients equal to 64, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   When multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in this expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).

But wait, since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), does the second part affect this? Hmm, actually, no. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when we multiply the two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by all the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all the ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by terms in the second expansion without changing the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only consider the term where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2, \\(b\\) is 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because otherwise, it's a different term. So, actually, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is when the second expansion contributes a term with \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nSo, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the coefficient from the second part (which is 20). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me just verify that I didn't make a mistake in my reasoning. So, the key idea is that when you multiply two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part can only combine with the constant term (in terms of \\(c\\)) in the second part to give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms in the second part would introduce powers of \\(c\\), making the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is non-zero, which doesn't match \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, I think my reasoning is correct.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me write out the expansions more explicitly.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNext, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\):\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- \\(m = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} c^6 = 1 \\cdot c^6\\)\n- \\(m = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(m = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(m = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(m = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(m = 5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(m = 6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the constant term is indeed 20.\n\nTherefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the constant term (20) will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have additional factors of \\(c^k\\), so they won't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering the contributions from each part of the product. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):** The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):** The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:** \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"
