So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part.

So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. We have \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6.

Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120, which is the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. I don't think I missed any steps here.

So, first, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20, when we multiply these two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but is that correct? Let me think again. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by the constant term in the second part, which is 20. So, yes, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, could there be any other terms that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me check. For example, is there a term in the second polynomial that, when multiplied by some other term in the first polynomial, would result in \\(a^2b^2\\)? But the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), so unless the term in the second polynomial is a constant, any other term would have a power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the product term would have \\(c\\) as well. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve considering all possible terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) in another, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) appears is when we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple variables, you might have to consider more terms, but in this case, since \\(c\\) is separate, I think it's just 120. Wait, but let me make sure. Let me think about the expansion again. The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., each multiplied by coefficients. The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which gives terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(1\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), each with their own coefficients. When you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, for example, \\(a^4\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^4c^6\\), \\(a^4c^4\\), etc. Similarly, \\(a^3b\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, giving terms like \\(a^3bc^6\\), etc. The only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. Because any other term from the second part would introduce a power of \\(c\\), and since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't have any \\(c\\) term, that term must come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term. So, the coefficient would indeed be the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120.

Therefore, when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term (which is 6) by the constant term (which is 20) in the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only need to consider the terms where the \\(c\\) exponents cancel out, i.e., the constant term in the second polynomial. So, yes, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the entire product and see if any other terms could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second polynomial only contributes a constant term when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), any other terms in the second polynomial would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which wouldn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, I think my initial approach is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. But just to be thorough, let me write out the product and see. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), but the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is the constant term, which is 20. So, when I multiply these two polynomials, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial is 6, and it's multiplied by the constant term 20, giving 6*20=120. All other terms in the second polynomial would result in terms that have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me check once more. Maybe I'm missing something with the exponents. Let's consider that the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m=3\\), and that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}=20\\), as I found before. So, yes, that's correct. So, when I multiply the two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first is 6, and it's multiplied by 20, giving 120. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two polynomials. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but another thought: when you have two separate polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, provided that the variables don't interfere. So, in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the variables in one don't affect the other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's solid. So, I don't think I made a mistake here. So, the final answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't miscalculate the binomial coefficients. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6 because 4 choose 2 is 6. And \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20 because 6 choose 3 is 20. So, 6 * 20 is 120. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, I'm confident that the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\nThe constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

Because when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that term would only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and the constant term in the second expansion.

So, yes, I think that's correct. The coefficient is 120. But just to make sure, let me try to write it out more formally. Let me denote the two parts as \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P \\times Q\\).

Alternatively, if I consider the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), but only the constant term in \\(Q\\) would contribute to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all terms in the second part, but that's not quite right because the second part isn't a single term. Wait, no, when you multiply two polynomials, each term is a product of terms from each polynomial. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you only consider the term from the first polynomial that is \\(a^2b^2\\) and the term from the second polynomial that is \\(c^0\\), because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would change the term we're looking for.

But no, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which in the context of the product would be the sum of all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). But that seems complicated. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by every term from the second part. But since the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), each term in it is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, when I multiply 6 by each term in the second polynomial, I'll get terms like 6 * (coefficient of \\(c^k\\)) * \\(c^k\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the overall expression would have terms like \\(6 \\times \\text{(coefficient of }c^k) \\times a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Wait, that might make sense. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all the terms in the other polynomial, and the result is that the coefficient of that term in the product is the product of the coefficient and the sum of the coefficients of the other polynomial. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think more carefully. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because each term in Q(c) is a coefficient times some power of c, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in Q(c). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Because when \\(c = 1\\), each term becomes its coefficient, so the sum of coefficients is the value of the polynomial at \\(c = 1\\). So, let's compute \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check this logic again because I might be making a mistake. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) where \\(k\\) is from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) is from -6 to 6. But if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because for each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would give \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is only one term, and the product would have multiple terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all those terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), but I don't think so because the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\). So, I think the correct approach is to take the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and multiply it by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Let me check this by expanding both parts. First, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of all coefficients is when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, when we multiply the two polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Let me think about the entire product. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion, which is 6a^2b^2, and multiply it by each term in the second expansion. Each term in the second expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when we multiply 6a^2b^2 by \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\), we get \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all k of \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), because each term contributes \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{k}\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for k from 0 to 6. But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from k=0 to 6 is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that confirms my earlier conclusion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

No, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term involving \\(c\\), it won't change the \\(a^2b^2\\) part; it will just add a \\(c\\) term. So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

So, let me first find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

So, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. Because sometimes when you have multiple variables, you have to make sure that cross terms don't affect the coefficient. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their coefficients are independent. So, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but maybe I should think about it another way to confirm. Let me expand both expressions a bit more. First, \\((a + b)^4\\) has the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) as we found.

So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, if I think about the entire product, it's \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Each term in the expansion would be a term from the first expansion multiplied by a term from the second expansion. So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part. So, that's exactly what we did.

So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. When we multiply these two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, including the constant term. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), any terms in the second part that aren't constants would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which we don't care about. So, only the constant term from the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, but let me check if I'm correct in that reasoning. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). So, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20\\) would be one of the terms, giving \\(120a^2b^2\\), and the other terms would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. So, I think that's the answer. Wait, but just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way this could be approached.

I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but let me just recap to be sure. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiply these together: 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). Set this equal to 0 to find the constant term:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6, the coefficient from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, let me try that approach. First, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in the other expansion). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, and the constant term in the other expansion is 20. So, when you multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply the constant term from the second part, giving 6 * 20 = 120. Are there any other terms that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? For example, if there were terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) that somehow combined to a constant, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), any term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would not contribute to that specific term. So, I think 120 is correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the entire expansion, but I think that would complicate things. Let me think again: the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and the constant term in the other expansion. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120 is correct.
