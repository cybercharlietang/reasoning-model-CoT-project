Let me think about how to do that. Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

So, that would be 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, I found that in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.

But since we only care about the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is the \\(c^0\\) term, so 20, then the total coefficient is 6*20=120. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, so 6*20=120. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two separate polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficients of the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the coefficients in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, that's 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you expand the entire expression, each term is of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} \\times c^m / c^n\\), but since we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, that term is \\(a^2b^2\\) times some \\(c\\) terms. But we want the term where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, so the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that term is \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20, and the coefficient from the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part is 6. So, again, 6*20=120.\n\nI think that makes sense.
