    "text": " \n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that's \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how the expansion of the second part affects the coefficient. However, I notice that the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), and the first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply them together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might not need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. \n\nLet me think about that. If I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and I multiply it by any term from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the resulting term will be \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) something involving \\(c\\). But since the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps all those terms involving \\(c\\) just contribute a coefficient, and the \\(a^2b^2\\) part remains as is. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms, each of which would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that can't be right because the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times 64, which is 384? Hmm, but that seems too high. Let me check my reasoning again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part of the expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. So, that doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut as I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients are all the binomial coefficients, but each term has a different power of \\(c\\). However, when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each of these terms, so the resulting term is \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, as before. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that term, I get \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That is, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the problem was just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), which would give 384, but now I'm considering that maybe it's asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would give 120. Which one is correct? Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, I'm confused now. Let me think about it differently. When you have two independent variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the terms are independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear with coefficients multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me verify this with a smaller example to make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute this product and see the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). First, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). Now, multiplying these together:\n\n\\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\).\n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from \\(a^2 \\times 1/c\\) times \\(b^2 \\times c\\), but wait, that's not quite right. Wait, no, in this small example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't actually appear because each term is either \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2/c\\), \\(2ab c\\), \\(2ab/c\\), \\(b^2c\\), or \\(b^2/c\\). So, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product because the variables are separate. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero in this case. But according to my earlier reasoning, the coefficient would be 1 (from \\((a + b)^2\\)) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which is 2, so 1 * 2 = 2. But in reality, the coefficient is zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present. Therefore, my earlier reasoning must be wrong.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So, in the small example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, but according to my earlier method, it would be 1 * 2 = 2, which is incorrect. Therefore, my initial approach was wrong. So, I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a, b\\) and \\(c, 1/c\\) are separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can't be multiplied by any term involving \\(c\\) to give \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(c\\) terms are separate. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but in my small example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero, but according to this new reasoning, it would be 1 (from \\((a + b)^2\\) coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, actually, because \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which is 1 (since \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is zero). Therefore, the product would be zero, which matches the actual result. So, perhaps my new approach is correct.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384, but if it's asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. But in that case, each term would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but that seems unlikely because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have two separate polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is independent of the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will have the form \\(6 \\times \\text{term from } \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But in my small example, that approach failed because it gave a wrong result. So, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, in the small example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, but according to the approach of 6 * 64, it would have given 2, which is wrong. Therefore, that approach is incorrect. So, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first polynomial and \\(c^0\\) is in the second, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\) would expand to \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only to the first power. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1c^0\\) would be zero because each term has either \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), but not both. Wait, actually, no term has both \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) multiplied together to give \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1c^0\\) is zero. Therefore, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1c^0\\) is zero, which aligns with the approach that you multiply the coefficients of the corresponding terms.\n\nSo, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these coefficients together to get 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Since the problem didn't specify the \\(c\\) term, but given the structure, it's likely asking for the term where \\(c\\) is zero, so the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any restriction on \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But in the small example, this approach gave the wrong result, so I think the correct approach is to consider the term where \\(c^0\\), making the answer 120. Therefore, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem**:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But wait, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I also have this other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which I need to consider. \n\nI think I need to multiply the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, which only involves \\(c\\), maybe I can separate these parts. \n\nLet me think. When I multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply as well. But in this case, since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part involves \\(c\\) terms, which don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? \n\nWait, that doesn't sound quite right. Let me clarify. When you have two separate expressions multiplied together, like \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), each term in the expansion of the first expression is multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. \n\nBut the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). However, since the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as in the first part, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part? \n\nWait, no, that's not correct either. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), which doesn't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. \n\nBut since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, when you multiply it by the entire second polynomial, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, right? Because if the exponent of \\(c\\) is non-zero, it's not just \\(a^2b^2\\), but also has some \\(c\\) term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. \n\nThat makes sense. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), I get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. \n\nSo, let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the term that will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied. \n\nSo, set the exponent equal to zero:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0\n\\]\nSolving for \\(k\\):\n\\[\n6 = 2k \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nSo, the term where \\(k = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\). The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\nWait, actually, let me compute that correctly. 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 \u00d7 6) is 720 / 36, which is 20. So, the coefficient is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. \n\nSo, that would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives 6 as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), gives 20 as the coefficient for \\(c^0\\). When we multiply these two polynomials together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But we are only interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nBut wait a second, is that the case? Let me think again. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term is the sum of products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by \\(c^0\\) from the second polynomial. Because any other term in the second polynomial would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make the term in the product have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), which is not just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, yes, the coefficient is indeed 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6, correct. For the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20, correct. So, 6 \u00d7 20 is 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we have to consider that each term in the second part will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), but only the term where \\(c^0\\) will result in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. All other terms will have some power of \\(c\\), so they won't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. Therefore, only the term with \\(c^0\\) in the second part contributes, and that term has a coefficient of 20. So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but hold on, maybe I'm misapplying the concept. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only include the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if the exponent of \\(c\\) is non-zero, the term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\), which is not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), which has a coefficient of 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two independent polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial is 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. But since \\(c^0\\) is just 1, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to see if there's another approach. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the two variables are separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of the \\(c\\) terms. So, it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, if I thought that way, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384, which is different from what I had before. But that can't be right because I'm not considering that only the term with \\(c^0\\) contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, which approach is correct?\n\nWait, let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by \\(c^0\\) from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. On the other hand, if I were to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), then the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 (coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second polynomial). But since the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nSo, I think my initial approach was correct, and the answer is 120. The confusion arose when I considered the sum of all coefficients, which would be if I were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), but since \\(k\\) must be zero, only the \\(c^0\\) term contributes.\n\nLet me just go through it once more to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n   - The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\):\n   - The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n   - We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero: \\(6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\\).\n   - The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply the two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the logic or calculations.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. \n\nWait, but the problem is about the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I can't just stop here because the entire expression is a product of two binomial expansions. That means I need to consider how the terms from each expansion interact with each other. \n\nLet me denote the first part as \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is \\(A \\times B\\). Now, when I multiply two expressions together, each term in \\(A\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). \n\nBut wait, I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to think about whether the terms from \\(B\\) affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Let me see: the terms in \\(B\\) involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the variables in each part are separate. That is, the terms in \\(A\\) involve \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the terms in \\(B\\) involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nTherefore, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\(A\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(B\\). But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in \\(B\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(B\\). Wait, no, that doesn't sound quite right. \n\nWait, let me think again. When I multiply \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(A\\) (which has a coefficient of 6) will be multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). But since \\(B\\) is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, it will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), each with their own coefficients. \n\nBut wait, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\(A \\times B\\), I need to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\(A\\) and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(B\\). Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any other term in \\(B\\), like \\(c^6\\) or \\(c^{-2}\\), that would introduce \\(c\\) terms, which would change the variables involved. So, the only term in \\(B\\) that contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is the constant term. \n\nTherefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand \\(B\\) using the binomial theorem as well. \n\nSo, \\(B = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in \\(B\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) has a coefficient of 6, and it gets multiplied by the constant term 20 in \\(B\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\(A \\times B\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these are multiplied together, the overall coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was recognizing that only the constant term from \\(B\\) would contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term because any other term would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which aren't present in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by expanding each part separately. Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Calculating the binomial coefficients, I get: 1, 4, 6, 4, 1. So, the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6 in this part. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. \n\nLet me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will contribute to the overall product. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I realize that the multiplication by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). It only adds terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will just be coefficients for the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply by any term in the second expansion, it just scales the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by that coefficient. \n\nWait, no, that's not exactly correct either. Let me clarify. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds a coefficient multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think we need to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes a coefficient, and all of these will be part of the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nBut wait, actually, no. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has multiple terms, each with their own coefficients. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds that coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nBut wait, no. Actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the problem. \n\nWait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but we just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it adds that coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nSo, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already did earlier. It's 6. Now, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Is it correct to multiply the coefficient from the first expansion by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion? Let me think about it. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, it will be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q, because each term in Q adds a coefficient to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that makes sense. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product being equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P multiplied by the sum of coefficients in Q, since each term in Q contributes its coefficient to the product term. \n\nSo, to confirm, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of coefficients. The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is indeed found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of the coefficients would be when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), which matches what I found earlier. \n\nSo, I think my reasoning is correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Suppose I don't consider the sum of coefficients, but instead think about the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Then, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times each coefficient in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), summed together. But that's the same as 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to write out the entire product, it would be \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by each coefficient from the second expansion, and since we're adding all those up, it's 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying these gives 6 * 64 = 384.\n\n\\boxed{384}"

But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nLet me think: when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will get multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means we're only interested in the terms where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion won't change the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, every term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, is that right? Let me make sure. So, if I have \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a term in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply by \\(6a^2b^2\\), it's just scaling it by those terms. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, their exponents won't be affected by multiplication with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the final product. \n\nBut wait, actually, no. Because in the entire expression, \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expansion is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\right) \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c} + 15c^4 \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^2 + 20c^3 \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^3 + 15c^2 \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^4 + 6c \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^5 + \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\right)\n\\]\n\nWait, that seems complicated. Maybe I should first compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately. Let me try that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^{6} = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\)\n- \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k = 5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k = 6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nNow, going back to the original expression:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4) \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\n\\]\n\nSo, when we multiply these two polynomials together, each term in the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can focus only on the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial because the other terms (like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(4ab^3\\), \\(b^4\\)) when multiplied by any term in the second polynomial won't result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient will be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is just a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(6 \\times \\text{(coefficient)} \\times a^2b^2 \\times c^{\\text{something}}\\). \n\nBut wait, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those products will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term in \\(c\\), but since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to consider all the contributions. \n\nWait, no, that's not exactly right. Because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each of these, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually the coefficient from the first part (\\(6\\)) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that scales \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, let me clarify. The entire expression is a product of two polynomials. Each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Each of these products will be terms like \\(6 \\times \\text{(coefficient from second poly)} \\times a^2b^2 \\times c^{\\text{something}}\\). So, if we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all these contributions. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nNow, what is the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? To find the sum of coefficients, we can set \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into the expression will make all powers of \\(c\\) equal to 1, so we just get the sum of the coefficients. \n\nSo, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. \n\nSo, going back, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients from the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 is indeed 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. Since each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because for each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), it adds another term with \\(a^2b^2\\), scaled by the coefficient from the second polynomial. \n\nSo, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. \n2. Identify the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. \n3. Recognize that the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n4. To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, we need to multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n5. Calculate the sum of coefficients in the second expansion by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64. \n6. Multiply 6 by 64 to get 384. \n\nYes, that seems solid. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in the second expression is calculated by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. \n\nWait, but the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression. Hmm, maybe I can treat each part separately and then multiply them together. But how does that help me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\); it's all in terms of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be affected by the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that can't be right because the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a term in \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) varies. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that might make sense. Because when you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the first expression (like \\(a^2b^2\\)) would be multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, since each term in the second expression can be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the coefficient. \n\nSo, let me check that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial, you can substitute \\(c = 1\\), because that makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). \n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in the second expression is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Is this correct? Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, each term in the second part is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), but when you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you're effectively summing over all possible coefficients in the second part because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each of them. So, yes, that would be the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, multiplied by 6, giving 384. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a term in the first polynomial is multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my initial approach. \n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, we're considering terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, and any power of \\(c\\), and we want the sum of all such coefficients. \n\nWait, but that's not standard. Normally, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, you're supposed to consider the specific monomial, including all variables. But in this case, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\) or something else. But assuming the problem is correct as written, then perhaps I need to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, which would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me verify that with an example. Let's take a simpler case: suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The expansion would be \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). Now, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\), which is \\(a^1b^0\\), then in the first part, the coefficient is 1. The second part, when you substitute \\(c = 1\\), is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Looking at the expanded form, the terms with \\(a\\) are \\(ac\\) and \\(a/c\\), so their coefficients are 1 and 1, which sum to 2. So, that works. \n\nSimilarly, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient in \\((a + b)^2\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2, so the total coefficient would be 1 * 2 = 2. Expanding, \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\) gives \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). The terms with \\(a^2\\) are \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\), so their coefficients are 1 and 1, summing to 2. So, that works too. \n\nTherefore, it seems that my approach is correct. So, applying this to the original problem: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient in the product is \\(6 * 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me double-check. Another way to think about it is to consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, but since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), all those terms will just add up when considering the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand the entire expression, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each contributing their own coefficient, so when you collect like terms for \\(a^2b^2\\), you'd have 6 times each term from the second expansion, which would sum up to 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but let me also think about whether there's another approach. Maybe using multinomial coefficients or generating functions. But in this case, since the two parts are independent, I think the approach I took is the simplest. \n\nJust to recap: \n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\): that's 6.\n2. Find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): substitute \\(c = 1\\) to get \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n3. Multiply them together: 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Calculating the coefficients, that becomes \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nWait, but the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I have another part multiplied by this, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this as well. So, maybe I should first find the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and then look for the term where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. \n\nBut wait, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the ways that when I multiply terms from the two expansions, the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply it by \\((a + b)^4\\), the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from the \\(c\\) terms. That means, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually independent of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I can treat the two parts separately. \n\nLet me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the product terms won't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, so that means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion would include multiple terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the sum of all the terms in the second expansion. But that can't be right because then it would depend on the value of \\(c\\), which it shouldn't. \n\nWait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all different, when I multiply the two expansions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean that the coefficient isn't just a number, but rather a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering \\(c\\) as a variable and the entire expression, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, no, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, when you multiply out the entire expression, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient 6 from the first part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when we set \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 * 64 = 384? Hmm, that seems high, but let me check.\n\nWait, but maybe that's not the right approach. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because the problem is just asking for a coefficient, implying a numerical value.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but then it's not a single coefficient but a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. That would make sense because then we're looking for a specific term where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the power of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nLet me check that interpretation. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If we're treating \\(c\\) as a variable, then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. That would make the coefficient a number. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which might not be what the problem is asking for. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be an expression involving \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe I should assume that it's looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, let me proceed with that assumption.\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to find all the ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion. \n\nFirst, from \\((a + b)^4\\), as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nNow, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because when I multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, so to get \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. \n\nSo, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. \n\nNow, since the two expansions are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion, so 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6a^2b^2 * 20c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought the coefficient might be 6 times the entire expansion, but that was a misunderstanding. Actually, I need to find the specific term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. So, the coefficient is 120. \n\nLet me double-check my steps:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\n3. Find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) \u2192 \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n4. Multiply the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had been asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be \\(6(c + 1/c)^6\\). But since the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not specifying \\(c\\), it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient when considering all powers of \\(c\\), but that interpretation doesn't make much sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, I think I've got it. The coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term from the second part. \n\n1. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nSo, \\((a + b)^4\\) would have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). The general term in the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. That would correspond to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, let me calculate that term. \n\nThe coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nWait, but the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression. Hmm, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms, right? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, does that mean the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? \n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6\\(a^2b^2\\). Then, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. \n\nBut when I multiply 6\\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, I get terms like 6\\dbinom{6}{k} \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by 6\\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Because when you substitute \\(c = 1\\), you get the sum of all the coefficients. So, let me compute that. \n\nSubstituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has various terms, each with their own coefficients. When we multiply the two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nBut the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That means, in the entire product, all the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since we're only concerned with \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, every term in the second polynomial contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, we can compute the coefficient as the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me consider a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, \\((a + b)^2\\) has \\(a^2\\), \\(2ab\\), and \\(b^2\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present in \\((a + b)^2\\). Wait, actually, in \\((a + b)^2\\), the highest power is \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) would require a higher power, like \\((a + b)^4\\). So, maybe my initial approach is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that when multiplying \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think differently. Suppose I consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Then, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms, each term in the product will have the form \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I didn't think about it that way, I might have tried to find a term that includes \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) for some \\(m\\), but since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, all the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this with a different approach. Let me expand both parts separately and then see how the coefficients combine. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) is expanded as:\n\\[\na^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNext, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is expanded as:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we get a product where each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSince the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from these multiplied terms. That is, for each \\(k\\), the term \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) contributes \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\) to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is:\n\\[\n6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\n\\]\nBut the sum \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\) is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\), as each binomial coefficient sums to \\(2^n\\) for a given \\(n\\).\n\nTherefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not overcomplicating this. Another way to think about it is that since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you're effectively scaling the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those coefficients, and since you want the total coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), you sum them all up.\n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\(2^6 = 64\\), as substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives the sum of coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only appear in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and ignoring the \\(c\\) parts, so the coefficient is just 6. But that seems too simple, and I feel like I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. That is, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the term becomes \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nAh, that makes sense. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. Next, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. \n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product, we multiply the coefficients from each part: 6 (from the first part) and 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Okay, that's straightforward.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I have to consider the product of two expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term in the product where the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) can be anything, but since the problem doesn't specify any constraints on \\(c\\), I think I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but actually, no, because the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when we multiply, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. However, since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you have two separate expansions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expansion. But in this case, the specific term we are interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\), and we don't care about the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I need to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficients add up. \n\nWait, let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^n\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m + n = 6\\) because the second expansion is to the 6th power. So, each term in the product will have some power of \\(a\\), some power of \\(b\\), and some net power of \\(c\\) (since \\(c^m \\times c^{-n} = c^{m - n}\\)). \n\nBut the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we are looking for all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponent on \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every possible term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but is that correct? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, when you multiply out the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every possible term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but let me think about it more carefully. Let me denote \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the product is \\(A \\times B\\). When we expand this, each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(B\\), which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), each with their respective coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). Because each term in \\(B\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(B\\), the coefficients add up. \n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, I need to compute 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). Now, the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Because when you substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(B\\), you get the sum of all coefficients. So, let's compute that.\n\nFirst, let's compute \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(B\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\) is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\(B\\)? Let me think about it differently. Suppose I have \\(A = a^2b^2\\) and \\(B = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, the product is \\(a^2b^2 \\times B\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) (which is 1) times the sum of coefficients in \\(B\\) (which is 64). But wait, in \\(A\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, not 1. So, in the product, it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(B\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the entire expansion. Let me consider that in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), so each term in \\(B\\) contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(B\\). \n\nWait, but let me check with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\), which is 1, times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which is 2. So, the coefficient would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's see: expanding \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). The term \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2 \\times 1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 * 1 + 1 * 1 = 2, which matches the earlier calculation. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, applying the same logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is that the correct approach? Because in the original problem, we're not just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), but actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by all possible powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire product, every term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted differently, where we are to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all variables. But in that case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have to be multiplied by some term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have a power of \\(c\\) which we aren't considering. Wait, but the problem didn't specify any constraint on \\(c\\), so I think the correct interpretation is that we are to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the answer would be 384.\n\nBut let me make sure. Let me try to compute it another way. Let's expand both parts separately and then see how the coefficients multiply. \n\nFirst, as before, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nSo, the terms are:\n- When \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\cdot c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(20c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives us \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I calculated earlier. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it as each term in the second expansion contributing its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), then the total coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but let me think about it differently. Suppose I don't consider the second expansion and just think about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (polynomial in \\(c\\)). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expansion, but since we are only interested in the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in the first polynomial that multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's as if we're treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable and just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\)'s exponent. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I were to collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to compute the product and look for \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have two variables, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another variable \\(c\\). The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) can be from -6 to 6. But when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're only interested in terms where \\(k=2\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(m\\) can be anything. Therefore, the coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about it in terms of generating functions. The generating function for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is \\((a + b)^4\\), and for \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first and the sum of coefficients in the second. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to use generating functions and set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the value of the expression when \\(a=1\\), \\(b=1\\), but that might not be the right approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of it as follows: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think I've confirmed this multiple ways, so I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem to expand each part separately.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, we multiply 6 by 64:\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, how does that work? I think since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). So, maybe I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a constant term with respect to \\(c\\), I want the overall term to be just \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by that constant term. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nLet me think about that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well. So, it would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, to find the constant term, I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. That is, \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me double-check. So, the first part gives me a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part gives me a constant term 20. So, when I multiply them together, I get \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. Alternatively, I could have considered the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions, and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their coefficients don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. \n\nAnother way to think about it: since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) is in the other, the variables are independent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is determined solely by the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and the rest of the expression contributes a scalar multiple. So, yeah, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nI don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by expanding each part separately. Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how that multiplication affects the coefficient. \n\nLet me think: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply as well. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, no, that's not quite right. Because each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut actually, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not correct either because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a Laurent polynomial, meaning it can have negative exponents as well. \n\nWait, hold on. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, no, that's not right either because the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. \n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients don't just add up; instead, each term is multiplied by each term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the product is a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into the expression gives the sum of all the coefficients. So, let's compute that. \n\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\nSo, the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which is a Laurent polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 times the entire Laurent polynomial \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we have to consider that in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nYes, that makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, the sum of the coefficients is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by any term from the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial is in \\(c\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various exponents \\(k\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a constant with respect to \\(c\\). \n\nWait, that's a different approach. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, that would be the sum over all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. \n\nSo, to get \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we need to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 (the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nAh, that makes more sense. So, I was wrong earlier. It's not 6 times the sum of all coefficients, but 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. \n\nSo, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nLet me figure that out. Let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. \n\nThe general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct? \n\nLet me double-check. \n\nWhen I thought it was 384, I was considering that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that's incorrect because the sum of all coefficients is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives the total sum, but in reality, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), not all terms. \n\nSo, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion and multiply it by 6. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, as calculated. Therefore, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure that makes sense. Let's think about it differently. \n\nSuppose I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I multiply them together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is a Laurent polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we have to consider that the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where \\(k = 0\\). So, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, which is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. \n\nTherefore, it's 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the correct coefficient is 120. \n\nI think I confused myself earlier by thinking about the sum of all coefficients, but actually, since we're looking for a specific term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's only affected by the \\(c^0\\) term in the second expansion. \n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\):**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that's \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I can't just stop here. I need to consider the entire product. But the question is specifically asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means, in the entire expansion of the product, I'm only interested in the terms where the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, and I don't care about the powers of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) because they won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nSo, perhaps I can separate the two parts. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which we've found to have a coefficient of 6. Now, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need to see how that affects the coefficient. But actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), those terms will just contribute a constant factor when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, hold on. The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64, which is 384. \n\nWait a second, that seems a bit too straightforward. Let me double-check. So, the idea is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. So, each term in the second polynomial will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. Let me consider the entire expansion. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the second part, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nNow, I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\). The exponent of \\(c\\) will be \\(6 - 2m\\), but since the question is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), it doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\). So, actually, all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears will have different exponents of \\(c\\), but since the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Because for each \\(m\\), we have a term \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for all \\(m\\). \n\nBut the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, that brings us back to \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times 64 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that confirms it. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The original problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but since the question is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), we're effectively summing over all the coefficients that multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, yes, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to compute \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) where \\(6 - 2m = k\\). But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), we have to consider all possible \\(m\\), which means summing over all \\(m\\), hence multiplying by 64. \n\nAnother way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two independent binomial expansions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part, when considered as a whole, contributes a factor of 64 because that's the sum of all its coefficients. So, when you multiply the two, you get 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, to recap: \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\n2. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when considering all its terms, sums up to 64 when \\(c = 1\\). \n\n3. Since we're multiplying the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI don't see any mistakes in this reasoning. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product as \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nNow, I need to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that reasoning. Because sometimes when you have variables, you might have to consider if the second expansion affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But in this case, since the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable, when you multiply, the variables don't interfere. So, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the second expansion's terms are in \\(c\\), they don't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of coefficients. The second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of its coefficients, we set \\(c = 1\\), as I did before, which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and see that the sum of the coefficients is indeed 64. Let me try that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term. The sum of these coefficients is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), which is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I calculated before. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about it another way. Suppose I consider the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for each such term, it's multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. So, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So that confirms it again.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part, when expanded, has a sum of coefficients equal to 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. That seems consistent.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{1} = 2\\), and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so total coefficient is 2 * 2 = 4. Let me check by expanding:\n\n\\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\).\n\n\\((c + 1/c) = c + 1/c\\).\n\nMultiplying them: \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\).\n\nThe coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2 * (c + 1/c), which is 2c + 2/c. But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(ab\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 2 * (1 + 1) = 4, because when you multiply by \\(ab\\), each term in \\(c + 1/c\\) adds a coefficient. So, that's consistent. Therefore, in the original problem, it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Calculating those coefficients, we have 1, 4, 6, 4, 1. So, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Got that part.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts. But wait, the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6. But since this is multiplied by another expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I think I need to consider how that multiplication affects the coefficient.\n\nWait, actually, let me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and the second part is a separate expansion. So, when I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find all the terms in the second part that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), don't change the \\(a^2b^2\\) part. In other words, I need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 1 (or the constant term) from the second expansion.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me clarify. The entire expression is the product of two expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with those involving \\(c\\). So, when I multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that coefficient will be the same as the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of the two expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion isn't a constant.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product as a single expression, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we need to find all terms in the expansion where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything. But actually, no, that's not the case. Wait, no, because \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from any terms involving \\(c\\). So, when you multiply the two expansions, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, in the final product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will actually be multiplied by the entire second expansion, meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that seems confusing because the second expansion isn't a single term.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, you have to consider the coefficients from both parts.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\) which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and I multiply it by \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), which is another expansion, then each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., up to \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that it's the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, that might make sense.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I have \\( (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\) and \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m} \\).\n\nNow, when I multiply these two, I get a double sum: \\( \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m} \\).\n\nThe problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find all terms where \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\). That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives the coefficient from the first part as \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, for each such term, we also have the coefficient from the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and the term \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that means we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\), multiplying the coefficients from both expansions. So, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}\\).\n\nWait, but that sum is \\(6 \\times 2^6\\) because the sum of the binomial coefficients for \\(n = 6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too high. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), so maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that we need to sum over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\\), but when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make more sense because then we can find the coefficient by considering both expansions.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, let's approach it that way.\n\nFirst, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier.\n\nFrom \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. To find that, we can use the binomial theorem again. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384, but now I'm thinking maybe it's asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 384\\). But that seems too large, and usually, problems like this ask for a specific term, including all variables.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but since it's not specified, I'm confused. Let me try to see both approaches.\n\nFirst approach: If we consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nSecond approach: If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need to find the coefficient where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nBut the problem is written as asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\). So, perhaps the intended answer is 120, assuming that the term is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Alternatively, if it's considering all possible terms with \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. But I think more likely, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would require considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the entire expression is a single polynomial, so the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, as each term in the second expansion multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. If I expand the entire expression, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, that seems to make sense.\n\nBut let me check with a simpler example to see if that's correct. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). So, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so the coefficient would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would also be 2. So, that seems to align with the idea that the coefficient of a specific \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) would be the binomial coefficient times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nTherefore, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 120. Let me see why. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120. But the problem doesn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because usually, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term in a product of expansions, it's considering the term with specific exponents for all variables. So, if it's only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), it might be implying that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. So, perhaps the intended answer is 120.\n\nLet me check online for similar problems to see how they interpret it. Hmm, but I can't access the internet, so I have to rely on my reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as that's a more typical problem structure. So, perhaps the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let's think about the exponents. If I'm looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), in the product, that term is multiplied by every term from the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times \\(2^6 = 384\\). So, that would mean the coefficient is 384, and the term would be \\(384a^2b^2\\) times various powers of \\(c\\).\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me try to think of it as a single polynomial. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these, you get terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m}\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, which is 6 times 64, as each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut I'm still unsure because usually, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term without specifying other variables, it might be implying that those variables are at zero exponent. So, perhaps the answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me try to clarify. If I have two polynomials multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of a specific term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) would be the coefficient in \\(P\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\). So, in this case, \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify with a small example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1 times the sum of coefficients in \\(c\\), which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so the coefficient is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) is also 2. So, that aligns with the idea that the coefficient is the binomial coefficient times the sum of the coefficients in the other expansion.\n\nTherefore, applying that to our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is found when \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the entire expression:**\n   The entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will contribute a factor that is multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), I can treat the second part as a constant multiplier for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire product, so maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that when multiplying the two expansions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient, not the term itself, I think that might not be the case. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. But in this case, the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the product will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - m}\\), depending on how the second expansion goes. But since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Since the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), is being multiplied by the first part, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a constant. That doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In that case, I would need to consider all terms in the product that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficients add up. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), setting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) which gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), whose sum of coefficients is 64, then multiplying them would indeed give 6 * 64 = 384 for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think differently. Maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out.\n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together.\n\nSo, let's break it down:\n\n1. Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\): As before, that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): To find this, we can use the binomial theorem again. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 * 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify the exponent of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or specifically when \\(c^0\\)? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which usually implies that we're considering the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a constant. That doesn't make sense because coefficients are constants.\n\nTherefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean the coefficient is 384, which seems large.\n\nWait, but let's clarify. In the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that's not a single coefficient; it's a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a single term.\n\nGiven that, I think the intended answer is 120, where we multiply the coefficient from the first part, 6, by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, 20.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let's consider both interpretations.\n\nFirst interpretation: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). That would mean summing over all possible exponents of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSecond interpretation: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nGiven that the problem didn't specify the exponent of \\(c\\), but just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the first interpretation is correct, and the answer is 384. However, in many problems like this, especially when dealing with multiple variables, the coefficient is often considered in the context of all variables, so if \\(c\\) isn't mentioned, it's possible that they want the coefficient without considering \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. In the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, not the term, perhaps they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the answer would be 384.\n\nBut to be safe, let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 2 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2*(1 + 1) = 4. Alternatively, if we consider \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 2 * 2 = 4 as well because in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 2 (since \\(c + 1/c = c^1 + c^{-1}\\), but there is no \\(c^0\\) term. Wait, that's not right. Wait, \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\), so there is no \\(c^0\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be zero, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 2*(1 + 1) = 4. So, in that case, the answer is 4.\n\nBut in our original problem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) does have a \\(c^0\\) term, which is when \\(k=3\\), as we saw earlier, giving a coefficient of 20. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120, and if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 384.\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify the exponent of \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. However, in the context of such problems, when multiple variables are present, sometimes they're asking for the term where all variables are at their specified exponents, which would include \\(c^0\\). So, perhaps the intended answer is 120.\n\nWait, but in the example I just did, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 2*(sum of coefficients in second part) = 2*2 = 4, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is zero because there's no \\(c^0\\) term. So, depending on interpretation, the answer could vary.\n\nBut in our original problem, since \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) does have a \\(c^0\\) term, perhaps the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let's see. If I consider the entire product, \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and they meant to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let's think about how the problem is phrased: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" The presence of \\(c\\) in the expression complicates things because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which isn't possible because coefficients are constants. Therefore, the only way this makes sense is if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, and multiply them together to get 120.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is found when \\(k = 2\\).  \n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. This occurs when \\(k = 3\\).  \n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**  \n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{120}"

Calculating the coefficients, that becomes \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That means I need to consider the product of two expressions: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nSince multiplication of polynomials works by distributing each term in the first polynomial to each term in the second polynomial, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), unless those terms affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, actually, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the variables are different. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire sum of terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times something, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient, which is a number. Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that suggests that we might be looking for a term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, so that the resulting term is a constant, thus contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will produce terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., depending on the term it's multiplied by. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the only way that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be a standalone term is if it's multiplied by a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Because then, \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1 = a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in.\n\nSo, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply these two, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\), which is the term we're looking for.\n\nTherefore, I need to compute two things:\n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6.\n\n2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nOnce I have both coefficients, I can multiply them together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nSo, let's work on the second part: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nAgain, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k}\\) which simplifies to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply these two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient of \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part, which is 1, and the coefficient is 20. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the entire expansion. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). \n\nSo, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is the one where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel each other out, which, as I found earlier, is when \\(k = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, resulting in a coefficient of \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\): the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. The binomial coefficients for both expansions are correctly calculated, and the multiplication is straightforward.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6.\n\nNext, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

    "text": " \n\nSo, \\((a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). \n\nOkay, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I guess I need to consider how that multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nLet me think. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since multiplication distributes over addition, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the other terms in the expansion. That is, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply, but the variables also multiply. However, in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), their exponents won't interfere. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. However, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^5\\), etc., up to \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, each of these terms will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the original question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, that might not be the case. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nBut that doesn't seem right either because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, like \\(a^2b^2\\), in a product, you might be considering the term without any other variables. But in this case, since \\(c\\) is also present, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But it's not specified, so maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a sum of all terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing to the coefficient. \n\nWait, but that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, not an expression. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). \n\nThat makes more sense. So, the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would be a specific term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. \n\nSo, let's approach it that way. First, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. Then, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once we have that, we can multiply the two coefficients together to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product. \n\nOkay, so let's focus on \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because we want \\(c^0\\). So, set the exponent equal to 0: \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these two coefficients are multiplied together in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait a second, let me double-check that. So, when you have two expressions multiplied together, the coefficients multiply for the corresponding terms. So, in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expression and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second expression will multiply, giving \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20c^0 = 120a^2b^2c^0\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 120. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to think of the entire expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion, but we're only interested in the term where the power of \\(c\\) is 0, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120. \n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me recap. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\n3. Find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0: \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) gives \\(k = 3\\). \n\n4. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\n5. Multiply the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I'm confident the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\((a + b)^4\\) will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). So, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \n\n\\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider the entire expression. \n\nSince the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that means I need to consider the entire product and find the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the \\(c\\) terms can be anything because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Or maybe I need to ensure that when I multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by some term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't matter. \n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, is that right? Let me make sure. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\text{some terms}\\), then when I multiply them, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) (for some exponent \\(k\\)) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not multiplied by any \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that doesn't make much sense because the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be 6 * 64 = 384? But that seems too big. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the \\(c\\) terms cancel out. Let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Hmm, maybe it's considering the entire expression, so \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the part with \\(a^2b^2\\) and ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, but that doesn't make much sense because the expression is a product. Let me try a different approach. \n\nLet me denote \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I multiply A and B, each term in A is multiplied by each term in B. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from A will be multiplied by each term in B, which are of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in A will have a coefficient of 6, and when multiplied by each term in B, it will produce terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which could be interpreted as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in B, because each term in B contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by 6. The sum of the coefficients in B is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(B\\) becomes \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but that seems a bit off because in the product, each term is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term involving \\(c\\). So, unless we're considering the coefficient independent of \\(c\\), which might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning that the \\(c\\) terms cancel out. Let me check that. \n\nIf that's the case, then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in A, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in B. So, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem again. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That seems more reasonable. So, the answer is 120. Let me double-check that. \n\nIn \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense because when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by the constant term (c^0) from the second part, resulting in a term \\(120a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but earlier I thought the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not necessarily \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so maybe it's considering the entire product, and the coefficient would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient of a term in a product usually refers to the coefficient of a specific term, considering all variables. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is multiplied by the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients are combined. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written in a way that it's actually \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as I calculated earlier. \n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is written without any variables beyond \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but the expression includes \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that we're treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nBut that seems a bit odd because usually, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a specific term would require all variables to match. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. But I'm not entirely sure. \n\nWait, let me think again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms with different powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and each of those terms is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nBut wait, that seems to contradict the earlier interpretation where we're looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which gave 120. So, which one is correct? Let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. But I can't be sure. \n\nWait, perhaps I can approach it differently. Let me consider that in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Let me try to think of it another way. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\), then the second part becomes \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Then, the product becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I set \\(c = 1\\), I'm effectively summing all the coefficients in the second expansion, which gives me the total contribution to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, that seems to support the idea that the coefficient is 384. \n\nBut then again, if I don't set \\(c = 1\\), and instead look for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), that would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think the problem is ambiguous, but given the way it's written, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 384. \n\nWait, but let me check the original problem again: it's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would mean that the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But in reality, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first. \n\nSo, if I denote \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(B = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A \\times B\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\), which is 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think I need to decide which interpretation is correct. Since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 384. \n\nBut to be thorough, let me consider both interpretations. \n\nFirst interpretation: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). Then, it's 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nSecond interpretation: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Then, it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the second interpretation, because otherwise, why include the \\(c\\) terms? It might be that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning that the \\(c\\) terms cancel out. \n\nWait, let me think about the structure of the problem. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's possible that the problem wants the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. That would make sense because otherwise, the term would have a \\(c\\) component, which might not be intended. \n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nLet me confirm that. In the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent is zero, which happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, multiplying by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, gives 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), but given the structure, it's likely that it's asking for the coefficient where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, so the answer is 120. \n\nI think I've thought through this enough, and I'm confident that the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

Calculating the coefficients, that's \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the expansion of both parts and then find the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\). However, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, I don't think they interfere with each other in the multiplication. That is, the terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply independently. \n\nSo, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and multiply them by the corresponding terms in \\((a + b)^4\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think the coefficient will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again.\n\nActually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression multiplies each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for a specific term in the product, like \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the ways that multiplying terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can give me \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that doesn't sound quite right. Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part, which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and multiply it by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the resulting term will be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(something with c)}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by every term in the second expansion. \n\nBut that seems a bit confusing. Let me try to clarify. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. In this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial by any term in the second polynomial, because the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial. But actually, the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first polynomial) multiplied by 64, which is 384. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64 because when \\(c = 1\\), it becomes \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, when you multiply these two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I expand both parts separately, then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that term as \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and when we multiply it by the entire second part, it becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), effectively scaling it by the sum of the coefficients. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of coefficients is 64, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the second polynomial has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the entire second polynomial is effectively scaling the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by 64. So, the coefficient becomes 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it as each term in the product being a combination of terms from both expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can come from selecting \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part. Since the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients. \n\nSo, to recap: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the coefficient in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Let me compute \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately. Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of all coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is indeed \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, that part is correct. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). The product would be \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 (from \\(a^2\\)) times (c + 1/c), which when considering coefficients, it's 1*(1 + 1) = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2*(c + 1/c), so the coefficient is 2*2 = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) is 1*2 = 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is 1 (from \\((a + b)^2\\)) times 2 (from \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) evaluated at c=1). So, that seems to align with the method I used earlier. \n\nTherefore, applying the same logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but just to double-check, let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and see what the sum of coefficients is. As I did before, substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives 2^6 = 64, which is correct. So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 384. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."
