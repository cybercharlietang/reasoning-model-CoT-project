    "text": " Wait, so for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the expansion of the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Hmm, does that mean I need to consider how the second part affects the coefficient? Wait, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, actually, when you multiply out the two expressions, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second part. So, when you expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, right? Because the second part doesn't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), it only affects the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when I expand it, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, for example, \\(a^4\\) from the first part will be multiplied by \\(c^6\\) from the second part, giving \\(a^4c^6\\), and so on. Similarly, \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so it'll be \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of the second part. Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible terms. But since the second part only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), it doesn't contribute to the powers of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the only term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first part, and it's multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, no, because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of these, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we are looking for the coefficient when considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, but it's multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so it's not a single term but multiple terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's possible that the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we need to sum over all the coefficients from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, meaning that we're considering all possible terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's just 6, because the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. I'm getting confused here. Let me try another approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present with coefficients multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\right)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, no, the problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem is in the context where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\) are variables, and we're looking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would indeed be 6, because the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients multiply. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the product are the convolutions of the coefficients of the original polynomials. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all possible products of coefficients from the first expansion and the second expansion that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second expansion only has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the first expansion has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by any term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. Because if we're looking for the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., the constant term, then the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure. Let me check. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, maybe that's the answer. Alternatively, if I set \\(c = 1\\), I'm essentially summing all the coefficients in the second expansion, which gives me the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the answer is 384. Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me try to think differently. Suppose I don't set \\(c = 1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial. So, the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, the problem must be asking for a specific term, perhaps the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering the constant term in \\(c\\), is 120. Hmm, that seems more reasonable. So, maybe the answer is 120. But I'm not sure. Let me confirm. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, perhaps it's expecting the sum of all coefficients, which would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term, it's 120. I'm a bit confused here. Let me think about how the product works. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is not a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's expecting a polynomial, but the problem says \"the coefficient\", which is usually a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is 120. So, maybe that's the answer. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I think the more likely intended answer is 120, considering that the problem is about coefficients in a product, and often such problems ask for specific terms, possibly the constant term. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we consider the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\nCalculating the binomial coefficients, that becomes:\n\\[\n1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That means I have to multiply each term of the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term of the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, the resulting term will still have \\(a^2b^2\\), but multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). However, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, hold on. Let me read the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". Hmm, so actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any combination from the second expansion, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion, right? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients add up when the variables match. But in this case, the variables are different: one part has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the other has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, actually, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different, so when you multiply the two expressions, each term from the first will be multiplied by each term from the second. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by any term in the second part. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that seems too big. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part is multiplied as a whole. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering that the product includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be paired with any term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is the coefficient in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that seems unlikely because the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient would be 6, regardless of the second part. But that seems too straightforward, and the problem includes the second part, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, which would be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a separate expansion. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no, that approach is not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the variables are different, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the first polynomial's \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible powers of \\(c\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\( (1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64 \\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. But let me verify this because I might be making a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). That is, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). If that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nWait, that makes more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense for a numerical answer. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, let's calculate the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nSo, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, I'm a bit confused. If it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer, it's more probable that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), in which case the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number, so that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense for a numerical answer. So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of the second part, but that seems incorrect because the second part affects the overall expression.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of one don't affect the coefficients of the other unless the variables are the same. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That would make sense, and the answer would be 120. Let me check that again.\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire second expansion, but that would be a polynomial, not a number. So, I think the intended question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think about how the product works. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\\). So, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is not a single number but a polynomial. Therefore, unless the problem specifies a particular power of \\(c\\), the coefficient is that polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's ambiguous. However, given that the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer, I think it's more probable that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something like that, but as it is, I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms with various powers of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each of those terms, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., down to \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 120, because that's the constant term when considering \\(c\\). So, I think that's the answer they're looking for.\n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is likely what the problem is asking for.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Wait, but actually, I don't need to expand the entire thing, just the part that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(k = 2\\), right? Because then \\(a^{4 - 2}b^2 = a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), maybe the \\(a^2b^2\\) term doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all? So, does that mean the coefficient from the second part is just 1? Hmm, no, that doesn't sound right. Wait, actually, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first part, then I need to multiply it by the entire second part. But wait, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. Wait, no, actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which would be terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that is, the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times whatever from the second part. Wait, but that's not a single term. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's in the entire product, so we need to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), or is it just the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\)? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is considered as a term on its own, and we need to find how many times it appears when multiplied by any term from the second expression. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\), because the sum of coefficients is found by setting variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Hmm, but that doesn't seem right either. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, we need to find the term in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, that would involve taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiplying it by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part. So, first, the coefficient from the first part is 6, as we found. Now, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not necessarily multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then we have to consider all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which would be 6 * \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not a single coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe it's just 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Hmm, but that seems unlikely because when you multiply two expressions, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the entire second expression, meaning that the coefficient would vary depending on the power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying a power of \\(c\\), perhaps it's expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. But that seems too simple, so maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. Let me check that again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and to get \\(c^0\\), we need the middle term in the second part, which is when \\(k=3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire second expression, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, I think the intended interpretation is that we need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering the term from each part of the product that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\n1.

    "text": " Wait, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I need the term where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2. Since the exponent is 4, the sum of the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) should be 4. So, if \\(a^2b^2\\) is the term, that makes sense because 2 + 2 = 4. So, using the binomial theorem, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is equal to \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I guess the coefficient I found, 6, is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), right? So, does that mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But actually, when you multiply two polynomials together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), but in the expansion, it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a constant term, it remains as a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), whereas if it's multiplied by a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would become something else. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that constant term, it contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, first, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, that's 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Let me just double-check my reasoning. I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then found the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20, because when you multiply these two, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by 20, resulting in the coefficient 120. That seems correct.

    "text": " Wait, actually, I don't need to expand the entire expression because I only care about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I can just find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the term for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(k = 2\\) because the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(k\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

But wait, since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), I think that part of the expression doesn't affect the coefficient. So, does that mean the coefficient remains 6? Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how it interacts with \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and it's being multiplied by terms from the second part, which involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient should just be 6 multiplied by whatever coefficient comes from the second expression when considering the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, but actually, the second expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate expansion. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, maybe the coefficient is just 6. But let me double-check that. Let me think of it as two separate expansions. The first expansion is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term from the second expansion. However, since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I need to consider the terms in the second expansion that result in \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a constant with respect to \\(c\\). So, actually, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), I still get \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient will be the product of 6 and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expression. So, that means I need to compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work that out. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). I need the term where the exponent is 0, so I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), I get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion, the coefficient becomes \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).

Is it correct that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\)? Yes, because when you multiply the two expansions, each term is multiplied, and only the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.

Because when you multiply by each term, you're effectively scaling the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by each coefficient in the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, no, that's not quite accurate. Let me think again.

So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. \n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning. \n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) (positive or negative) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, but that's not how coefficients work. The coefficient of a specific term, like \\(a^2b^2\\), would be the sum of all the products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some term from the second expansion. So, each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire sum of coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut wait, let me check that. The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think about how the multiplication works. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, each term in the second expansion is something like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, I get terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), because each term contributes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me confirm this with a different approach. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But no, that's not correct because each part is a separate variable. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine by convolution, not just multiplication. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it again. \n\nWait, but in this case, the variables \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\) are all different, so when you multiply the two polynomials, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), just scales it by that coefficient, and since we're looking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), we sum all those contributions. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, as I found earlier, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, so the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, I can treat the second factor as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first factor, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire second factor, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier thought where I thought the coefficient would be a number. So, maybe I need to clarify what exactly is being asked. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), specifically \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that seems odd because usually, when someone asks for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, they might be considering the coefficient in the combined polynomial, which could involve multiple variables. But in this case, maybe the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me re-express the problem. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that seems to be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a number. So, maybe the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that I can treat the second polynomial as a scalar multiple. But that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial is in \\(c\\), so it's not a scalar. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. To do that, I can consider each part separately. \n\nFirst, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nNext, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. \n\nSo, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. \n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but earlier I thought the coefficient would be 384, but that was when considering all coefficients in the second expansion. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would include all powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. \n\nI need to clarify what the problem is asking. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nBut wait, in standard polynomial terms, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expanded form, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which might not be what the problem expects. \n\nWait, maybe I should check the problem statement again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, in the expanded product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. \n\nWait, that's the same as saying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to evaluate it further or to recognize that the coefficient is a polynomial. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply expecting me to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire second expansion, so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^l c^m\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(k=2\\) and \\(l=2\\), regardless of \\(m\\). \n\nBut in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms with various powers of \\(c\\), each term in the product will be \\(6 \\times \\text{term from second expansion}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that can't be right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. \n\nIf that's the case, then as I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't mention \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part, but that's not correct because the coefficients are in different variables. \n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all possible exponents of \\(c\\) of the products of the coefficients. So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's still a polynomial. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is expecting me to evaluate the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 384, which is a number, but in reality, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, I'm confused. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is in the context where \\(c\\) is a specific value, but the problem doesn't specify that. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something similar, but that's just a guess. \n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because usually, when you're asked for a coefficient, it's a number, not a polynomial. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense in this context. \n\nWait, maybe I should look for an alternative approach. Let me consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense, and the coefficient would be a number. So, let me proceed under that assumption. \n\nSo, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nNext, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is found by setting the exponent equal to zero. \n\nUsing the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nThus, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer might be 384, but that was when considering the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. \n\nI think I need to decide which interpretation is correct. Since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. However, in standard problems, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials with multiple variables, it's usually considering the term with the specified variables and the other variables set to their lowest or highest power, but in this case, it's not clear. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to treat the entire second polynomial as a constant and just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. But that seems unlikely because the second part is clearly part of the expression. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the correct approach because the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, but when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(6 \\times 64 \\times a^2b^2\\), which would be the coefficient. But that seems to treat \\(a^2b^2\\) as a single term, which it is, but the coefficient would then be 384. \n\nWait, but that would mean that every term in the second polynomial contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is correct because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each coefficient, effectively summing all the coefficients from the second polynomial and multiplying by 6. \n\nSo, perhaps the correct answer is 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials, \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) will have terms where each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire \\(Q(c)\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. \n\nTherefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me check with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\). \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1. \n\nNext, \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). \n\nIf I multiply them, I get \\(a^2c + a^2 \\times 1/c + 2abc + 2ab \\times 1/c + b^2c + b^2 \\times 1/c\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. \n\nBut if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2c^0\\), then it's the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. But in this case, the second polynomial doesn't have a \\(c^0\\) term, so the coefficient would be 0. \n\nWait, but in the original problem, the second polynomial does have a \\(c^0\\) term, which is 20. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nTherefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), and the answer is 120. \n\nBut to be thorough, let me compute both possibilities. \n\nFirst, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nIf it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nGiven that the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), but just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nWait, but in my earlier example, when I took \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be \\(6 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number, so perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to treat \\(c\\) as a variable and just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be \\(6 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), but that seems odd because the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, which would involve all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, perhaps I should go back to the problem statement and see if I misread something. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). \n\nIn standard polynomial terminology, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all possible powers of \\(c\\) that could multiply \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but in my earlier example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\) was \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial, which would be \\(6 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number, so perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nI think I need to make a decision here. Given that the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), but just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the intended answer is 384, as that's the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial multiplied by 6. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me think about how the problem is phrased. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the context of the problem, it's possible that the question is expecting me to treat \\(c\\) as a variable and just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that seems odd because the coefficient is usually a number. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nI think I need to go with the interpretation that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the answer is 120. \n\nBut to be thorough, let me compute both. \n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nIf it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nSince the problem didn't specify, but given that it's a common type of problem, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the answer is 120. \n\nWait, but let me check the problem again: it's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the variables are separate, so when you expand, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps the problem is expecting me to evaluate this polynomial at a certain value of \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial, but that seems unlikely. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\), but that's just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nI think I"

    "text": " \n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that's \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider both parts together. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, but I need to consider how this term interacts with the second part. Wait, actually, no. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables, and \\(c\\) is another variable, so the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That is, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are determined only by the first part, and the powers of \\(c\\) are determined by the second part. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not exactly right. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be of the form (coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\)) times (coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)) times the corresponding variables. But since the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the part involving \\(c\\) will just add more factors, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), does that mean that the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? But that doesn't make sense because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). Wait, that can't be right because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), every term in the product will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Hmm, that's a bit confusing. \n\nWait, no, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all the terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems too large. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I should consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product as a single expression and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems like it's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but perhaps it's actually a typo, and they meant the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is to the power of 0. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve terms with \\(c\\), which isn't a number. So, maybe I should interpret the problem as asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right. So, maybe I should proceed under the assumption that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. \n\nSo, let me try that approach. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nFirst, as I did before, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6. Now, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, we want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 because we're looking for \\(c^0\\). So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nNow, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two parts together, the coefficients multiply, so 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. \n\nBut wait, the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating by including \\(c^0\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all the possible terms from the second part, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a numerical value. So, perhaps I was correct the first time, and the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the expansion, which again is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, which would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think differently. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. \n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me try to see if the problem is written correctly. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems like an unusual question because it's not a numerical coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that's not a standard way to phrase such a question. Usually, if they want a numerical coefficient, they would specify a particular term involving all variables. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think again. When you have two separate variables, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another variable \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nBut that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense as a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, as I calculated earlier, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a typo, and they meant to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^3\\) or some other specific power of \\(c\\). But without more context, I have to go with the information given. \n\nWait, let me try to think differently. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times that expansion, which is 6 times \\(\\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\right)\\). \n\nBut that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me check that again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and get the term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and then multiply it by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, in this product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 20. Wait, no, that's not right. \n\nWait, no, because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is 120a^2b^2. So, the coefficient is 120. \n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that \\(c\\) is another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a numerical value. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nLet me double-check that. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, when you multiply these two parts, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We seek the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient here is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That means I have to consider the second part as well, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, how does that interact with the first part? Well, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the terms in the first part are only in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the terms in the second part are only in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, but since the variables are different, each multiplication will result in a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, does that mean regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\)? Hmm, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it means the coefficient of the term that has exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), and the coefficient for each such term would be 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think that means we're just looking for the total coefficient, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that might not make sense. Because in the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that seems too large. Wait, no, actually, each term in the second expansion is a term with a coefficient and some power of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire sum of the coefficients of the second expansion. But that doesn't seem right because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), which don't interfere with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that can't be right because the second expansion's terms have different powers of \\(c\\), which would make the entire product have terms with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, unless the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, but the problem didn't specify that. It just said \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe I need to clarify. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that's not possible because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, the sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, but that would require considering each term separately. Wait, no, because in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each of these coefficients, so 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384. But that's the same as before. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, perhaps the problem is considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is indeed 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the entire sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nBut wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient would just be 6, and the rest is multiplied by the second part. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that seems too large. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, but that would require more precise calculation. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. \n\nThe problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. But that seems too big. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is 6*(sum of coefficients in the second expansion). As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only 6, and the rest is separate. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, the coefficients combine. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nBut let me verify this with a different approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). Simplifying, that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\). That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for each such term, we have the coefficient from the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) the coefficients from the second expansion. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me think again. If I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), then the entire expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 16 \\times 64 = 1024\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. So, if I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), the value of the entire expression is 1024, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) contributes 384 to that. But that seems plausible because 384 is less than 1024. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only 6, but that doesn't account for the second part. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384. \n\nBut wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient would just be 6, and the rest is multiplied by the second part. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second expansion. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually \\(6a^2b^2\\) times the entire second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the problem. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That is, the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in that case, I would need to find the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, and then multiply that by the coefficient from the first part. \n\nLet me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, as I thought earlier, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient would just be 6, and the rest is multiplied by the second part. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second expansion. \n\nWait, but that can't be, because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, I must have misinterpreted the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That is, the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in that case, I would need to find the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, and then multiply that by the coefficient from the first part. \n\nLet me try that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, as we found earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nBut the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I'm confused. If it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient is 384. If it's \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. But the problem didn't specify the \\(c\\) term, so perhaps it's 384. However, given that the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's possible that it's expecting the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning 384. But I'm not entirely sure. \n\nWait, let me think about it differently. If I consider the entire product, each term will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as we found earlier. For each such term, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, that's \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nBut that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 6*20=120. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written in such a way that it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the answer is 384. \n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because usually, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient is considered in the entire expression, meaning that you have to account for all variables. But in this case, the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just 6, but that seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that can't be. Therefore, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give the desired term. In this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the second polynomial, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, I must have made a mistake in interpreting the problem. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's actually \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^6\\) or something like that, but no, it's written as \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the rest is separate. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, the coefficients combine. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the terms involving \\(c\\) are separate, so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems incorrect because when you multiply, the coefficients do combine. \n\nWait, let me think differently. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems to confirm my earlier result. \n\nBut if I set \\(c = 1\\), I'm essentially evaluating the expression at \\(c = 1\\), which gives me the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times that sum, which is 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I set \\(c = t\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(t\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so I think the intended answer is 384. \n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes problems like this expect you to consider only the specific term where the exponents match, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), I think the correct approach is to multiply the coefficients. \n\nWait, let me try to write out the product. The first part is \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when you multiply these two, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2/c^2 + 36a^2b^2/c^4 + 6a^2b^2/c^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120, because that's the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nWait, that's different from my earlier conclusion. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will have \\(a^2b^2\\) with no \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. \n\nBut the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I'm confused. If it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial. But if it's \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^6\\), but no, it's written as \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*64=384. But if I set \\(c = 1\\), I'm evaluating the expression at \\(c = 1\\), which gives me the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I set \\(c = t\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(t\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so I think the intended answer is 384. \n\nWait, but when I multiplied out the terms earlier, I saw that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. So, perhaps the problem is expecting that, considering that it's more likely to ask for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. \n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nBut when I multiplied out the terms, I saw that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if you consider the entire product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), where each term corresponds to a different power of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's ambiguous unless it specifies the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the most likely interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6*20=120. \n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Calculating the binomial coefficients, that would be \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, I think that when I multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to consider how the other terms in the expansion affect this specific term. So, perhaps I can focus only on the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just a scalar (6) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and then when I multiply by the other expression, I'm just scaling it by each term in the second expansion. \n\nBut actually, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct either because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only one term, so when I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(6a^2b^2\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the context of the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the coefficient isn't just a single number but a polynomial in terms of c. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the coefficient in the entire expression, considering both parts. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The original problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is typically a numerical value. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating c as a variable as well, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in c. But that seems a bit odd because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient, you're looking for a numerical coefficient, assuming all variables are treated as independent variables. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all variables. So, perhaps I need to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in that expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that seems a bit too broad. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of c, so it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense either because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are dependent on the powers of c. \n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in that expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that seems too vague. Let me try a different approach. Let me consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating c as another variable. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{-m}\\) for some m. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the term where k=2, so from \\((a + b)^4\\), it's 6a^2b^2. Then, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is multiplied by 6a^2b^2. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't give a single numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of c, meaning that we're considering all possible terms and just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting c=1, so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating c as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But I think the problem expects a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm missing something. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the powers of c, meaning that we're looking for the sum of all coefficients that multiply \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's what the problem is asking for. \n\nWait, let me try to think differently. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, the c terms become \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when k=2 in the first part. So, for k=2, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, the term from the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually 6 times each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that's a polynomial in c, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all variables. So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But if the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating c as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some k, but it's not specified. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, meaning that we can treat the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a scalar multiple. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can substitute c=1, which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384. \n\nWait, but that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then considering that it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient is 6 times that expansion. But again, that's a polynomial, not a single number. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating c as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the answer is \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of c, so the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nUsing the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^m}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of c is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, that makes sense because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, then we're effectively looking for the term where the c exponents cancel out, i.e., the constant term in the c expansion. So, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nLet me double-check that. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed when m=3, which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 times 20 is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. \n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). Okay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the expansion of that part as well. However, I'm only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Or do I need to find a specific term in that expansion as well?\n\nWait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So, actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific term involving \\(c\\), maybe the answer is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Wait, that doesn't sound right.\n\nHold on, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. When you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients of the resulting terms are products of coefficients from each expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and since that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's just multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Is that correct?\n\nWait, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for various exponents \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6, and it's multiplied by each term in the other expansion. But that seems off because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which would be \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be 6 * 64 = 384?\n\nWait, but that seems too large. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6. But that can't be right because the entire expression is multiplied by the other expansion, so the coefficient would involve the sum of coefficients from that part. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\). So, in other words, it's 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the other expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not certain if that's the correct approach. Maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since the other part is independent, the overall coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the other part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to see. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, when you multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the coefficient of a term in P(a, b) times Q(c) would be the coefficient in P(a, b) times the sum of coefficients in Q(c). So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try a different approach. Suppose I expand both expressions separately and then multiply them. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, as we found. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for k from 0 to 6.\n\nNow, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting c = 1, which gives us \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I set c = 1 in the second expansion, I get the sum of its coefficients, which is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, and the second part is a polynomial in c, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not making a mistake here. Suppose I have two expressions, P(a, b) and Q(c). When I multiply them, each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in P, then in the product, it will be multiplied by every term in Q. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient in P times the sum of coefficients in Q. So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the answer should be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not confusing coefficients with terms. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from P(a, b) times the entire sum of coefficients in Q(c). So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6, but that doesn't seem right because the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all the coefficients from the c terms. So, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me try an example with smaller exponents to see if this approach works. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). Now, the product is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 times (c + 1/c), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 * (1 + 1) = 2, because the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 times (1 + 1) = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1 times 2 = 2. So, in this case, the approach works. Therefore, applying the same logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in my small example, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2, which is correct because \\((c + 1/c)\\) evaluated at c=1 is 2. So, in the original problem, the sum is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the product of two independent expansions. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of coefficients from the other part. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I don't need to consider any specific power of \\(c\\), just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which when summed gives 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n3. Multiply the two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

So, maybe I can find just the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nUsing the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I want the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would happen when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Let me think. \n\nI think the expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. So, when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the terms from the second expansion will just multiply by 1 for the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, actually, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand that, it will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), etc., but none of these terms involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are independent of the \\(c\\) terms. That means, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't sound right because the coefficient should just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), since the other part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the second expansion would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a single term, so the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times something, but that something isn't a single number. I'm confused now.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\)? Or is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\)? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That would mean that when you expand the entire expression, you collect all terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and then sum their coefficients. But that seems complicated because there are multiple terms with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing its own coefficient.\n\nWait, but that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, that seems plausible. Let me check again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms with various powers of \\(c\\), but when I multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the second expansion will contribute its own coefficient to the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) would be the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion multiplied by 6. Since the sum of coefficients is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems contradictory because \\(c\\) is part of the expression. Wait, no, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so it's just the coefficient, regardless of the other variables. So, in the product, each term would be of the form \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), and the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I should approach it differently. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the power of 0. That would make sense because then it's a specific term. Let me check that possibility. If that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, in that case, I would first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nThat seems more likely. Let me go with that approach. So, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, we multiply the coefficients from each part: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), giving us \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but earlier I thought the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would have given me 384. Now, if it's asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. So, which one is correct? \n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" The way it's phrased, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, which includes \\(c\\) terms. So, unless specified, I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. So, perhaps I need to clarify. Wait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which in algebra typically refers to the term where the variables have those exponents, regardless of other variables. So, in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of a larger expression that also includes \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients for terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). \n\nBut that seems a bit odd because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, you're considering the term as a whole, including all variables. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, but in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges depending on the second expansion. But the problem is only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), not involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. So, that can't be right. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, the result is a product where each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by the entire second expansion, it becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's an expression, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, without considering the second part. But that seems odd because the problem includes both parts. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me think about how the product works. The product is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6a^2b^2, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, it becomes 6a^2b^2c^k, where k ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it would be the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any k, which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think I need to clarify this. In algebra, when we talk about the coefficient of a term in a product, we usually consider the term as it appears in the entire expression, including all variables. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. However, in many contexts, it's understood that we're considering the term with \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, perhaps the intended answer is 120. \n\nBut to be thorough, let me consider both interpretations. \n\nFirst interpretation: The problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That would mean summing over all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). As I calculated earlier, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nSecond interpretation: The problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. In that case, it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nGiven that the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the first interpretation is more likely. So, the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. If the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because coefficients are numbers, not expressions. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. \n\nWait, perhaps I can check by considering the entire expansion. The entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the product is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all terms where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for all \\(m\\) such that \\(6 - 2m\\) can be any integer. But since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), it's unclear. \n\nWait, but if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) multiplied by the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nAlternatively, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nGiven that the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the first interpretation is correct, and the answer is 384. \n\nWait, but in that case, the coefficient is 384, which is a number, so that makes sense. So, I think I'll go with that. \n\nSo, to summarize: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\nSince the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we multiply the coefficient from the first part by the sum of coefficients from the second part. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the binomial coefficients, that would be \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think the coefficient I just found, 6, is just for the part \\((a + b)^4\\), but since this is multiplied by the other term, maybe I need to consider how that affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nHmm, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and see how they interact with the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nWait, but actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is in the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be affected by the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, no, that doesn't seem quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the variables are different, so the coefficients shouldn't add up. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since the variables are different, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is independent of the \\(c\\) terms. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire expression. So, perhaps the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all present, and we're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, we're treating \\(c\\) as another variable and looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's considering the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\), and just looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term or something. \n\nWait, no, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me try again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a single coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible terms, but since \\(c\\) is another variable, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but the question doesn't specify. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we can treat \\(c\\) as a constant. But that doesn't make much sense either. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but considering that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the entire second part. But that still doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. \n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me try to think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the product as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nBut that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because the question is asking for a single coefficient. Maybe the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but I think that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but that would mean summing over all possible coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which would be complicated. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think of it differently. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems like an unusual way to present the answer. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, and since the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a separate polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems incorrect because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), considering all variables. But since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can have any power of \\(c\\) multiplied by it. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which suggests that it's a single number. So, perhaps I'm missing something here. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that we can treat \\(c\\) as a constant and just multiply the coefficients. But that's not correct because \\(c\\) is a variable, not a constant. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to approach it differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I did before. Then, since the other term is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is multiplied by the entire \\((a + b)^4\\) expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd. \n\nWait, but maybe the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like the answer would be a polynomial, which the problem might not be expecting. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that we can treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that still doesn't make sense because the coefficient is supposed to be a single number. \n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these are two separate polynomials being multiplied, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. \n\nBut that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But I don't think that's what the problem is asking. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, that seems plausible. Let me check that again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by this sum, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is indeed 384. \n\nBut wait, does that make sense? Because when you set \\(c = 1\\), you're essentially evaluating the second polynomial at \\(c = 1\\), which gives you the sum of its coefficients. Then, multiplying by \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64. So, yes, that seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire expression as a product, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nSo, I think the answer is 384. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my reasoning. \n\nFirst, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is 6. Then, since the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I considered that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of coefficients, I set \\(c = 1\\), which gives 2^6 = 64. Therefore, 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficient from the first part by the sum of coefficients from the second part:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I can't just stop here; I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Hmm, so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the product of the coefficients from each part? Let me think. Actually, no, that's not quite right. Because the entire expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. So, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. Wait, is that correct? Let me see. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will contribute a term that's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\), the coefficient will actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, no, because the second part is a separate binomial expansion, so when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), we can consider that the coefficient will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, is that right? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each of those. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. But let me make sure. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me find the sum of its coefficients. To find the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial, you can substitute 1 for all variables. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) times 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term. So, actually, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then any term from the second expansion that has a non-zero power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) and result in a term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would not be \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, only the constant term in the second expansion (i.e., the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by, say, \\(c^k\\), that would give a term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is not \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero in the second expansion would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. Instead of multiplying by the sum of all coefficients, I should only multiply by the coefficient of the constant term in the second expansion. So, let's correct that. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because \\(c^0 = 1\\), that's the constant term. So, let's compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me check again. So, the first part gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part has a constant term 20, so when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. So, the answer should be 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the second expansion. Let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) again. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need 6 - 2k = 0, so k = 3. So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is 20. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.

Because the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(1\\) (since we don't want any \\(c\\) terms, just \\(1\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and no \\(c\\) terms in the second part, that would be the term where the second part is just a constant. Let me think. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term that gives a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) would be when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel each other out. So, if I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). I want this exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), I get \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k=3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second expression is 20. Now, going back to the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion. So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. Now, since the two expressions are multiplied together, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term would be the product of these two coefficients. So, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part) equals 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). And in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(k=3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct.

So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some terms from the second part. But wait, does that affect the coefficient? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think. Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first factor, and the second factor is in terms of c. So, when you multiply them, the terms involving a and b are separate from those involving c. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is separate. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be 6 times whatever the entire second part is. But that can't be right because the second part is a sum of terms with c. Wait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms. So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something with c}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too big. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again. It says: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps, the question is to consider the entire expression as a product, and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating c as another variable. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in c, which seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, considering all variables. But that would mean that we're looking for the term where a is squared, b is squared, and then the rest of the terms would involve c. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to consider the entire expression as a product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where a is squared, b is squared, and c is to the zero power. That would make more sense because then we're looking for a specific term where the exponents of c cancel out. So, perhaps that's what the problem is asking. Let me check the problem again. It says: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Hmm, it doesn't specify anything about c, so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a bit strange because it would still be a polynomial in c, not a single number. So, maybe the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where a is squared, b is squared, and c is to the zero power. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, perhaps that's what is intended. Let me proceed under that assumption. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we get a product where each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) times \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term will be \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we are looking for the term where the exponent of c is zero, i.e., \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for m: \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) => \\(2m = 6\\) => \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where m = 3 is the one where c cancels out. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Now, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming we're considering the term where c is to the zero power) is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through it again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) which is 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\) which simplifies to \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of c is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want this exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives m = 3. The binomial coefficient at m=3 is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the term is \\(20c^0\\). Therefore, when we multiply by the 6 from the first part, we get 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering the c terms, is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), where the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), giving \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, the coefficient I found earlier, which is 6, is just part of the expansion. I need to consider how this multiplication affects the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think about this.

So, when I multiply the terms from both expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since I'm only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the other part of the product, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), can contribute any term, but it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts.

But wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, effectively contributing to the overall coefficient. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), I might be misunderstanding something here. \n\nWait, no, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so when we multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand it, each term will be of the form \\((a^kb^{4 - k}) \\times (c^m (1/c)^{6 - m})\\), which simplifies to \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^{2m - 6}\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from when \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), so that's the term from the first expansion, which is 6a^2b^2. Then, when you multiply this by the second expansion, each term in the second expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{m} (1/c)^{6 - m}\\) which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{2m - 6}\\). So, the entire term in the product would be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{2m - 6}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we need to collect all the terms where the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, each term in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product should just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. \n\nPerhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nBut let me verify that. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when expanding, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion has a coefficient of 6, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check that again. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term in the first part, and the second part is independent, so the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, I think my initial approach is correct. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. So, each term from the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it's just scaled by the entire second expansion, so the coefficient becomes 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in interpreting the problem. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which means that in the expanded form, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that is the product of the coefficients from both expansions for that specific term. But since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a constant factor when considering \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first expansion, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nSo, to find the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, I can substitute \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(some term from the second expansion)}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nSo, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), whose sum of coefficients is 64 (found by setting \\(c = 1\\)). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. But wait, that's just the first part. The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe I can think of it as multiplying each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps I don't need to consider all the terms, only the ones that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply them together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the terms involving \\(c\\), right? So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression should just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by any term from the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), then actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second polynomial adds a multiple when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the result will be a term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would only happen if the term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\), because only then would multiplying by \\(a^2b^2\\) give a term that still has \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, I think that's the key. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

The problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, when I expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider the coefficient as \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not accurate. Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), each of those will contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64.

Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.

So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, and the rest of the expression doesn't matter because it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Let me check that again. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right.

So, when you multiply them, the terms will involve all combinations of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, perhaps I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term, and then multiply that by the coefficient from the first part. \n\nLet me check that approach.

The problem statement is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be the sum of all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). \n\nBut that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, resulting in \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each of those terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut earlier, I thought maybe it's asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, which is it? Let me check the problem statement again. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's considering the entire product, so the coefficient would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, meaning the constant term. So, maybe the answer is 120. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to clarify. \n\nIn the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is 6, as before. Then, for each \\(m\\), the term from the second part would be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, but that seems like it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then 384 is correct. However, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. \n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, it's a bit unusual to ask for the coefficient of a term that's multiplied by various powers of another variable. So, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the product, each term is a combination of powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would mean all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the sum over all possible exponents of \\(c\\) of the product of the coefficients from each part. \n\nSo, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm getting conflicting interpretations. Let me try to look for similar problems or think about how such problems are usually phrased. Typically, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a specific term in a product of expressions, it's considering the term with all the variables as specified. So, if it's asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), it might mean the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But in this case, since the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, let me confirm this by considering a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). Let's compute this product. The expansion of \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). Expanding this, we get \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). \n\nNow, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in this case, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the first expansion only goes up to \\(b^2\\), and the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe I should take another example where both parts involve variables. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think differently. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the sum of all products of coefficients from each part where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively. Since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the coefficient from the second part is the sum of all its coefficients, which is 64. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to find the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second part. But since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but in the expansion, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, which are \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6 * 1 = 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would be 6 * 6 = 36, and so on, down to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\) would be 6 * 1 = 6. \n\nBut the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would include all these terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems correct because each term in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present is multiplied by a term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all those products. So, 384 is the correct coefficient. \n\nBut earlier, I thought it might be 120, but that's if we're looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, I think the confusion comes from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) or specifically \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nWait, let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the correct answer should be 384. \n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because sometimes problems like this ask for specific terms where all variables are considered. Let me try to think of it another way. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then the expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 (1 + 1)^6 = (a + b)^4 * 64\\). In this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384, which matches my earlier calculation. \n\nAlternatively, if I set \\(c = 1\\), I'm effectively summing all the coefficients in the second expansion, which gives me the total contribution of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\). So, that seems to confirm that 384 is the correct coefficient. \n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384. \n\nWait, but I just realized something. The problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term in the product will have exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). But when the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's considering all possible terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum of all products of the coefficients from each part where \\(a^2b^2\\) is involved. \n\nIn other words, the coefficient is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because sometimes problems like this are designed to have you consider only the constant term. Let me try to think of it differently. Suppose I'm looking for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), giving 120. \n\nBut the problem doesn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I think it's more accurate to say that the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which, in the context of the entire product, would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, I think the correct answer is 384. \n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure because in some contexts, when you're given an expression with multiple variables, asking for the coefficient of a term with some variables might imply that the other variables are set to specific values or that their exponents are zero. But I don't think that's the case here. The problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it should include all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384. \n\nWait, but let me try to calculate it another way. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with exponents of \\(c\\) ranging from 6 to -6. Each of these terms has a coefficient. So, when I multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by each of these, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nThe sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think I've convinced myself that the correct answer is 384. \n\nWait, but I just thought of another way. Let me consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, so it's the sum over all possible exponents of \\(c\\) of the products of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nYes, that seems correct. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute the entire expansion of the second part and sum the coefficients. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficients are:\n\n- \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\), term: \\(c^6\\)\n- \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\), term: \\(6c^4\\)\n- \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\), term: \\(15c^2\\)\n- \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), term: \\(20c^0\\)\n- \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\), term: \\(15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k = 5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\), term: \\(6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k = 6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\), term: \\(c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients is 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64, as I calculated earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nTherefore, after all this thinking and checking, I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficient from the first expansion by the sum of coefficients from the second expansion:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"
