So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\) on \\(c\\). I need to find the value of \\(m\\) where the exponent is 0, because that's the term \\(c^0\\). So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will only be multiplied by the constant term in the second part to give a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) terms). Any other term from the second part would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want because we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that makes sense.

Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 for the constant term, so 6 times 20 is indeed 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, to double-check, I can think about the entire expansion. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term in the second part. Since the second part's constant term is 20, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. This happens when \\(m = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these coefficients together gives the final result: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
