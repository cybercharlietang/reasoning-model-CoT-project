The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) and 20 (from the \\(c^0\\) term).

Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part as 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part as 20. Then, since we're multiplying these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) (with coefficient 6) by the constant term (with coefficient 20), giving 6*20=120. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider if there's any other term in the second expansion that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by a term from the first expansion. But since the second expansion only has terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), any term from it would have a non-zero power of \\(c\\), except for the constant term. Therefore, only the constant term in the second expansion would, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in a term without \\(c\\), which is what we're looking for. So, yes, 120 should be the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1.

First, I correctly identified that to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) where \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for the second part, I correctly set up the binomial expansion and found that the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).

Wait, but let me double-check that. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the terms where the product doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, that is, where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, which only happens when we multiply by the \\(c^0\\) term in the second polynomial. So, the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial multiplied by the constant term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. Hmm, but let me think again. Is there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\)? For example, if I have a term with \\(c\\) in the first polynomial and \\(c^{-1}\\) in the second, but no, the first polynomial is only in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so it doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the only way to get a term that's purely in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) (without any \\(c\\) terms) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, let me consider an alternative approach. Maybe expanding both parts and looking at the product. But that might be more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using generating functions. Wait, no, I think the way I did it is correct.

    "text": " Let me focus on the second part now: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) and solve for \\(k\\). That gives \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.

Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of these two expressions, we multiply the two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, I found the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the constant term in the second part, which is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only affected by the constant term in the second polynomial.
