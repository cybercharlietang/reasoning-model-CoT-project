So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, correct. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, correct. So, when you multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's actually the product of 6 and 20, which is 120. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. Let me consider the entire product: \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I expand both separately, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), we're effectively looking for the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Because any other term in the second expansion would introduce a \\(c\\) term, making the product have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but we only want \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies \\(k = 0\\). So, that's why we multiply 6 and 20 to get 120. I think that makes sense. Let me just verify with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) when expanded will have terms like \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, the constant term is 20, which is correct. So, when we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But when we collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) will be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would imply that we need to consider all possible \\(k\\), but wait, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, unless \\(k = 0\\), it won't be just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, in that case, we do need to multiply 6 and 20 to get 120. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), then it would still be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), but that's not the case here. The problem specifically asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think implies that it's looking for the coefficient when the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients we found from each part.

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that.

In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is 0, which occurs at m=3, so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}=20\\), that seems right. So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from choosing 2 a's and 2 b's from the first part, and then choosing the constant term from the second part. So, yes, that makes sense. So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the expansion of each part separately. \n\n1.

Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6. Then, I considered that to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it must be multiplied by the term with \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. I correctly identified that the exponent of \\(c\\) must be 0, which occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any errors in the binomial coefficients or the exponents. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me just double-check that. So, when you multiply two terms together, each term from the first polynomial multiplies each term from the second. But since we're only interested in the term where the product doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, that means we take the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that is \\(a^2b^2\\) (which has coefficient 6) and multiply it by the term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that is \\(c^0\\) (which has coefficient 20). So, yes, 6 * 20 is indeed 120. I think that makes sense. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n\nWait, hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand the product, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because any other term in the second expansion would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the product have a \\(c\\) term, which is not part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired exponent. But in this case, since the desired term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get it is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the constant term from the second polynomial. So, that's why it's just 6 * 20.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The logic seems sound. I used the binomial theorem correctly for both expansions, found the necessary coefficients, and multiplied them together. So, I'm confident the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).

The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, which should be the coefficient. I think that makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply the constant term from the second part, and there are no other terms in the first part that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\). So, yeah, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that each part of the product is independent. So, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are in one part, and the \\(c\\) terms are in the other. Therefore, when looking for a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), we have to take the term from the first part that has only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and the term from the second part that has no \\(c\\) (i.e., the constant term). So, that's why we multiply the two coefficients together. If the problem had asked for a term that involved \\(c\\), say \\(a^2b^2c\\), then we would have to find a term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 1, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), we only need the constant term from the second expansion.
