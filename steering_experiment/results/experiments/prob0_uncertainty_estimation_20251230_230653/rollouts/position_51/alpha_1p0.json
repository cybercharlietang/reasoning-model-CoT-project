So, I think that's the right answer. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait a second, hold on. Let me think again. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2. Then, when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, it would be 6a^2b^2 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\). So, that term would only come from the 6a^2b^2 multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, yes, 6*20=120. So, that's correct. Alternatively, if I consider the entire expression, \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the constant term in the second part, it's just 20. So, 6*20=120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), that's where the 20 comes in. So, yeah, 120 is correct.\n\nI think I'm confident with that answer.

The coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which corresponds to \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."
