Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be obtained by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) (from the first polynomial) with each term in the second polynomial, but only the term that has \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. The other terms would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which would make them \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are different terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is indeed the product of the coefficient from the first polynomial and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. I think that makes sense. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem.

Multiply these two coefficients together because when you multiply the two polynomials, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial is multiplied by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second polynomial to give the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product.\n\nSo, 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1.
