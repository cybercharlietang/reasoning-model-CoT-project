Hmm, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term is of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m (1/c)^n\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m + n\\) ranges from 0 to 6, with \\(m - n\\) being the exponent for \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, that corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), and then any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but actually, when you multiply, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, so the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are determined solely by the first polynomial, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are determined by the second. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we only need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second polynomial, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but actually, no, that's not correct because the entire term would have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some \\(c\\) term. Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're considering the entire expression, and we need to collect all terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But wait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that's not standard. Typically, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term in a product of polynomials, you're considering the term where the variables match exactly. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, but it would be multiplied by all possible terms from the second polynomial. But that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) ranges appropriately. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a bit ambiguous. Wait, actually, no, because in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear if it's multiplied by a term that has \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) in it. So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean that the coefficient is the sum of all products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term in the second polynomial. Wait, that doesn't make sense because each term in the product would be a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be present if it's multiplied by a term that has \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) attached. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. So, that brings us back to 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, I think my initial approach was correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first polynomial and \\(c\\) is in the second, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second polynomial.
