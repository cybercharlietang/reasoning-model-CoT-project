    "text": " So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term (which is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2) and the \\(c^0\\) term (which is 20). So, the product would be \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2\\), which is 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me think again: is there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\)? For example, if I took a term with \\(c\\) from the second polynomial, but then the first polynomial would have to have a term that cancels out the \\(c\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), I don't think that's possible. So, the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), so that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. That's correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. So, when you multiply them, you get 6 * 20 = 120. So, that's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first polynomial and the constant term from the second, their coefficients multiply. So, yeah, 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

    "text": " So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) would result in a term that's purely \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the entire expression as a product of two polynomials and consider how the terms interact. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c^0\\) from the second part. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would come from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part. But wait, no, because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different terms. So, the only way to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second polynomial, which is \\(c^0\\). So, that's why we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which we found as 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 20, which is 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made any calculation errors. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, that's correct. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, that's also correct. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider expanding both parts a bit more. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would expand to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but only the 20 would result in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But the variables are different, so the terms are independent. Therefore, the only way to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 20. So, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had variables that overlapped, like both having \\(a\\) terms, that would complicate things, but in this case, they're separate variables. So, yeah, 120 should be the coefficient.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely thorough, let me consider if there's any other way \\(a^2b^2\\) could appear. For example, if there was a term in the second polynomial that had \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), but in this case, the second polynomial is only in terms of \\(c\\), so no, there's no way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) except from the first polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
