So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has the constant term (c^0) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expression.

So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the product of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial's constant term is 20, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. So, that confirms it.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here.
